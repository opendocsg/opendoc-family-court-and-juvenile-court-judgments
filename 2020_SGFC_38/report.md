Child Maintenance – Section 69 Women’s Charter

9 April 2020

### District Judge Goh Kiat Yi:

### Introduction

1       This is the Complainant mother’s (“the mother”) application against the Respondent father (“the father”) for the maintenance of the children of the marriage.

2       After hearing the matter, I ordered the father to pay the mother a sum of $2,400 as monthly maintenance for the children (being $1,000 for the elder child and $1,400 for the younger child) with effect 4 January 2020.

3       The father appeals against my decision.

### Background facts

4       Parties were married on 21 July 2012. They have two children to the marriage, D and J, who are 6 and 5 years old respectively (“the children”).

5       It is undisputed that the relationship between parties had deteriorated, leading to the father’s departure from the matrimonial home sometime in March 2019. Prior to his departure, he had been paying the mother a sum of around $3,000 as maintenance for the children. However, this amount was decreased to around $1,000 sometime in July 2019. It is not disputed that the father also paid extra sums to the mother for various expenses of the children.

6       The mother then filed the present application for a maintenance order for the children. It should be highlighted at the outset that the father does not dispute that that a maintenance order should be made. Parties differ only on the quantum payable. The mother sought a total sum of $4,000 per month whilst the father was prepared to pay $1,600.

### The law on the issue of quantum

7       Section 69(4) of the Women’s Charter provides that the court, when ordering maintenance of a child, shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including amongst other things, the financial needs of the child and the standard of living enjoyed by the child. Generally, the court also considers the financial circumstances of the parents in determining the amount of maintenance to be paid.

8       I therefore consider the children’s reasonable expenses, before turning to the financial circumstances of the father and mother respectively.

### The children’s reasonable expenses

9       The mother’s claim for the children’s reasonable expenses are around $2436.40 for D and $3066.40 for J.[^1]

10     The father’s position on their expenses was initially unclear as he was self-represented. It appeared from the table in his unsworn statement filed in the proceedings that he was setting out the amount he _was prepared to pay_ for each individual expense item rather than what he thought were the reasonable expenses that both parents should be responsible.[^2]

11     I therefore took some time during the first tranche of the trial to clarify the issue that the reasonable expenses of the children is separate from the eventual apportionment between parents as to the amount they should respectively bear.[^3] The father, having clarified the same then proceeded to put his position on the various items across to the mother during when he cross-examined her.[^4] He also clarified some of his positions on the stand when cross-examined by counsel.[^5]

12     With parties’ positions in mind, I set out my assessment of D and J’s expenses in the following tables with brief reasons given for each item. I further elaborate on the some of the specific items where necessary.

#### Mortgage / Rental

13     On the issue of the children’s share of the accommodation expenses, the mother originally claimed an amount for the payment of the mortgage of the matrimonial flat at Pasir Ris but had since amended her claim for a rental of a condominium at Toa Payoh during the trial. This is because the daughter had secured a place at XX Primary School in 2020 and she wanted to move nearer to the school and her parents who live in the Newton area. The father’s disputes this head of expense.

14     I did not allow the mother's claim for the following reasons. First, the father did not agree to the current rental arrangement. Whilst there was evidence of discussions back in mid-2019 that the matrimonial home was to be rented out, parties did not reach any agreement. Second, the mother chose to rent a condominium unit instead of a lesser price HDB flat. Whilst I do not doubt her intent to be as close to D's primary school and to her parents, there is insufficient evidence that other places, even in an area beyond Toa Payoh could not have been considered. Third, the matrimonial flat itself was not fully rented out based on the tenancy agreement.[^8] It is therefore conceivable that the current rental amount could have be covered by the leasing out of the entire matrimonial flat. The mother should have only moved out when she was certain that she could cover the current rental. Finally, if the mother had continued living in the matrimonial flat, there would be no additional cash outlay as she is presently paying the mortgage through CPF. [^9]

#### Conservancy Charges

15     In view on my findings that she should not have incurred the additional rental expenses above and these are cash payments, I allowed the mother's claim.

#### Transport (School Bus) – D only

16     In view of my position that the mother should have continued living in the matrimonial flat/move to another cheaper alternative apart from Toa Payoh), I allowed D’s school bus claim which was originally not disputed by the father at $120.

#### Enrichment / Tuition

17     The father does not dispute the swimming and church class for the children amounting to $80 per month.[^10] As for mandarin classes, the father argued that there are cheaper options around and was prepared to pay $100 on a reimbursement basis.[^11] The mother took the view that a group class setting would be more beneficial for the children and they enjoy the existing class.[^12]

18     I agreed with the father that the cost of Chinese lessons could be reduced to $100 for a private tutor to be engaged, especially in view of the parties’ financial circumstances and significant debts owed. However, I disagreed with the father that this should be on a reimbursement basis as this would require the mother to constantly approach him for reimbursement. I also preferred to factor the amount into the quantum of maintenance ordered for the mother’s budget for tuition.

#### J’s school fees

19     The mother gave evidence that J will be commencing his new childcare in Toa Payoh. The father was of the view that this amount is high and questioned why he was not consulted on the change.

20     Whilst I understand the father’s dissatisfaction, I did not think that the mother was unreasonable since the elder girl has already secured primary school at XX Primary School. It is reasonable for the younger child to attend any available childcare in the vicinity. The sum of $650 claimed is in any event a reasonable sum.

#### Summary of the court’s assessment

21     I assessed D and J’s expenses to be $1,500 and $2,050 respectively.

### The Father’s income

22     The father’s income was the subject of much dispute. The father claims to earn around $4,000 a month. He claims to have three sources of income. First, is his employment with YY Pte Ltd (“YY”) for a period of one year for a monthly fee of $2,000. During the hearing, he informed the court that he no longer earns this amount as the project has stopped since September 2019. The second source of income is his new business set up with Japanese associates known as ZZ Pte Ltd (“ZZ”), which pays him a basic of $2,000 a month. Third, he also act as a freelance broker in the car wholesale business from which he earns a fluctuating amount of commission.

23     The mother alleges that the father earns far more than he claims at $8,000 per month. This is in part due to the amounts of unexplained deposits into his POSB bank account.[^13] The mother further argues that he spends around $400 a month on restaurants, which suggests he leads a lavish lifestyle and he is therefore a man of means.

24     Broadly speaking, having considered the documentary evidence, observing the demeanour of the father I was unable to accept the mother’s contention that the father has been significantly underdeclaring his income. I elaborate further on the deposits that the mother says should be considered part of the father’s income.

#### The deposits by Miss L

25     In relation to the deposits by one Miss L in his bank statements, [^14] the father gave evidence that Miss L from YY Pte Ltd is in fact his girlfriend and that the sums she transfers to him are loans to him to help him with his financial difficulty.[^15] This relationship did not appear to be seriously disputed by the mother.

26     I accepted the father’s position as the amounts transferred by Miss L were also mostly small amounts from time to time, and are consistent with his position that they were to help him with his expenses. Given the nature of the relationship between Miss L and the father, it is also not surprising that there is no documentary loan agreement between them. I thus excluded the deposits from Miss L from my tabulation of the father’s income.

#### Other unexplained deposits into the father’s account

27     As for a sum of $2,100 (which was not a small amount) transferred on 24 July 2019, I accepted the father’s explanation which was supported by the bank statement that the amount was loaned to him by L and immediately transferred out to pay his debts.[^16] I excluded this amount from the assessment of his income.

28     As for the $1,000 cash deposit on 15 June 2019, I accepted the father’s explanation that the cash belonged to Miss L and it was deposited into his account for convenience as Miss L did not have a POSB bank account. [^17] His version is supported by the bank statements that show the sums transferred back to Miss L’s account on the same day.[^18]

29     I also note that there was deposit of $2,000 by one P on 12 March 2019. As the father was not cross-examined on this deposit, I gave him the benefit of doubt and did not regard this as part of his income.

30     I also accepted the father’s evidence that other small sums were loans from friends. I thus also excluded the same from his income tabulation.

#### The father’s salary or commission

31     The father accepts the following deposits as his salary or commission:

> a.     $1,000 on 9 January 2019[^19]

> b.     $2,500 on 4 April 2019[^20]

> c.     $3,800 on 17 April 2019[^21]

> d.     $1,300 on 22 April 2019[^22]

> e.     $1,000 on 10 July 2019[^23]

32     The father partially disputes a deposit of $6,250 by way of a telegraphic transfer on 20 June 2019. The father alleged that this was a transfer from Japan of which $2,000 was payable to him as commission, and the remainder was for the company ZZ.[^24] The mother argues that the entire sum was his commission.

33     I was unable to accept the father’s contention. First, he has not provided any documentary evidence to support his position. Second and more importantly, the available evidence in the form of his personal bank account and ZZ’s business account do not support him.

34     A closer look his personal bank account shows that there are no transfers of a sum of $4,250 (which is the amount purportedly due to ZZ being $6,250 less $2,000). There are also no piecemeal transfers of amounts coming up close to the figure.[^25] Instead, the pattern of withdrawals from the father’s accounts since 20 June 2019 were regular and of a low quantum. These showed that the monies were utilised by the father to meet his expenses. Likewise, there has been no deposits of any sums into ZZ’s business account since then.[^26]

35     I thus considered the full amount of $6,250 as his commission.

#### The court’s assessment of the father’s income as gleaned from the bank statements

36     I set out in the following table the amounts I included as part of his income as gleaned from the 7 months of bank statements.

37     For completeness, I note that the father alleged during the trial that the engagement with YY has ceased since September 2019 and he would no longer receive the consultation sum of $2,000.[^28] I did not accept his position as the letter of engagement between himself and YY states clearly that his engagement runs until 31 January 2020.[^29] The father has not provided any other documentary evidence from YY proving that they are no longer obliged to pay him for his consultation. I also considered that YY is run by his girlfriend, Miss L, and she would unlikely have terminated the engagement without due regard to the father. Further, I also note that the father gave evidence that he will start receiving more income from ZZ in February 2020.[^30] This coincides with the time that his contractual engagement with YY ends on 31 January 2020.

38     Taking into account the foregoing, I assessed of his take home income to be an average sum of **$6,000** per month rounded down from the average amount.

### The father’s expenses

39     The father’s original claim of his monthly personal expenses is $1,475. At the hearing, he accepted that there should be a reduction of his petrol expenses to $120.[^31] I further note that his claim for pet expenses was on the on the high side.[^32]

40     Contrary to the mother’s submissions, I also did not accept her allegation that he is spending lavishly on restaurants as he had given evidence supported by the bank statements that he had primarily brought the children to restaurants they liked. This is reasonable since he sees them less now after the breakdown of the marriage. I also accepted his claim on the utility bills that were supported by payments through AXS in his bank statements.[^33]

41     I thus accepted that his monthly expense at around $1,317.[^34] This is a reasonable sum, which is far less than approximately $3,000 the mother claims as her own personal expenses considering his higher assessed salary than hers.[^35]

### The father’s debts

42     It is undisputed that the father has several debts.

#### Personal debts to friends and family

43     I did not consider that the debts as due to his friends and family should be deducted from his monthly cash flow, as there is no evidence of any demand of repayment, nor proof that he has been paying them.

#### Debts for AA and the banks

44     The father has evidence to show that he also owes monies to two banks.[^36] He also the produced a settlement agreement for the debts that his previous business, AA solutions, owed to other company (“the AA debt”).[^37]

45     I accepted that the father would have to be responsible for the AA debt, as clause 2 of the settlement agreement clearly states that the father will be personally responsible for a full outstanding sum of $97,562.46.[^38] It is also not disputed that AA solutions was his business during the marriage, and he would have to pay these amounts under the settlement agreement. Based on the settlement agreement, he is obliged to pay $25,000 over a period of 12 months. This comes up to $2,083 per month. If he does not pay these business debts, he could potentially be made a bankrupt. Given the father’s lack of qualifications[^39], this will make things even more precarious for him. I thus deducted the sum of $2,083 from his monthly cash flow.

46     As for the two bank loans, I agreed with the mother’s submissions that there is no debt reconsolidation plan or a fixed amount that he pays a month and I disallowed the same. The court allowed him the opportunity to produce documents even at the second tranche of the trial, but save for a sum of $500[^40], there is no evidence that he makes monthly repayments. I also note that he would be able to start repaying these debts upon paying up AA debt.

47     Based on the foregoing assessment, the father is left with around $2,600 per month for the purposes of maintenance (being $6,000 less $1,317 for his personal expenses and $2,083 for his AA debt). I note that this sum excludes repayment of his bank loans and other loans to friends and family that he would eventually have to repay.

### The mother’s income

48     It is not disputed that based on the mother earns a net monthly income of around **$4,000.00**. This can be gleaned from her IRAS notice of assessment.[^41]

### The mother’s expenses and debts

49     I note that the father did not cross-examine the mother on her personal expenses. Nonetheless, I considered a claim of $2,976 to be on a high side given her financial difficulties.

50     As far as her debts are concerned, I did not accept her claimed monthly repayment to friends and family as the father has acknowledged on record that these debts are his responsibility.[^42] I accepted that she has to pay a monthly sum of $1,400 to pay on the vehicle loan from being the remainder of the hire purchase after the sale of the vehicle[^43] as well as her Maybank Debt Reconsolidation Plan of $1,210.[^44] These two items alone add up to more than $2,600.

51     I did not think that it was necessary to consider each item of her personal expenses as it was quite likely that she would have a monthly negative cash flow (even if I were to assess her monthly expenses to be equivalent to the respondent’s reasonable expenses of $1,317). I also note that she would have to bear her own portion of the children’s assessed expenses.

### Maintenance amount

52     I turn now to my assessment on the quantum of maintenance for the father to pay.

53     Section 68 of the Women’s Charter obliges both parents to maintain the children. Based on their assessed incomes of $6,000 and $4,000, the father should bear at least 60% of the children’s assessed expenses as a starting point. This comes up to around $2,100.

54     However, I found that it was fair to adjust his contribution upwards in view of the following factors. First, as I found at \[50\], the mother’s currently has significant debts and it is likely that she will have a negative cash flow. Second, I note that the children are primarily in her care and their accommodation are presently borne fully by her. Although the mortgage is currently paid through her CPF, the evidence shows that the funds in her ordinary account is depleting.[^45] It is conceivable that she will have to top up payments in cash. Third, she will also have to bear her share of the children’s assessed expenses, which is estimated at $1,420 (being 40% of $3,550). In these circumstances, I considered it necessary to order the father to contribute a further $300 (around 7.5% more) towards the children’s maintenance. This will amount to **$2,400** per month.

## Conclusion

55     I therefore ordered the father to pay the mother a sum of $2,400 (being $1,000 for D and $1,400 for J) with effect from 4 January 2020 and thereafter on the last day of the month into the mother’s designated account

56     In the final analysis, taking into account all the circumstances including their income, expenses and debts respectively owed by both parties, I was of the view that the amount ordered is a reasonable sum. Whilst I have no doubt that the mother wants the best for her children, she must be realistic in these circumstances. In this regard, the mother’s claim of $4,000 was excessive. Even in an intact family, when there are financial difficulties, the amount of monies that parties afford to pay for the children will have to be lowered. That is how families cope with challenges. At the same time, the father must also share a fair burden of the children’s expenses. He has to prioritise his debt repayments accordingly so that the children’s needs can continue to be met.

57     It was amply clear to me having heard parties that both of them have the interest of the children at heart. I was also heartened to hear that the children appear to have a good relationship not only with the parents but also with their respective grandparents. I think the children would still be able to do well in this positive environment notwithstanding the dissolution of the marriage. I encourage the parents to continue working together for D and J.
