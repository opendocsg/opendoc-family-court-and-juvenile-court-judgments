Family Law – Maintenance of wife – Maintenance of child – Women’s Charter (Cap. 353), sections 69(1) and 69(2)

11 February 2020

### District Judge Guy Ghazali:

## Introduction

1       This is an application by the Complainant-Wife (“the Complainant”) against the Respondent-Husband (“the Respondent”) for an order for the maintenance of herself and the only child of the marriage.

2       Parties married on 18 April 2014 and are presently in the midst of divorce proceedings in the Syariah Court. According to the Respondent, he has pronounced _talak_ on the Complainant on 16 March 2019. As at the date of my orders herein, the Syariah Court has not confirmed the _talak_. As such, the Complainant remained a “wife” for purposes of her application for maintenance under section 69(1) of the Women’s Charter. It is also undisputed between the parties that the Respondent has since entered into another marriage and is presently living with his second wife. The Respondent moved out from the parties’ 4-room HDB matrimonial flat in March 2019.

3       The Complainant is 32 years old. She is working in a private architectural firm as an architect.

4       The Respondent is 33 years old. He is a commercial pilot.

5       There is one child to the marriage, male, aged 4 years. The child is attending childcare.

## The Complainant’s claim

6       The Complainant has sought a total monthly maintenance of $8,522 for herself and the child. In arriving at this figure, the Complainant has declared her personal expenses as $5,383.60 per month and the child’s expenses as $2,738.40 per month. A breakdown of these expenses is set out at \[21\] below. The Complainant has also included a credit card expense of $400 per month in her calculation.

## The Respondent’s position

7       The Respondent is unwilling to make any sum of maintenance for the Complainant but is prepared to pay $500 per month for the child.

## Complainant’s earning capacity

8       Before I address the issue of expenses, I will first deal with the parties’ income and/or earning capacity.

9       The Complainant has provided her salary slips showing that she was earning a monthly gross salary of $4,600 with a monthly take-home salary of $3,970.50 (including transport and telephone allowances). The Complainant’s Notice of Assessment for the Year of Assessment 2019 shows an annual income of $61,061. However, it was the Complainant’s position at trial that for the month of September 2019, she suffered a 5% pay cut. As a result, her monthly gross salary for September 2019 was $4,350 and her monthly take-home income for that month was $3,786.50 (including transport and telephone allowances). The Complainant also produced her salary slip for September 2019 to support her account. According to the Complainant, her salary would be further reduced by 5% each month, up to a maximum of 20% pay cut, at which time, her salary would stagnate until further notice.

10     It is noted that prior to moving to her present firm, the Respondent was employed by a statutory board. According to the Complainant’s testimony, her last-drawn salary with her previous employer was $5,200, excluding bonuses. The Complainant’s Notice of Assessment for the Year of Assessment 2018 shows an annual income of $83,832, which is $22,771 more than the annual income in her Notice of Assessment for the Year of Assessment 2019. It is the Complainant’s evidence that she decided to move to an architectural firm (despite the pay cut) as she wanted to be registered with the Board of Architects. In order to be able to do so, she needed two years of practical experience in architectural work and to pass the professional practice examinations.

11     For purposes of the Complainant’s application, I have ascertained her earning capacity to be $83,832 per year as derived from her Notice of Assessment for the Year of Assessment 2018. Whilst she is earning less now, she has done so out of her own will, with a view to ultimately secure better prospects in her profession. As such, any present reduction in pay is likely to be temporary until she obtains her professional qualification.

## Respondent’s income

12     It is the Complainant’s claim that the Respondent earns $15,000 per month. In his affidavit, the Respondent has averred that his gross income is $12,126 per month while his take-home income is $10,902 per month. According to the Respondent’s testimony, his take-home income comprises of two components, namely, a fixed component and a variable component.

13     Having considered the Respondent’s salary slips for the months of January 2019 until June 2019, it is apparent to me that his basic pay is $8,900.82 per month. After deductions, he takes home $8,402.82 per month, not including the variable component. The variable component, as its name suggests, varies from month to month. Taking an average of the variable income that he received during this period, it would appear that his average variable income is about $2,840 per month. In total, his average take-home income is about $11,242 per month.

14     The Respondent’s Notices of Assessments show that he earned an annual income of $148,754 for the Year of Assessment 2016 (for income received in 2015), $170,214 for the Year of Assessment 2017 (for income received in 2016), $184,785 for the Year of Assessment 2018 (for income received in 2017) and $188,309 for the Year of Assessment 2019 (for income received in 2018).

## Parties’ positions on the family expenses

15     It is undisputed between the parties that while parties were living together, the Respondent was the main financial provider for the family and was managing the family’s expenditure.

16     It is the Respondent’s position that he paid for the following expenses when parties were living together:

17     The above expenses do not include the Respondent’s personal expenses of $1,650, including an allowance of $700 to his parents.

18     It is the Respondent’s testimony that since he moved out of the matrimonial flat, he has continued to pay the mortgage repayment of $1,150 by way of his CPF account and the internet and cable TV charges (although it transpired at trial that the Complainant has set up a new account that she is paying for). The Respondent has also continued to deposit a sum of $500 into the child’s CDA account for payment of the child’s childcare fees (although it is the Complainant’s position that she paid for the childcare fees for July and August 2019 as she had no access to the child’s CDA account). In addition, the Respondent paid for the utility bills for April 2019 and the conservancy charges (paid in advance for a period of six months from January 2019).

19     According to the Respondent, apart from expenses, he also has liabilities to pay for. Sometime in 2017 and 2018, the Respondent suffered losses in excess of $200,000 in forex trading. His credit card debts presently stand at about $74,842 for which he allocates a monthly sum of $4,000 for payments. In addition, he has a personal bank loan to repay. The outstanding loan is about $44,736, for which he is making a monthly repayment of about $2,525. He also pays $976.64 per month towards income tax.

20     As set out at \[6\] above, the Complainant’s maintenance claim was for a total sum of $8,522. The Complainant maintained throughout these proceedings that the amount that she was claiming for was reasonable as parties enjoyed “a high standard of living” when parties were living together. Some examples she gave included overseas travel for about three times a year and eating at expensive restaurants.

21     A breakdown of the expenses declared by the Complainant (excluding the claim for monthly credit card expense in the sum of $400 per month) is set out below:

22     According to the Complainant, she has incurred new expenses after the Respondent moved out of the matrimonial flat. For example, as the Respondent had taken the family car with him when he moved out of the matrimonial flat (the car is in the Respondent’s name), the Complainant had to purchase a 10-year old car for which she has to pay a monthly sum of $448. The Respondent contended that it was not necessary for the Complainant to purchase the car as the child is in childcare from 7 am to 7 pm on weekdays and the childcare is situated at the block next to where the matrimonial flat is located. The Complainant nevertheless maintained that the car is a necessity as she finishes work at 6.30 pm and she has to pick up the child from childcare by 7 pm.

23     The other item of contention is the allowance that the Complainant gives to her parents. While it was generally accepted during cross-examination that the Complainant has been paying a sum of $800 (and not $1,000 as set out in her expenditure table) to her parents since she started work, it is the Complainant’s position that she has to pay an additional $1,000 to her parents for caregiving of the child while she is at work. The Complainant confirmed during cross-examination that this additional payment only started after the Respondent left the matrimonial flat.

24     The Complainant also pointed out that the Respondent could afford throwing a lavish wedding when he wedded his second wife, owning a Mercedes Benz car and living at an upscale residential area in Singapore with his second wife (although the Respondent maintained that he was not incurring any rental expense for this residence). Hence, it is the Complainant’s case that the Respondent is able to make the payment sought.

## My decision

25     Having considered both parties’ evidence and the submissions of the Complainant’s Counsel and the Respondent who was acting in person, I set out below my observations.

26     As observed from the Complainant’s list of expenses (and as confirmed by the Complainant at the trial of this matter), the Complainant is essentially asking for the Respondent to solely and fully bear both her expenses and the child’s, with no contribution from her. This is notwithstanding that she is gainfully employed and taking home close to $4,000 per month. I also note that the Complainant has the benefit of legal representation in these proceedings.

27     Quite apart from the monthly credit card expense of $400, the Complainant has also included in her list of expenses a monthly mortgage payment of $861, which is being paid from her CPF account. When this court sought her confirmation as to whether she was seeking for this sum to be paid by the Respondent notwithstanding that it was not an out-of-pocket expense (as it was deducted from her CPF account), the Complainant answered in the affirmative.

28     It is also noteworthy that even though the Complainant had a take-home salary of $3,970.50 a month (before she suffered a reduction in her salary in September 2019), it is her position that she spent $5,383.60 for her personal expenses alone. This amount is significantly more than her take-home salary and has not taken into account expenses she made for the child.

29     It is also apparent to this court that the Complainant’s alleged expenses have been inflated. For example, it is the Complainant’s oral testimony that she has been giving her parents $800 per month but this amount has been increased to $1,800 per month after the Respondent moved out of the matrimonial flat. The additional amount of $1,000 is purportedly for the caregiving of the child. However, it does not appear that there has been any change to the caring arrangements of the child after the Respondent moved out of the matrimonial flat. In fact, it would appear that the child spends weekdays in childcare from 7 am in the morning before the Complainant goes to work until 7 pm in the evening when the Complainant picks up the child after work.

30     I would also point out that in the course of these proceedings, there has been an overemphasis by the Complainant and her Counsel on the income level of the Respondent and what he could purportedly afford. In this regard, it is to be remembered that the financial ability of the parties is just one consideration that the court takes into account. The other equally important consideration is the applicant’s (whether it is the wife’s or the child’s) needs. An applicant’s reasonable needs do not spike just because the marriage has broken down or simply because the paying party can purportedly afford to pay more. The court has to consider the standard of living that the applicant enjoyed before there was a neglect or refusal to provide reasonable maintenance.

31     Where the maintenance of the child is concerned, I am guided by section 68 of the Women’s Charter. The duty to maintain a child rests on both parents and not one parent alone. This is especially true where both parents are either earning or capable of earning an income.

32     Having considered the evidence and adopting a broad brush approach, I am of the view that child’s reasonable monthly expenses are $1,500 per month (including the child’s school fees).

33     Considering the parties’ financial abilities and the propotion of their earning capacities, I am of the view that it is reasonable for the Respondent to bear 70% of the child’s expenses or $1,050 per month.

34     As for the Complainant’s maintenance, in light of the Complainant’s financial abillity, I am of the view that maintenance in the sum of $100 per month is sufficient to enable the Complainant to meet her reasonable needs.

35     My orders are as follows:

> i.     The Respondent shall pay the Complainant a total sum of $1,150 per month for the maintenance of the Complainant ($100) and their child ($1,050).

> ii.     The abovementioned maintenance is to be paid on or before the 15th day of each month with effect from 15 November 2019 and is to be deposited into the Complainant’s POSB bank account number xxx-xx130-6.

> iii.     As my orders were made on 18 November 2019, I have also included an order that payment for November 2019 maintenance is to be paid by 21 November 2019.

36     The Complainant has also sought a backdating of the maintenance order from March 2019. In determining whether a backdating order is appropriate, I find the case of _AJE v AJF_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGHC 115</span> at \[26\] and \[27\] instructive:

> _“26_.     _When a maintenance order is made, the operative date of the order is provided. It is usually one of the following:_

>> (_a_)     _the date from which the defendant had failed to pay proper maintenance;_

>> (_b_)     _the date of the filing of the maintenace application;_

>> (_c_)     _the date of the order;_

>> (_d_)     _the month following the date of the order._

> _27_.     _The determination of the operative date is governed by the facts of each case. If the applicant had to incur debts or sell possessions to make up for the shortfall in maintenance, that would be a strong ground for backdating the maintenance. On the other hand, if the applicant had been able to manage with the pre-order maintenance, back-payment would be a windfall, and the case for backdating would be weaker.”_

37     In the present case, the Respondent moved out of the matrimonial flat in March 2019. It is not disputed that prior to that, the Respondent bore most of the expenses of the family. These expenses were in excess of what the Respondent has been ordered to pay under my existing maintenance order. During this time, the Complainant only had to make minimal financial contributions to the day-to-day expenses of the family. Indirectly, this arrangement had allowed the Complainant to amass savings. For example, the Complainant’s Maybank account shows a balance of $47,164.61. She also has a POSB account with funds which she uses to defray her expenses. I further note that the Respondent did not cease to make payment for the family after he moved out of the matrimonial flat. He continued making provisions of $500 per month into the child’s CDA account to pay for the child’s childcare fees and paid for other items such as electricity bills (albeit only for April 2019) and conservancy charges. In the circumstances, I am of the view that a backdating order is not warranted.

38     In the interest of completeness, I would add that in the Complainant’s second affidavit, the Complainant also claimed for a reimbursement of the sum of $10,000 being the deposit payment for the car that she had bought after the Respondent moved out of the matrimonial flat. She also sought a return of the sum of $5,474.19, which is her contribution towards the purchase of the Respondent’s car. In my view, these are matters best addressed in the ancillary matters in the divorce proceedings and I have made no orders on these claims.
