Family Law – Maintenance – Child

23 November 2020

### District Judge Jason Gabriel Chiang:

1       This case involved the determination of the quantum of reasonable children maintenance and the appropriate apportionment between the mother and the father subsequent to a divorce.

## Introduction

2       In MSS 753/2020, the Complainant Mother/Ex-Wife (“**Mother**”) sought that the Respondent Father/Ex-Husband (“**Father**”) pay monthly maintenance for the 3 children of the marriage: the eldest son, aged 17 (“**Eldest Son**”); the middle son, aged 15 (“**Middle Son**”); and the youngest son, aged 12 (“**Youngest Son**”) (collectively referred to as the “**Children**”).

3       Both parties were represented by counsel. The trial was heard over 2 half-day hearings on 11 June and 20 July 2020. At the conclusion of testimony on 20 July 2020, both sides’ counsel requested for time to exchange written submissions and parties were directed to file written submissions on 11 August 2020. Having considered the evidence and the submissions, on 18 August 2020, I delivered my brief oral grounds of decision, whereby, I ordered that the Father pay to the Mother monthly children maintenance of a total of S$3,900 per month (i.e. S$1,3000 per child per month) to be paid on the 1st day of the month. I backdated this to 1 April 2020, the month in which the Father had unilaterally reduced his maintenance contributions.

4       In the circumstances, I ordered that the Father pay the arrears for the months of April to August 2020 of S$12,000 (taking into account the maintenance payments he had already made during this period), in instalments of S$1,200 per month for a period of 10 months, beginning on 1 September 2020 into the Mother’s bank account. I further ordered that the Father pay costs of S$1,000 (inclusive of disbursements).

5       On 28 August 2020, the Father being dissatisfied with my decision, filed an Appeal against my orders. The full grounds of my decision are set out below.

## Facts

### The parties

6       The Mother, Father and Children are all Singapore citizens. The Mother was 46 years old and had a monthly take-home income of about S$5,538. The Father was 45 years old and had a monthly take-home income of about S$21,216.

### Background to the dispute

7       After 17 years of marriage, the parties were divorced in Syariah Court proceedings on 6 February 2020. There were no orders on the maintenance of the Children in those proceedings, but both parties were awarded joint custody of the Children with the care and control of the Children being granted to the Mother. Subsequently on 25 February 2020, the Mother filed MSS 753/2020 for the maintenance of the Children pursuant to section 69(2) of the Women’s Charter.

8       Between September 2018 and March 2020, the Father would pay between S$4,000 to S$5,780 to the Mother for the maintenance of the Children. It is the Mother’s case that prior to September 2018, it was her who was bearing the bulk of the Children’s expenses.

9       However, in March 2020, shortly after the divorce was finalised in the Syariah Courts and the Mother had filed MSS 753/2020 on 25 February 2020, the Father informed the Mother that he would be reducing his children maintenance payments to only S$1,500 per month (i.e. S$500 per child per month) in the subsequent month.

## The parties’ cases

10     The Mother initially sought monthly maintenance of S$4,900 but at the 1st day of trial, she adjusted this sum downwards to S$4,200 (i.e. S$1,400 per child per month). The Mother argued that the average reasonable monthly expenses for the Children amounted to S$5,575.00 and sought that the Father bear 75% of such costs, which, translated to approximately S$4,200.

11     The Father acknowledged his duty to maintain the Children but argued that the reasonable and necessary expenses of the Children was only S$2.054, and that he should be paying S$1,541, which was 75% of such expenses.

12     It is noteworthy that the Father had a shift in his position on the apportionment for his share of the Children’s expenses. In the Father’s affidavit, he offered to pay S$1,624.24 of what he had then calculated as reasonable and necessary expenses of the Children of S$2,056, which works out to 79% of the Children’s expenses. At the outset of the 1st day of trial, the Father’s counsel was asked to confirm that the Father’s position on the sharing of expenses was that he was willing to bear 79% of such expenses, and this was answered in the affirmative. At the 2nd day of trial, this was further stated as what I had understood to be the Father’s position, and the Father raised no objections to this. However, subsequently in the written submissions, the Father reduced his offer for payment to S$1,541, which is 75% of what he viewed to be reasonable and necessary expenses of the Children.

## Issues to be determined

13     Section 69(2) of the Women’s Charter sets out that on due proof that a parent has neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for his child who is unable to maintain himself, the Court may order that parent to pay a monthly allowance of a lump sum for the maintenance of the child.

14     In this case, even though the Father had been provided some children maintenance of the monthly sum of S$1,500, I found that he still neglected to provide reasonable maintenance for the children, in terms of the quantum of payment. In any event, the Father did not make any submissions that this application should be dismissed and that no orders should be made.

15     Section 69(4) of the Women’s Charter provides that when ordering maintenance, the Court shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case including various factors. In this case, I determined the following factors to be pertinent:

> (a)     financial needs of the Children;

> (b)     the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources of the Mother and Father;

> (c)     the standard of living enjoyed by the Children before the parent neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the Children;

> (d)     the manner in which the Children was being, and in which the parties to the marriage expect them to be, educated or trained; and

> (e)     the conduct of each of the parties to the marriage, if the conduct is such that it would in the opinion of the court be inequitable to disregard.

16     In this regard, I agreed with the Mother’s submissions that the approach to be adopted for analysis follows the views of the District Judge in **_TAC v TAD_** **<span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 28</span>**, that had further followed the approach taken in **_BMJ v BMK_** **<span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 14</span>**, which at \[24\] highlighted the following:

> (_a_)     _Firstly, his Honour_ **_set out the total expenses of the children_** _, which comprised both_ **_the direct expenses_** _of the two children, and the_ **_‘indirect’ children’s expenses w_** _hich consisted of the proportion of the household expenses that was attributed to the children …_

> (_b_)     _Next_, **_having determined the total monthly figure for the children’s expenses, his Honour then considered the incomes of both the parents, the role of the Complainant (wife) in the day-to-day care and management of the children_**_… All these factors were taken into account in_ **_determining the respective proportions of the children’s expenses that each party should bear_**, _and hence the amount of child maintenance payable. \[emphasis added\]_

17     Following from that, I further agreed with the Mother’s submissions that the key issues to be determined for this matter were:

> (a)     what are the Children’s reasonable expenses;

> (b)     how should such expenses be apportioned given parties’ financial capacities; and

> (c)     whether the Father has sufficient financial capacity to afford such maintenance payments.

## Preliminary Procedural Issue: Admission of the Father’s SYC Affidavit

18     Before we delve into the key issues, I will address a preliminary procedural issue about the admission of the Father’s affidavit filed in Syariah Court proceedings for divorce (“**SYC**”). At the 2nd tranche of trial on 20 July 2020, the Mother’s counsel sought leave to admit the Father’s SYC Affidavit, which I allowed. I elaborate below.

19     During the Mother’s counsel’s cross-examination of the Father, he was asked what his position was on the quantum of the Children’s tuition fees. The Father replied that “_Tuition as per the Syariah, it was stated it was 400_” (see Transcripts for Day 2, 20 July 2020 at page 24, line 1), referring to the Mother’s SYC Affidavit, which had been admitted as an exhibit in the Father’s Affidavit. The Mother’s counsel then asked the Father if he had taken a position as to how much the Children’s tuition fees were in the SYC proceedings. He replied that he could not recall. On this basis, the Mother’s Counsel sought to admit the Father’s SYC Affidavit, dated 5 August 2019, into evidence, even though this was not previously admitted. The Mother had, however, exhibited 1 page of the Father’s SYC Affidavit in her affidavit in these proceedings, but this page did not address the issue of the Father’s position on the Children’s tuition fees.

20     The Father’s counsel objected to its admission on the basis that it should have been admitted at an earlier instance and that introduction of the document would prejudice the Father in terms of delaying the proceedings as he would need to take instructions on the Father’s SYC Affidavit. I clarified with the Father’s counsel that he was the same counsel representing the Father in the SYC Proceedings and had assisted in the filing of the Father’s SYC Affidavit. I further asked the Father’s counsel that in the event that I were to admit the document on the Father’s position on the Children’s Tuition expenses, whether I should only be admitting the relevant page or the whole affidavit. The Father’s counsel insisted that the whole affidavit should be included.

21     In the circumstances, while I agreed with the Father’s counsel that the Mother should have admitted this document at an earlier stage, I found the Father’s SYC Affidavit to be relevant particularly on the issue of the Children’s tuition. Additionally, the Father’s case against the Mother substantially revolved around the Mother’s purported different positions in her SYC Affidavit and her affidavit in these proceedings. Hence, it was only fair that the Court also consider his positions to determine if there were any inconsistencies. I further found that any prejudice caused by this admission could be addressed through costs, which is discussed later in this decision. In any event, given that this was the Father’s SYC affidavit and his counsel was familiar with it, I admitted the document and directed that the trial be stood down for half an hour for the Father and Father’s counsel to review the Father’s SYC Affidavit before proceeding with the Father’s further cross-examination. I found this to be fair, as the Father was afforded time to review the document and this did not result in the proceedings being unnecessarily prolonged as the trial was still able to conclude on that day.

## Issue 1: What are the Children’s Reasonable Expenses

22     The Mother claimed the total Children expenses of S$5,575 took into account 3 different components of expenses:-

> (a)     Component 1: the Children’s share of the household expenses;

> (b)     Component 2: the Children’s individual monthly expenses; and

> (c)     Component 3: the Children’s yearly expenses averaged out to a monthly sum.

### Component 1: Household Expenses

#### Food & Groceries

23     The Mother claimed that the food and groceries expenses for Children amounted to S$1,200 per month (i.e. S$400 for each child per month), whereas the Father claimed that this should only be S$420 per month (i.e. S$140 per child per month).

24     The Father argued that the only receipt provided for food and groceries was for April 2020 and that in the Mother’s SYC Affidavit, she claimed grocery expenses of S$700. The Father further alleged that the Mother then went to manufacture a grocery receipt for S$1,200 in April 2020. The Father also claimed that the groceries should be apportioned by the 5 occupants at home (i.e. the Mother, the 3 Children and the domestic helper), such that the Children’s share would only be S$420.00.

25     It is notable, that for this case, the Mother had made no claim for a sum for the Children’s eating out expenses. Hence, this was the only category of food for the Children.

26     While the Father argued that the Mother was now taking positions inconsistent to her SYC Affidavit, on inspection of the Mother’s declaration in her SYC Affidavit, she had only stated that prior to September 2018, she was paying for the household groceries of S$700. It does not state that this was all the groceries for the family. In fact, the Mother further stated that she bore half of the household, children, helper’s and holiday expenses. The Mother had explained that the sum of S$1,200 was for the 3 Children only and she had already apportioned for the sum to them for this position. Moreover, it has been 2 years since September 2018, and it is unreasonable to expect such costs to remain static.

27     I find that the Father’s position, that each of this Children only required S$140 per month for food and groceries, to be unreasonably low. That would mean that each child only has about S$4.67 a day for all their food at home and for eating out.

28     I find the Mother’s sum for groceries to be reasonable as that would equate to each child having about S$13 a day for food and groceries. For such expenses, the Court does not require all expenditure to be documented and is able to determine what is a reasonable sum.

29     In the circumstances, I allowed the Mother’s claimed sum for Food & Groceries for the 3 Children of S$1,200, as I did not find this to be unreasonable, particularly given that it is for 3 teenage boys of 12, 15 and 17 years of age.

#### Utility Charges

30     For Utility Charges, the Father claimed that the sum of household costs of S$250 should be apportioned to three-fifths (3/5) for the Children, thus amounting to S$150. The Mother claimed that the Children’s share is S$200.

31     I did not find the Father’s apportionment of three-fifths (3/5) to be fair as it took into account the domestic helper as one member of the household. The domestic helper’s share of such costs should not be factored into the apportionment as a household. Hence, I found that the household utility charges of S$250 should be apportioned as three-quarter (¾) of the stated amount of S$250, which amounted to S$187.50.

#### Domestic Helper Charges

32     Similarly, for the domestic helper, I was minded to pro-rate the Children’s share as three-quarter (¾) of the domestic helper’s fees of S$890, which was S$667.50. However, given that the Mother has requested for the lower amount of S$650, I only allowed this amount.

### Component 2: Children’s Individual Monthly Expenses

#### School Fees

33     The Father initially claimed that the Children’s School Fees were S$43 per month, whereas the Mother made no claim for any sum in this regard. The Father subsequently dropped this claimed sum in his submissions. As such, no amount was allowed for this limb.

#### Allowances

34     The Father claimed that the school allowance for the 3 Children should only amount to S$200 a month, which is about S$3.33 per child per day based on a 20 weekday a month scheme. The Father appeared to be relying on the fact that the Mother stated she paid S$300 for children allowance and transport in September 2018 in her SYC Affidavit. However, the Mother in the same SYC Affidavit claimed that this was only the amount she was paying and further that she only paid half of such sums for the Children, making the full sum S$600. Additionally, this was as of the circumstances 2 years prior in 2018.

35     Given that the 3 Children are teenagers in Primary 6, Secondary 3 and JC 1, this low sum is unreasonable.

36     I find that the Mother’s claimed sum of S$550 per month which works out to S$10 per school day for the Eldest and Middle Sons and S$7.50 per school day for the Youngest Son to be more reasonable. I also accepted the Mother’s position that such allowances are paid in cash to the Children,

37     In the circumstances, I allowed the Mother’s claimed amount of S$550.

#### Transport

38     The Father claimed that the 3 Children’s combined monthly transport costs should only amount to S$102, which would translate to S$34 per child per month. Whereas the Mother was claiming the monthly sum of S$450 for transport (i.e. S$150 per child per month).

39     It is pertinent to note that based on the Father’s SYC Affidavit, he claimed that the Children’s transport and school allowance was a total of S$1,035 per month. If we accept that the allowance was S$550 a month, that would mean the remainder for transport would be S$485 per month.

40     Be that as it may, while I find the sum of S$34 per child per month for transport to be low, I also find that the sum of S$150 per child per month to be on the higher end of the spectrum, especially when this claimed expense is not corroborated by supporting documentation and appeared to be a mere estimation.

41     In the circumstances, I reduced this claimed sum down to S$300 per month, being S$100 for each of the 3 Children’s transport per month.

#### Going Out / Gym & Toiletries, Books, Games & Miscellaneous

42     The Mother had sought S$300 for the Going Out/Gym expense and clarified that the gym expenses was for the Eldest Son and Middle Son who were using very affordable gyms run by ActiveSG. but the Father objected to this, stating that as it was a choice, it was unnecessary and a luxury.

43     The Mother also claimed that the amount of S$150 was reasonable for the Children’s monthly expenses of toiletries, books, games and miscellaneous items. The Father also objected to this as he claimed that they were a luxury.

44     I do not agree that such expenses are luxuries. These are reasonable expenses for teenage boys. In any event, both the Mother and the Father are able to afford such expenditure, and the Children are accustomed to such things. As such, I do not find it to be a luxury that parties are unable to afford. Such expenditure reflected the standard of living enjoyed by the Children before the divorce and when the Father unilaterally reduced his Children maintenance to S$1,500.

45     I did, however, find that cumulatively the sum of S$450 for these 2 limbs of expenditure was too high, particularly when there was no clear documentary evidence provided for such sums. I therefore reduced this amount to S$300 overall, i.e. S$100 per Child per month.

#### The Youngest Son’s Tennis Lessons

46     The Mother sought that the monthly sum of S$160 be accepted as reasonable expenses for the Youngest Son’s Tennis lessons. The Father objected to this as he found that there was insufficient corroborative documentation, and that in any event, it was a luxury, and not in touch with parties’ lifestyle and/or the Children’s lifestyle.

47     In this regard, I accepted the Mother’s evidence of her bank statements showing payments made for tennis lessons. I further accepted that the Mother had informed the Father of the charges for tennis lessons and that he had previously paid her sums for the Children’s expenses, including the tennis lessons without raising an objection.

48     I did not find S$160 monthly fees for tennis to be out of step with parties’ or the Children’s lifestyles, particularly given parties’ income level and the previous standard of living. In the circumstances, I allowed the sum of S$160 to be included in the Children’s reasonable expenses.

#### Clothing & Shoes

49     The Mother sought that the sum of S$300 a month be accepted as reasonable expenses for the Clothing for the 3 Children. This amounted to an amount of S$3,600 per year. The Father, on the other hand, claimed that the yearly sum should be S$1,500, hence, being the monthly sum is S$125 for 3 Children.

50     The Mother provided some receipts showing the costs of S$1,300 spent on clothes for the Children over 2 months and further attested that she would spend on clothes for the Children every few months.

51     I found the sum of S$3,600 per year, i.e. 1,200 per child per year to be excessive. However, I found the sum of S$1,500 per year, i.e. S$500 per child per year to be a bit low, given parties’ income and the fact that the Children are growing teenage boys.

52     I found that a more reasonable sum was for the amount of S$800 per child per year. This amounted to S$2,400 per year and the sum of S$200.00 per month overall.

#### Tuition

53     The next issue for consideration was the “_big-ticket_” item of tuition. The Mother sought the sum of S$1,340 to be included in the Children’s reasonable monthly expenses. The Father on the other hand claimed that the amount should only be S$400.

54     The Father argued that the Mother failed to obtain his consent for such tuition, but instead demanded the Father meet such payments. The Father further claimed that the Mother had provided insufficient evidence to support the tuition expenses and further alleged that the Mother was not able to explain the discrepancy of why tuition was initially claimed as S$1,400 instead of S$1,340, which she had subsequently revised her position to.

55     I accepted the Mother’s explanation that the 3 Children had been undergoing tuition for a long time, and that tuition had been the norm for many years even while parties were still married.

56     I also accepted the Mother’s explanation that the sum of S$1,400 reflected the sum of tuition costs at the start of 2019, when the Children were enrolled in individual tuition. However, the Mother changed this to group tuition as individual tuition was too expensive.

57     I further accepted the Mother’s evidence of her bank statements showing the payment of tuition sums. It was evidenced that for April 2020, the Middle Son’s and the Youngest Son’s tuition totaled to S$780 and that the Eldest Son’s tuition totaled to S$580. The Eldest Son had tuition for 2 subjects, the Middle Child had tuition for 1 subject and the Youngest Son had tuition for 2 subjects.

58     I also accepted the evidence that the Mother had sent text messaged to the Father on the sums claimed for the Children expenses, and the Father asked for a breakdown of such costs, which the Mother did provide, including details of the Children’s tuition. The Father did not raise objection to this and reimbursed the tuition monies together with the other expenses. While, the Father’s consent was not explicitly sought, the Father, by his conduct, had accepted such tuition fees to be reasonable at least until February 2020.

59     It is further telling that the Father stated in his SYC Affidavit his belief that the children’s monthly tuition expenses were S$1,400 and that he had been making regular maintenance payments, which included the payment for such tuition expenses.

60     As such, tuition being for the benefit of the Children, and not being out of step with their standard of living, I allowed the full sum of S$1,340, which was actually S$20 less than the actual monthly amounts being paid, given that this was the Mother’s claimed position.

### Component 3: Averaged Yearly Expenses

#### School Books & Stationery, School Uniform and Shoes

61     The Mother and the Father were in agreement that the yearly sum of S$600 was a reasonable expense for schoolbooks and stationery and the yearly sum of S$600 was a reasonable expense for school uniform and school shoes. On a monthly average that would be a sum of S$50 for each item.

62     I also took the view that this appeared to be reasonable. Given parties’ agreement on this, I allowed these amounts.

#### Dental & Medical

63     The Mother was claiming S$1,500 for yearly dental charges for all 3 Children, i.e. 500 per child per year. This worked out to S$125 per month.

64     The Mother was also claiming S$600 a year for reasonable medical expenses. This amounted to S$50 per month, and S$16.67 per child per month.

65     The Father claimed that the Mother should be held to the amount of S$500, as she had stated this amount in her SYC affidavit for both medical and dental costs. Moreover, the Father argued that the medical fees were covered by insurance.

66     It bears reiterating that on an inspection of the Mother’s SYC Affidavit, she had stated that she was paying that amount for ad-hoc annual expenses and elsewhere in the affidavit she further stated that she was only paying for half of children expenses. Hence, the annual amount in the Mother’s SYC Affidavit would at least be S$1,000.

67     The Mother stated, on the witness stand, that the amount in her SYC Affidavit was only for medical expense and she had neglected to put down dental expenses.

68     For medical expenses, the Mother explained that the insurance coverage only covered hospitalization after a certain co-pay amount and did not cover visits to the General Practitioner (GP) or specialist treatment. The Mother further explained that the Eldest Son suffered from back pain since 2019, and that his appointments were not covered by insurance.

69     The Mother had shown receipts of about S$240 for the 5 months of Jan to May 2020 in her affidavit. This amounted to an average of S$576.00 per year, which largely explained her claimed average yearly expenditure of S$600.

70     In the circumstances, I found that S$600 a year, and hence, S$50 a month, for medical expenses for the 3 Children to be reasonable.

71     For the dental expenses, the Mother claimed S$1,500 to be reasonable yearly expenses, as the Children visited the dentist twice a year as recommended. The Mother had provided receipts which added up to S$615, which was purportedly for the 1st out of the 2 yearly visits to the dentist.

72     Hence, I also found it reasonable that the Children would have to visit the dentist regularly. Given that half a year’s dentist visits amount to S$615, I only allowed S$1,230 for yearly dentist visits, which amounted to a monthly sum of S$102.50.

### Consolidated Table of Expenses

74     I now address the issue of apportionment below.

## Issue 2: Apportionment of the sharing of the Children’s reasonable expenses

75     With regard to the sharing of such reasonable expenses between the Mother and the Father, the High Court in **_TBC v TBD_** **<span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 103</span>; <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 59</span>** (“**_TBC v TBD_**”) at \[24\] cited the decision in **_XB v XC_** **<span class="citation">\[2008\] SGDC 144</span>** (“**_XB v XC_**”) that:-

> 33    It is true that parents have equal responsibility under the law over the children, in that the law does not place responsibility for financial provision solely on the shoulders of the father. In that regard, the law does not also prescribe that childrearing is to lie within the province of the mother, notwithstanding the dictates of certain cultural norms. Furthermore, **parental responsibility should be equal in that either party should be willing, able and ready to play any parenting role unless one is incapacitated for whatever reason**. If one party were thus incapacitated, the other parent should be willing, able and ready to take on the responsibility hitherto held by the incapacitated parent.

> 34    But **equality in responsibility does not necessarily suggest equality in financial contribution regardless of each parent’s financial means**.

> 35    How different parents in different families apportion their parental responsibilities and organise their finances is entirely up to them. But where the court has to make a determination on this matter on behalf of the parents who cannot agree, regard must again be had to section 68 WC, which applies equally to the father and the mother. **It clearly states that the financial provision must depend on each parent’s financial means. Where there is clear disparity in the financial means of both parents, it is only right that the courts take that into account**. From one who has more, more is naturally expected. Before the courts, parents should be required to contribute in proportion to their means. \[emphasis added\]

76     The High Court observed at \[27\] of **_TBC v TBD_** that while the starting point should be that the parents bear the financial burden equally, this is not an inflexible rule if one parent is unable to contribute equally compared to the other parent, then that parent should contribute what he or she can, and the other parent should make up the shortfall, so that the child would receive the full measure of maintenance.

77     Furthermore, Valerie Thean JC, as Her Honour was then, in **_TIT v TIU_** **and another appeal <span class="citation">\[2016\] 3 SLR 1137</span>** at \[61\] also affirmed the position in **_XB v XC_** stating:

> In this context, while the law regards both parents as equally responsible, it does not regard all parents as equally able or capable. As noted by the district judge in _XB v XC_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGDC 144</span> (at \[34\]), “equality in responsibility does not necessarily suggest equality in financial contribution regardless of each parent’s financial means”.

78     In this case, neither the Father nor the Mother sought for the Children’s reasonable expenses to be shared equally. In fact, the Father’s position had initially been that he would bear 79% of such expenses. This appears to have been derived from the fact that the Father’s monthly take-home income of S$21,216 was about 4 times that of the Mother’s take home income of S$5,538 and amounted to 79.4% of parties’ combined income. The Father, however, subsequently aligned himself with the Mother’s position on seeking that he bears 75% of such expenses.

79     Given the agreement on this apportionment and the fact that there is significant disparity in the income of the Father and the Mother, I affirmed the agreement for apportionment of the reasonable expenses of the Children for 75% to be paid by the Father and 25% to the Mother.

80     In the circumstances, given that the total of the allowed reasonable monthly expenses being S$5,140:

> (a)     On the basis of the Mother bearing 25% of the costs, she would be paying S$1,285.00 out of pocket; and

> (b)     On the basis of the Father bearing 75% of the costs, he would be paying S$3,855.00.

On a broad-brush approach and to take into account minor miscellaneous expenses which might have been missed out, I decided to round up the Father’s share by S$45 to S$3,900.00 per month for the Children maintenance, being S$1,300 for each of the 3 Children per month.

## Issue 3: The Father’s capacity to afford the maintenance payments

81     It is undisputed that the Father received a net monthly salary of S$21,216. The Father further claims that his personal expenses amounted to S$8,800 per month. Even if the Court were to accept the Father’s assertions on his expenses, wholesale, which largely comprised of bank loans which had not been substantiated in evidence, this would still avail another S$12,416 for the Father to be able to afford his contributions for the Children’s maintenance.

82     The fact that the Father alleged that he was paying the monthly sum of S$6,300 to assist a friend in clearing bank loans, showed that he has the capacity to provide for his children.

83     As stated earlier, it is notable that during the divorce proceedings in Syariah Court, the Father had been paying monthly sums of between S$4,000 and S$5,780 for the Children maintenance for the time period of September 2018 to March 2020. However, almost immediately after the divorce was pronounced on February 2020, the Father unilaterally dropped his contributions to S$1,500 a month in April 2020.

84     As the Father had only been providing S$1,500 since April 2020, the sum of S$12,000 (i.e. S$(3,900 -1,500) x 5) was owing for the last 5 months as of the Order of Court. Hence, I ordered that the Father pay this sum in instalments of S$1,200 over the next 10 months. I found this instalment amount to be reasonable given the Father’s high income and the fact that he has not presented any case of having significant personal expenses that would prevent him from making such additional payment (i.e. S$5,100 altogether for 10 months) and he had the capacity to pay such instalments.

## Costs

85     After delivering my oral grounds of decision, I requested for parties to submit on the issue of costs.

86     The Mother sought for costs to follow the event. Given that the final order was closer to her requested position, the Mother sought that costs of S$4,000 be payable by the Father to her. This comprised of S$1,500 for each of the 2 half-day trials and another S$1,000 for the decision hearing.

87     The Father sought for the Court to make no order as to costs, given that her initial request was for S$4,900, which she then dropped to S$4,200, but I had ordered the maintenance payments of S$3,900, which was a lesser sum. The Father further raised issues of the late admission of the Father’s SYC Affidavit by the Mother in trial and that much cross-examination had focused on the Mother’s purported failure to produce documents, prevarications and contradictions.

88     In this regard, I agreed with the Mother that costs should follow the event. In this case, the Mother’s initial position was monthly maintenance of S$4,900, as opposed to the Father’s amended claim of about S$1,500. Moreover, the Mother voluntarily lowered her request to S$4,200 at the start of trial. In this regard, the Mother does appear to have been substantially more successful than the Father even though she was not completely successful in her claims.

89     It is notable that majority of the time spent at the trial was for the Father’s cross-examination of the Mother, as this took up more than half a day’s trial time. A substantial portion of such cross-examination was for the purposes of clarifications, but also a significant portion of the cross-examination were on issues that were eventually decided in favour of the Mother.

90     I, however, took the Father’s Counsel’s point about when the Mother had sought to introduce the Father’s SYC Affidavit only when the Mother’s Counsel had begun cross-examination of the Father.

91     As stated above, I found the admission to be relevant given that the Father had taken issue with the Mother’s current position as opposed to what the Mother had stated in her SYC Affidavit and the Mother intended to cross-examine the Father on his position in his SYC Affidavit, where he had accepted certain purported expenses for the Children. Thus, the Mother would have known the dispute that the Father had with the tuition and other sums from his affidavit in these proceedings and would have known that she may need to rely on the Father’s SYC Affidavit. Therefore, she could have admitted this document at a much earlier time. Moreover, the Mother had been invited to inform the Court whether she was seeking leave to admit the document at the start of the hearing, but she did not give any such indication.

92     In the circumstances, balancing these factors and that this matter had been heard over 2 half-days of trial each party had submitted 1 affidavit and some further documents and also had 1 set of closing submissions, I ordered that the Father pay costs of S$1,000 (inclusive of disbursements) to the Mother.

## Conclusion

93     In the circumstances, I made the following orders for this case:

> (a)     the Father is to pay the Mother a total of S$3,900 per month as maintenance for the Eldest Son, the Middle Son and the Youngest Son (i.e. S$1,300 per child per month);

> (b)     the aforesaid maintenance is to be paid by the Father to the Mother on the 1st day of the month with effect from 1 April 2020 (which is a date after the filing of this application);

> (c)     additionally, the Father is to pay to the Mother a total of S$12,000 being the arrears in Children maintenance for the months of April to August 2020, in instalments of S$1,200 per month for a period of 10 months, on the 1st day of the month beginning 1 September 2020, into the Mother’s bank account; and

> (d)     the Father is to pay to the Mother the fixed costs of S$1,000.

94     This effectively meant that the Father was directed to make his 1st payment of monthly Children maintenance of S$3,900 and the arrears instalment payment of S$1,200 (i.e. total of S$5,100) on 1 September 2020. This was explained to the Father.
