19 June 2020

### District Judge Sheik Mustafa:

## Introduction

1       In these grounds, I will refer to the Plaintiff as “the father”, to the Defendant as “the mother”, and to the child as “A”.

2       The father commenced an originating summons against the mother requesting to be granted sole custody, care and control of their mutual child A, with supervised access to the mother. The mother disagreed. After hearing both sides, I made the following orders-

> a.     Both the father and the mother shall have joint custody of A,

> b.     Both the father and the mother shall share care and control of A on alternate weeks as follows –

>> i.       Commencing Sunday 14 June 2020, the mother shall have care and control of A from 11.00am on Sunday through to 11.00am the following Sunday, including overnight in that period, and on every alternate week thereafter, as well as during the first half of school holidays, including overnight in the period. The father shall not supervise or attempt to interfere with the mother’s care and control of A during these periods. The father shall also be responsible to ensure that none of his family members shall supervise or attempt to interfere with the mother’s care and control of A during this period. The father shall be allowed to have access to A for dinner every Tuesday and Thursday from 6.30pm to 8pm during these periods.

>> ii.       Commencing from Sunday 21 June 2020, the father shall have care and control of A on the other alternate weeks from 11.00am on Sunday through to 11.00am the following Sunday, including overnight in that period, as well as during the second half of school holidays, including overnight in the period. The mother shall not supervise or attempt to interfere with the father’s care and control of A during these periods. The mother shall be allowed to have access to A for dinner every Tuesday and Thursday from 6.30pm to 8pm during these periods.

> c.     The father shall send the child to the mother at the commencement of the mother’s care and control, and the mother shall send A to the father at the conclusion of the mother’s care and control. The handover and collection of A shall take place in the void decks or ground floor of the respective buildings that they reside in, or at any other places expressly agreed to by both parties. It shall be the responsibility of the parent handing over to ensure that A is handed over on time at the correct location.

> d.     The father, shall not by himself, his agents or his servants, bring A out of Singapore without the prior written consent of the mother, or an Order of Court.

> e.     The mother, shall not by herself, her agents or her servants, bring A out of Singapore without the prior written consent of the father, or an Order of Court.

> f.     The father, the mother, and A shall receive counselling by an agency appointed by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF).

> g.     There shall be liberty to apply.

> h.     There is no order on costs.

3       The father appeals against the judgment. I now give my reasons for it.

## Applicable Legal Principles

4       The primary law defining the custody care and control of children is found in section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act –

> **“3**.    Where in any proceedings before any court the custody or upbringing of an infant or the administration of any property belonging to or held in trust for an infant or the application of the income thereof is in question, the court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration and save in so far as such welfare otherwise requires the father of an infant shall not be deemed to have any right superior to that of the mother in respect of such custody, administration or application nor shall the mother be deemed to have any claim superior to that of the father.”

5       The law defining custody of children is succinctly described by the Court of Appeal in the case of _CX v. CY_[^1], that –

> “For the development of the law of custody, we deem it necessary to lay down a general definition detailing the scope of each order. Our observation is that in most custody cases, parties are simply concerned over which parent has care and control and access. Parties labour under the mistaken impression that if they are denied custody, they will be unable to see their child anymore and will lose all contact with the child. We regret to say that some family law practitioners further muddy the waters by failing to advise their clients adequately as to what “custody orders” actually entail. If parties are assured of their respective rights to care and control and access, we foresee lesser tension and acrimony in disputes over custody issues.

> Adopting this narrow definition of “custody”, it appears that there will be relatively few occasions where significant and longer-term decisions need to be made for the child. Hence, parties will seldom need to come together to make a joint decision even if joint or no custody orders were granted. We should add that it is an almost impossible task for us to lay down an exhaustive list of matters which will fall under the concept of residual custody. The line is not always clear as to what matters would be considered the important and longer-term decisions concerning the upbringing and welfare of a child. It suffices to say that decisions pertaining to religion, education and major healthcare issues would fall into such a category.

> In this day and age, we feel that the preferable position in the law of custody is that advocated by the father, ie, to preserve the concept of joint parental responsibility, even if the parties may harbour some acrimony towards each other. Often, advocates of the _Helen Ho_ position rely on the acrimonious relationship of the parties to argue that joint custody will be detrimental to the welfare of the child. However, they fail to appreciate the fact that some degree of acrimony is to be expected when parties are undergoing the stresses of a marital breakdown. As allegations of wrongdoings and breaches of fidelity can be hurtful, the time when the marriage breaks down may not be the best time to assess whether both parents can co-operate for the rest of the child’s life. We believe that the fear that parties cannot co-operate may be overstated. It is a quantum leap in logic to assume that the parties’ inability to co-operate during the period of divorce or custody proceedings equates to an inability to agree on the future long-term interests of the child.

> …

> Adopting the view that joint or no custody orders should be granted unless there are exceptional circumstances, we were of the opinion that the judge was not plainly wrong in granting joint custody, notwithstanding the allegations and counter-allegations made by each party.”

6       In _ZO v. ZP_[^2], the Court of Appeal added as follows:

> “… The input by both parents furnishes a balance that enhances the development of that child (or those children, as the case may be) until adulthood is reached. In contrast, the exclusion of one of the parents in this particular regard would – absent an exceptional reason – contribute towards a less balanced as well as less rounded development of the child (or children) concerned. Hence, the pronouncement made by the court in CX v CY that a joint (or no) custody order would henceforth be the norm rather than the exception. We could not agree more.”

7       Regarding the issue of whether a parent’s access to a child ought to be supervised, it was held in _APE v APF_[^3] –

> “ I am therefore of the view that unsupervised access should be awarded, unless the following exceptional circumstances are present:

>> (a)    there are serious welfare concerns regarding the non-custodial parent such as violence or inappropriate parenting if the child were left unattended with the non-custodial parent;

>> (b)    on an examination of the state of the relationship between the non-custodial parent and the child before the commencement of the divorce proceedings and after the commencement of the divorce proceedings, it is found that the child has been estranged from the non-custodial parent such that the parental-child relationship is in need of serious repair (for instance, if the child is fearful in meeting the non-custodial parent); or

>> (c)    factors exist such that it is difficult for unsupervised access to be effectively implemented (eg, where the relationship between both parents is so acrimonious that the custodial parent frustrates the effectiveness of unsupervised access orders and unsupervised access is not possible without detriment to the child).”

## Facts

8       A is a 7-year old child trapped in a gyre of parental litigation.

9       A’s parents are Singapore citizens. They both immigrated from India. The father’s parents also live in Singapore. The father is an IT project manager, and he works on contract basis. The mother self-describes as part-time homemaker.

10     After the birth of A, the mother returned to her family in India with A. Although he was not employed at the time, the father did not accompany them. In India, the mother was diagnosed with post-natal depression, and she underwent treatment for it. The father claims that he had wished to visit the mother and A there, but there was a falling out with his parents in law, who threatened to call the police on him. He did not go, and in any event, he claims, he had just started a new job.

11     A and the mother remained in India for almost 11 months. They returned to Singapore in February 2014. The father’s parents moved into their flat.

12     The mother gradually recovered from her depression. By August 2014, she was up and about, and conducted cooking sessions. She even took part in a television contest on Channel 8 called “Neighbourhood Chef” in which she was a finalist.

13     In March 2015, in the presence of the mother and of A, the father slashed his wrist with a kitchen knife, and was arrested for attempted suicide.

14     In August 2019, the trio went on a trip to the River Safari. All appeared to be well. 3 days later, the father collected A from his school, during school hours, without the mother’s knowledge. On the same day, the mother was served with the summons for the present case. The father came to the home and took his and A’s belongings and left.

15     The Child Protection Service was called. Nothing of concern transpired from there.

16     OSG 137/2019 presented itself initially as an application by the father for custody care and control of A, with supervised access to the mother. Amongst other things, the father’s request for sole custody of A is primarily premised on the following–

> a.     The mother has a mobile phone addiction,

> b.     The mother suffers from post-natal depression,

> c.     The mother suffers from other undiagnosed personality disorders.

17     At the same time, the father also requested for interim custody of A.

18     A few weeks into the proceedings, an interim order was issued that the mother is not to take A out of school, for both parents not to remove A from jurisdiction, for the mother to have supervised access on Saturday and Sunday for 3 hours at a venue of her choice, and that the mother has liberty to call A during weekdays outside school hours.

19     The mother subsequently counter-applied for interim custody of A. In November 2019, the principal case and both interim cross-applications came for hearing before me. The mother was not represented, but the father’s lawyer appeared on his behalf. The father’s counsel had just filed written submissions and had not served it on the mother. In spite of this, the father’s counsel insisted to proceed with the hearing. I directed for a copy of the submissions to be given to the mother immediately, and stood down the hearing to give her time to peruse the submissions and prepare her response to them.

20     The hearing resumed. The father’s counsel submitted that the mother has psychiatric issues and urged that I order the mother to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. Counsel also suggested that I interview the 7-year old A, and requested an order that the child be prevented from leaving Singapore. The mother countered that there is no basis for her to be subjected to a psychiatric evaluation, and that, if anything, the father ought to be examined instead in view of his suicide attempt in the presence of A. She submitted that she is the subject of marital abuse. She also claimed that the father had failed to give her the access in spite of the interim order, or placed undue restrictions on it.

21     I declined to interview A, and called for a custody evaluation to be done, and for a report to be submitted to me directly. I adjourned the hearing to a date to be fixed, and ordered the interim order to continue in the meantime.

22     Whilst waiting for the report, the mother filed a summons to vary the interim order. She alleged that she had not been able to access A in spite of the interim order. The father filed a detailed affidavit purporting to rebut her allegations.

23     I received the custody evaluation report. Unfortunately, by then the nation was afflicted with the Coronavirus Pandemic, and the ensuing Circuit Breaker measures prevented an immediate resumption of hearing without the consent of both parties. The mother was agreeable to a hearing using Zoom, claiming that she had been deprived of access, but the father’s counsel declined to give consent. The hearing was thus set on a date immediately after the conclusion of the Circuit Breaker period.

24     At that hearing, which was conducted using Zoom, I made the orders that I stated above. At the same time, I dealt with the prayers of the mother’s latest summons, as well as her earlier summons for interim custody, as a whole in the order that I made, as they became subsumed therein.

## Findings

25     I find that the parents do not have a good relationship at all. There is an evident breakdown of trust and of all trace of goodwill. This is an important part of my consideration of how A will be cared for in the future. After all, after the court case concludes, it will be the parents who will have to carry out the responsibility of parenting A. They share such deep hostility towards each other, and this must be taken into account in considering the best arrangements for A. I find that the prognosis of good joint parenting is poor. However, I find that there is a reasonable prognosis of parallel parenting instead.

26     I find that there is no reason for the mother’s access to A to be supervised by the father. There is no evidence that A was ever at any time in danger of violence or inappropriate parenting from either parent. The instances of violence, even if true, were directed between the parents and not at A. There stands no personal protection orders issued against any party.

27     I find the father’s gatekeeping behaviour to evidence an intent at retaining control of A to the exclusion of the mother. Although under the terms of the interim order the mother was to have 3 hours of access supervised by the father, he overzealously policed the period, to the extent that he took objection to the mother making a telephone call to her own mother and letting A speak to her. He saw this as harm caused to A.

28     I also find that the father has methodically involved A in the dispute between the father and the mother.

29     I rejected that the father’s claim that the mother will abduct the child if left unsupervised. There is no evidence to support this belief.

30     I will address the issue of the mother’s mental condition. The father’s allegation against her is that she suffers from a mobile phone addiction, post-natal depression and “other personality disorders”, which remain unspecified.

31     I find that the father has failed to show how the mother is addicted to mobile phones to the extent that she is incapable of normal parenting functions. He attempts to illustrate this by pointing out the incident during access where the mother’s friend cut up A’s fruits for him whilst the mother was using her mobile phone. The father’s counsel tried to relate this fact to the facts in the case of AZB v AZC[^4], but the facts of that case are miles apart in difference from the present one. I find that this incident is trivial and does not prove anything, let alone the mother’s inability to care for A.

32     The father highlights the mother’s tardiness and unpunctuality, but I find that these do not amount to an extent that can be regarded as affecting the care of A. On the other hand, I find that the father’s use of A to monitor the lengths of the mother’s delays in picking him up unnecessarily exposed A to the parental conflict. This is in itself not in A’s best interest.

33     Regarding the mother’s post-natal depression, she had obtained treatment for it. I also I bear in mind that she was afflicted 6 years ago. Based on the evidence, she appears to have led a normal life thereafter. Besides that, there is no other indication that she is mentally unsound to such an extent that she is incapable of caring for herself, or of A. A person is presumed to be of sound mind unless proven otherwise. The legal burden of proving that the mother is of unsound mind lies on the father. He has not discharged that burden.

34     In any event, the mother is self-aware of her condition, and this generates confidence in her parental capabilities. As recently as in August 2019 she was seen by a doctor at a polyclinic and there appears to be no indications of depression or any other issues of concern. In the face of this medical observation, there is no substratum of evidence upon which I ought to draw any adverse inference against the mother’s mental condition.

35     The father’s descriptions of the mother’s behaviour during the instances of access, even if true, amount to expressions of anger and frustration, which ought to be seen in the context of her not getting access to her child without the father’s intrusion.

36     On the other hand, of concern is the father’s own act of violent self-injury viz, slitting his wrist with a kitchen knife, in the presence of A. compared to the mother’s post-natal depression, this act took place very recently, in 2015. The father dismisses this as a trivial matter. It is not. Such an act of violence by one in charge of a young child is a matter of great concern. He has not demonstrated that he has received adequate treatment for it. He has not exhibited adequate self-awareness of it. However to his credit, I take into account that the father resides with his parents who appear to be adequate caregivers of A.

37     Based on the evidence presented to me, as well as taking into account the confidential report of the custody evaluators, I find that both parents possess adequate parenting capacities.

38     Counsel for the father pressed that I ought to interview A. To recap, A is 7 years old. According to the father, he is a bright and mature child. Counsel relies on the case of _AZB V AZC_[^5]_._ In that case, the High Court encouraged the interview of children caught in the custody dispute of that case. This is a restatement of judicial pragmatism, as the children were the very persons whose care were the subject matter of the dispute before the court. However, there are logical limits to the application of this exercise. Section 125(2) of the Women’s Charter states –

> (2)    In deciding in whose custody a child should be placed, the paramount consideration shall be the best interest of the child and subject to this, the court shall have regard –

>> (a)    to the wishes of the parents of the child; and

>> (b)    to the wishes of the child, where he or she is of an age to express an independent opinion.

39     The critical question is whether a child in question is able to express not just an opinion, but also an independent one. Clearly, the legislature was aware of the high likelihood of young children parroting an opinion drilled into them by one parent over the other.

40     The Court in AZB v AZC decided to interview the children. They were 13 and 11 years old. In the present case, A is a mere 7 years old. He has just started primary school. He is not able to go to school independently. According to the father, A is easily traumatised and frightened by his mother’s outbursts. Although the father maintains that A is mature enough, this is a bald assertion. There is no evidence at all to show that A is indeed mature enough to understand the nature of a court proceeding, let alone the consequences of a custody care and control order on him. The risk of relying on the views of a child of tender years is implicitly cautioned in section 120 of the Evidence Act –

> **120**.    All persons shall be competent to testify unless the court considers that they are prevented from understanding the questions put to them or from giving rational answers to those questions by tender years.

41     As a result, I find that any views given by A _in a judicial interview alone_ cannot be reliable due to his tender age. A is not capable of expressing an independent opinion at his age. It would also unnecessarily involve him in this litigation. In any case, A was interviewed by the custody evaluators and they reported their observations to the Court. They did this not only by way of face-to-face interview of A, but also by way of observing his interactions with his parents. Based on the reported responses, my conclusion is that A is not capable of independent opinion.

42     In any event, I find that there is no reason or need for me to interview A. In my view, the facts I needed in order to arrive at a just and fair decision are obtainable from the two parties themselves, the parents and brother of the father, and the custody evaluators. The latter have, in turn, obtained information from other significant persons, such as A’s school, childcare, and others.

## Issues

43     Having stated the law and found the facts above, I examined the issues of the case –

> a.     Should the father be granted sole custody, care and control of A?

> b.     If so, what would be a suitable arrangement for the mother to have access to A?

> c.     Should the mother’s access to A be supervised by the mother?

> d.     If the father should not be granted sole custody, care and control of A, what other arrangement should it be?

## Principles Applied and Judgment

44     Based on the foregoing findings, and applying the facts to the applicable principles of law, I found that the following.

45     There is no reason for the custody of A to be granted solely to the father to the exclusion of the mother. Joint custody of a child of both parents is simultaneously an inherent duty of parents and a right of a child imposed by virtue of law and accrued by virtue of biology, and ought not be removed unless good grounds are shown that not to do so would be against the best interest of the child. I find that there are no such grounds in this case. There is nothing exceptional in the circumstances of this case that warrants a departure from joint custody. Therefore, I order that A is to remain in the joint custody of both parents. I find that to do so is in the best interest of A.

46     I find that the parents ought to share care and control of A between them, instead of only one parent having it. The parents are living separately in different households, so they are physically living apart. A is not too young to live in two homes. A had been continuously in the primary care of the mother since his birth until about the time these proceedings commenced. It is not in the child’s best interest to have his care and removed from one of his parents simply because both of them do not get along with each other to the extent that even access arrangements are hotly contested. There is no indication that the mother has not been able to care and control A adequately. Therefore, I order A to be placed in the care and control of both parents on an alternating week basis. I find it to be in A’s best interest and welfare.

47     I am also satisfied, based on the reports of the custody evaluators, that the parents are able to parent A in parallel to each other.

48     I also find that an arrangement where the father has care and control, but for the mother to only have access, will not in A’s best interests in the long run. The father’s attitude and behaviour evinces that he intends ultimately to remove the mother from A’s life. To ensure that A continues to receive her right of parenting from his mother, a shared access arrangement ensures a balance to each parent in preventing such alienation from happening further.

49     To address the issue of possible removal of A from Singapore, I forbade both parents from bringing A out of jurisdiction without the consent of each other, or with the court’s permission.

50     I am aware that shared care and control is usually more amenable for children of pre-school age. The rigours of school schedules complicate logistics and arrangements, and so tend to mitigate against it. However, the facts of the present case are not that of a typical one. The interest of A to have a smooth weekly schedule is offset by the danger of A being alienated from the mother in the long run.

## Conclusion

51     I am mindful that A’s parents have an embittered relationship. This spills over into their relationship with A. It is also evident that the spousal hostility has not bypassed A. Sadly, he has been triangulated by both parents. There is likely to be no single arrangement regarding A which will satiate both of them. However, this court is not here to propitiate parents; its duty is to do what it thinks is best for A. My order is a best attempt to draw a line for them as regards their relationship to their child, in the hope that whatever their spousal differences are, their parental roles vis-à-vis the child are now distinct, structured, settled and predictable. In other words, the parents have to adult up.

52     This, in my judgment, is the best thing for A in the circumstances. To this end, I adopt the recommendation of the custody evaluators and order that the parties obtain professional counselling assistance by an agency appointed by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF). I hope that with the proper professional assistance, both parents will be able to acquire sufficient ability to co-parent for the best interest of A.
