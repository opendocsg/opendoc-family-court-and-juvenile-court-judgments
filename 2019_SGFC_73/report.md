Family Law – Child Maintenance – Variation

5 July 2019

### District Judge Azmin Jailani:

## Introduction

1       SUM 831/2019 (“SUM 831”) was an application by the plaintiff-mother against the defendant-father for an upward variation in the quantum of child maintenance previously ordered in an interim judgment dated 24 March 2009 (the “IJ”). The increase sought was from $300 to $500.

2       Whilst not the subject of any appeal, parties also appeared before me at the time for SUM 4419/2018 (“SUM 4419”). SUM 4419 was the defendant’s _earlier_ application to remove the provision in the IJ which provided for spousal maintenance. Notably, the amount ordered in the IJ for spousal maintenance was $200.

3       At all material times and for the purposes of these proceedings, the defendant was acting in person. On the other hand, the plaintiff was represented by her counsel, Mr David Liew.

4       As highlighted earlier, the defendant first commenced SUM 4419 on 13 December 2018. The plaintiff, on the other hand, only commenced SUM 831 on 8 March 2019, 1 week before the scheduled hearing of SUM 4419. I will touch on the procedural history of both applications and my observations on the same in greater detail below.

5       On 15 March 2019, parties appeared before me to present their respective cases. After reviewing parties’ evidence and submissions, I gave my decision on 18 March 2019, and provided brief reasons for the same.

6       In essence, I granted the defendant’s application in SUM 4419, and dismissed the plaintiff’s application in SUM 831. Dissatisfied, the plaintiff filed HCF/DCA 33/2019 appealing my dismissal of SUM 831 _only_.

7       Against that backdrop, I now provide the full grounds of my decision.

8       I would pause at this juncture and highlight that the manner in which both proceedings had unfolded invariably resulted in certain overlap insofar as parties’ evidence conceivably traversed both SUM 4419 and SUM 831. The upshot of this was that certain contentions relied on for SUM 4419 may be applicable to SUM 831. However, as I mentioned earlier, the defendant _did not_ appeal against my decision in SUM 4419.

9       In other words, SUM 4419 is _not_ the subject matter of these grounds.

10     That said, and insofar as it would be useful to briefly highlight the documents and evidence filed in SUM 4419 and the decision therein _in the context_ of the present appeal for SUM 831, such matters have been stated herein. However, insofar as the plaintiff may conceivably seek to criticize this court’s decision in SUM 4419 (be it in support of this present appeal or otherwise), that, in my view, would be procedurally and legally improper, and quintessentially a backdoor appeal. More importantly, as I noted earlier, such critique falls outside the boundaries of the present appeal, and I say no more on the matter.

11     For all intents and purposes, the plaintiff’s present appeal is to be viewed on the basis of there being no disturbance of the findings reached in SUM 4419.

## Background

### Parties and the terms of the IJ

12     Parties were married on xx xxx 2005. The child of the marriage (the “Child”) was born some time in December 2005. IJ was granted on xx xxx 2009. At the time of IJ, the Child was a little over 3 years old.

13     The salient terms of the IJ were as follows:

3(c)  The Defendant shall pay a monthly sum of S$200.00 for the maintenance of the Plaintiff. The Defendant shall pay the monthly maintenance into the Plaintiff’s POSB Account no. XXXXXXXXX on the 3rd day of each month commencing 3rd December 2008.

3(d)  The Defendant shall pay a monthly sum of S$300.00 for the maintenance of the child. The Defendant shall pay monthly maintenance into the Plaintiff’s POSB Account no. XXXXXXXXX on the 3rd day of each month commencing 3rd December 2008.

14     As regards the aforementioned provisions, parties diverged insofar as the defendant asserted that the maintenance orders were made by consent.[^1] The plaintiff disputes this.[^2] I was inclined to accept that plaintiff’s position. A review of the plain terms of the IJ did not suggest that the maintenance orders were consent orders.

15     Putting that aside, what was more pertinent to my mind was that the IJ _made a clear distinction between spousal maintenance and child maintenance_. On the plaintiff’s own narrative that the orders were not consent orders, the necessary conclusion was that the court had duly considered and specifically allocated the defendant’s liability for spousal and child maintenance. In other words, the court made an assessment on the defendant’s contribution for the plaintiff’s and the child’s maintenance _respectively and separately_.

16     I make this observation at this juncture to provide the _legal_ nature of those maintenance orders vis-à-vis the plaintiff’s narrative on how she personally utilised those monies. I will touch more on this in the subsequent sections below.

### Documents filed by Parties

### Procedural history

19     I now turn to the procedural history of these proceedings.

20     On 13 December 2018, the defendant commenced SUM 4419. Concurrently, the defendant filed his supporting affidavit for the application.[^3] At a case conference on 10 January 2019, directions were given for the plaintiff to file her reply affidavit for SUM 4419. The plaintiff did so on 31 January 2019[^4].

21     As directed at the same case conference, the defendant filed his final reply affidavit on 21 February 2019[^5].

22     At a further case conference on 26 February 2019, the plaintiff specifically sought leave to file a further response to the defendant’s final reply affidavit, specifically contentions regarding her expenses and that of the Child. By the defendant’s consent and pursuant to the court’s directions at that case conference, leave was granted to the plaintiff to a further reply _limited_ to the issues I stated above.

23     The plaintiff was directed to file such affidavit by 5 March 2019. At that same case conference, the hearing for SUM 4419 was fixed for 15 March 2019.

24     On 8 March 2019 (3 days _after_ the deadline directed by the court), the plaintiff filed what appeared to be her further reply[^6]. However, it was only at that stage that the plaintiff filed the summons for SUM 831. In doing so, the plaintiff expressly stated in the summons that the affidavit in support of this newly commenced application was _the further reply affidavit_ (i.e., P2). Put another way, the plaintiff’s further reply to SUM 4491 (which was granted on a limited basis) had now manifested itself into becoming the supporting affidavit for a freshly initiated SUM 831.

25     This was something which fell outside the scope of the directions given at the case conference of 26 February 2019.

26     Moreover, at the hearing on 15 March 2019, it was brought to my attention that the summons for SUM 831 and P2 were only served on the defendant on 10 March 2019,[^7] 5 days _before the hearing of SUM 4419_.

27     In summary, not only did the defendant receive the plaintiff’s affidavit late (in breach of the directions at the case conference of 26 February 2019), he found himself at the receiving end of a fresh application at the doorstep of the hearing of his own application.

28     Given the circumstances, the plaintiff sought the court’s leave for both applications to be heard together.

29     Prior to the hearing on 15 March 2019, I directed the plaintiff to provide a consolidated bundle for both proceedings. I had also preliminarily fixed both applications to be heard together to hear parties’ position on the conduct of both applications.

30     At the hearing on 15 March 2019, and after hearing parties, I granted Mr Liew’s request for both matters to be heard together, and proceeded with the substantive hearing. This was principally due to the defendant’s express intimation that he did not wish to exercise his right to file any further affidavits for SUM, and was prepared to proceed with the hearing of both matters.

## Parties’ respective cases in brief

31     I now set out parties’ respective cases.

### Plaintiff’s case to increase the quantum of child maintenance in SUM 831

32     The plaintiff’s case for SUM 831 can be encapsulated in the following paragraphs of P2 (being the affidavit in support of SUM 831):

5.    Firstly, I have in my reply Affidavit of 31st January 2019, _in effect_ prayed for order in terms of my cross-application to vary \[Clause 3(d) of the IJ\] to increase the Defendant’s contribution towards the maintenance of our son, YYYY, from $300.00 to $500.00 per month _with effect from the date that the Defendant seeks in his application, in the event that he succeeds in his application to set aside \[Clause 3(c) of the IJ\] therein that he was to contribute $200.00 per month towards my maintenance_.

6.    I have just filed my cross application together with this reply Affidavit.

7.    There is a significant change in my circumstances and that of our son which prompted me to file in this application. _The very fact that the Defendant now seeks to vary \[Clause 3(c) of the IJ\] to cease his contribution towards my maintenance at $200.00 per month is in itself a significant change to my circumstances if allowed.[^8]_

(emphasis added)

33     On the plaintiff’s own affidavit, it was essentially her case that the Defendant’s application in SUM 4419 (a variation of spousal maintenance), if allowed, necessitated _a corresponding_ increase in child’s maintenance in SUM 831. In other words, the _quid pro quo_ for granting the defendant’s application in SUM 4419 was to grant SUM 831. Furthermore, the increase in child maintenance ought to mirror the decrease in spousal maintenance.

34     When viewed in this manner, SUM 831 was essentially filed to reverse the effect of SUM 4419, and was a contingent application predicated on the outcome of SUM 4419.

35     To provide the plaintiff’s case some context:

(a)     Since IJ was granted, it was the plaintiff’s contention that she has had to bear the heavier burden for the child’s expenses[^9]. Notwithstanding this, the plaintiff expressly acknowledged that she chose not to make any application to seek an upwards variation of the maintenance sums orders despite her contention of there being an increase in expenses since the IJ (i.e., 10 years).

(b)     In other words, the plaintiff _chose to accept the status quo_. Again, this was despite her acceptance that the defendant’s contribution of $300 for child maintenance was “simply insufficient”.[^10]

(c)     Against this backdrop, the plaintiff contended that she was actually using the $200 provided by the defendant under the IJ for spousal maintenance for the child.[^11] Put another way, the plaintiff had _chosen_ to treat the _entire_ sum of $500 which the defendant provided was practically used for the child’s maintenance.

(d)     On that basis, the plaintiff was prepared to let sleeping dogs lie insofar as the would receive the $500 from the defendant.

(e)     However, when presented with SUM 4419, there was a possibility (which materialised) that the plaintiff would be deprived of the full $500. In those circumstances, perhaps to formally crystallise what she had practically been doing, she commenced SUM 831.

(f)     Indeed, the plaintiff’s motivations for SUM 831 was clear where she expressly took the position that the granting of SUM 4419 was “it itself a significant change”[^12] to her circumstances.

36     In further support of her application, the plaintiff sought to contend that the passing of time after IJ as justifying an increase given that “there was no increase in maintenance for 10 years”[^13], there was a “clear and material change to the circumstances \[to the Child’s\] needs…”[^14], and “there \[was\] a clear basis for and merit to \[her\] application now to obtain a _higher_ contribution from the Defendant.”[^15] (emphasis added)

37     The remainder of the plaintiff’s case was devoted to objecting to the defendant’s bases for the relief sought in SUM 4419. These relate to the change in the defendant’s financial circumstances and the plaintiff’s own financial circumstances. As I mentioned earlier, it is against this backdrop where it would be necessary to highlight the contentions raised by the defendant in SUM 4419.

### The defendant’s case

38     The defendant’s narrative can be summarised as follows:

(a)     Since the IJ, the defendant remarried in April 2011 (approximately 2 years after IJ). The defendant presently has 3 children in this new marriage. At the time of the application[^16], the children were 7 years, 4 years, and 9 days old respectively.[^17]

(b)     While it appeared that the defendant was able to sustain the maintenance orders in the IJ when the first two children were born, the arrival of the defendant’s 3rd child from the new marriage was such that he could no longer make ends meet.[^18]

(c)     In this regard, the financial impact of the newborn child was two-fold – (1) first, it resulted in the wife having to leave her job to become a homemaker,[^19] and (2) second, because of the newborn, the defendant had to reduce the number of tenants in his house from 1 to 2 tenants,[^20] which resulted in lower rental income.

(d)     In light of the loss of the wife’s employment and the reduction of his passive rental income, the defendant’s expenses now exceeded his income.

(e)     Separately, the defendant asserted that the plaintiff was 5 years his junior (and therefore be in a better position to further improve her financial circumstances)[^21], purportedly had better earning capacity than the defendant, and had relatively less liabilities than the defendant.[^22] Against that backdrop, the defendant asserted that he was no longer in a position to sustain the payment of _spousal maintenance_. In closing, the defendant sought to impress this Court that he had already provided maintenance for over 9 years,[^23] and that he “\[has his\] children now, and need\[ed\] to have sufficient money to be able to afford to pay for \[their\] expenses.”[^24]

(f)     It was clear that the defendant did not wish to pay spousal maintenance. The defendant was _equally clear_ to state that he would “still continue to pay maintenance towards my child from the first marriage. \[His\] main priority is to provide for all children up to what \[he could\] afford reasonably.”[^25]

39     In response, the plaintiff made the following contentions:

(a)     At the outset, the plaintiff questioned the true extent of the defendant’s financial circumstances, particularly his new wife’s income prior to being a homemaker.[^26] In respect of his newborn child, she contended that having more mouths to feed “d\[id\] not necessar\[ily\] mean that it \[was\] a material change in circumstances...”[^27]

(b)     The plaintiff also refuted the defendant’s assertions that she was earning a better income than him.[^28] That said, the plaintiff did highlight on affidavit that she was supplementing her income by renting two rooms in her HDB flat,[^29] but did not state the amount she was receiving. It was only when I questioned Mr Liew at the hearing did the plaintiff provide such pertinent details.[^30]

40     It would be useful to pause here and note that on parties’ own stated incomes:

(a)     the defendant has a take-home income of approximately $3,350 (nett salary of $2,800 + $550 rental income); and

(b)     the plaintiff had a take-home income of $4,190 (nett salary of $2,640 + $1,550).

41     It was also apposite to mention at this juncture that the plaintiff was effectively managing the affairs of 2 people (i.e., herself and the Child), whilst the defendant was managing the affairs of 6 people (i.e., himself, his new wife, the 3 children of the current marriage, and the Child)

## The law on variation of child maintenance

42     There is no dispute that the relevant statutory provisions dealing with the variation of child maintenance orders applicable to the present case is sections 127 read with 72 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353). It is also fairly trite that at the heart of any application to vary a maintenance order for children is the following:

(a)     First, the comparison between the facts present at the time when the original maintenance order was made with the facts now facing the court at the variation proceedings, and whether such facts were sufficiently “material” or constituted “good cause” to justify the variation sought.

(b)     Second, the financial needs of the child, and to ensure that the welfare of the child, being of paramount importance, was not affected by any variation (of lack thereof) of the maintenance.

(c)     Flowing from the second point is that any maintenance order must, invariably, have regard to the payer’s financial capability. As much as the welfare of the child ought to be preserved, if the payer is unable to shoulder the full (or his/her equal share of the) burden of the child’s financial needs, any order or maintenance cannot be such so as to effectively debilitate the payer from conducting his/her own affairs.

(d)     Lastly, the analysis of all these factors is a holistic and fact-sensitive exercise to be applied to the facts of each case before the Court.

43     Amidst all these considerations, the overarching consideration, in my view, is the reasonableness of parties’ positions. In my analysis of some of the contentions raised in these proceedings, it appeared to me that, parties have lost sight of the reasonableness of the submissions they fervently push. There was a lack of realisation of how their contentions would stand _if the shoe was on the other foot_.

44     Against that brief recap of the applicable legal principles, I turn to my findings.

## Analysis and my findings

45     Before addressing the substantive issues in the plaintiff’s application, I found it appropriate to first deal with two preliminary matters which arose in these proceedings.

### Preliminary observation (1) – Manner in which the plaintiff sought to introduce SUM 831

46     The first relates to manner in which the plaintiff had sought to introduce SUM 831 into the proceedings.

47     To recap, as stated at \[22\] to \[27\] above, the plaintiff, _without any notice_ to the defendant, served the summons for SUM 831 and the supporting affidavit 5 days before the hearing of SUM 4419. At the case conference of 26 February 2019 (when the hearing for SUM 4419 was fixed), _no mention_ was made regarding the plaintiff initiating a fresh application. The only direction given was for leave for the plaintiff to file a further reply affidavit for SUM 4419 on limited issues.

48     Instead, the limited issues affidavit transformed itself into a supporting affidavit for a completely new application.

49     At the hearing on 15 March 2019, I queried Mr Liew on why SUM 831 was commenced at such a late juncture, specifically _after_ SUM 4419 had been fixed for hearing. I was also surprised that the application was only served on the defendant 5 days before the hearing, with the supporting affidavit (or rather, what supposed to be the limited issues reply affidavit) served 5 days late.

50     In response, Mr Liew sought to contend that the essence of the plaintiff’s prayers for SUM 831 was already encapsulated in her first affidavit replying to SUM 4419. The summons for SUM 831, if anything, was simply to ‘regularise’ this prayer.[^31] In this regard:

(a)     In her first affidavit (which was, for all intents and purposes, the reply affidavit to the defendant’s supporting affidavit for SUM 4419), the defendant stated as follows:

28.    In the premises, I pray that my application to vary the said Interim Judgment to have the maintenance of $200.00 per month that the Defendant is to pay me, to be paid for the maintenance of our son to increase his contribution to the maintenance of our son from $300.00 to $500.00 per month, with effect from the date that he seeks in his application.[^32]

(b)     At the time the plaintiff filed this first affidavit on 31 January 2019, she _had not_ filed the summons for SUM 831. Accordingly, there was no “application” for the defendant to speak of.

(c)     In her second affidavit (i.e., the late affidavit which was intended to be limited to specific issues in SUM 4419, but ended up being the supporting affidavit for SUM 831), the defendant stated the following:

5.    Firstly, I have in my reply Affidavit of 31st January 2019, in effect prayed for order in terms of my cross-application to vary \[Clause 3(d) of the IJ\] to increase the Defendant’s contribution towards the maintenance of our son, YYYY, from $300.00 to $500.00 per month with effect from the date that the Defendant seeks in his application, in the event that he succeeds in his application to set aside \[Clause 3(c) of the IJ\] therein that he was to contribute $200.00 per month towards my maintenance.

6.    I have just filed my cross application together with this reply Affidavit.[^33]

(d)     Concurrent with the filing of the second affidavit on 8 March 2019, the plaintiff filed the summons for SUM 831. These documents were only served on the defendant 2 days later, and 5 days before the hearing of SUM 4419.

51     It was first necessary to rationalise Mr Liew’s submission. In this regard:

(a)     As far as the plaintiff was concerned, the ‘prayer’ made in her first affidavit somehow _initiated legal proceedings_ insofar as there was now appeared to be a new application to determine the plaintiff’s application to increase the Child’s maintenance.

(b)     To the plaintiff’s mind, she had effectively initiated or placed all and sundry on notice of her application.

(c)     When the summons for SUM 831 was eventually filed, it would take place retrospectively insofar as it gave effect to the ‘prayer’ highlighted in the plaintiff’s first affidavit.

(d)     This must be the case given that the plaintiff sought to assert that she had, in her first affidavit, “in effect”[^34] made such prayers, and that the summons for SUM 831, _which came more than a month later_, was meant to formalise this.

52     After considering the matter, I had difficulty accepting Mr Liew’s arguments:

(a)     At the outset, any traction which Mr Liew sought to gain would first have to be premised on the position that a supporting affidavit, _in itself_, could somehow be an originating process by which legal proceedings could be initiated. Only then would there be some justification or basis in relying on the ‘prayer’ inserted by the plaintiff in her first affidavit.

(b)     Only then could it be said that proper notice was brought to defendant (and necessarily the court) of such an application being adjudicated. Put another way, it was necessary for the plaintiff to elevate the status of the ‘prayer’ in her first affidavit to something more than a comment. It had to have some _legal significance_. This must be the case if the actual summons for SUM 831 was merely to formalise or regularise what was highlighted in the first affidavit.

(c)     Such an approach, in my view, is plainly wrong, and in any case a proposition which was not supported by any authority.

(d)     As noted in _Principles of Civil Procedure_ (Pinsler SC, 2013 Academy Publishing) (at page 82), it is well-established that “\[t\]he originating process is _the means_ by which legal proceedings are initiated.” _(emphasis added_). Indeed, an entire Part 2 of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (S 813/2014) is dedicated to setting out how proceedings are commenced. This is separate from other provisions within the Family Justice Rules which provide for the manner in which an application may be made.

(e)     To the best of my knowledge, there is no provision which provides for the commencement of any proceedings in the manner purported to be done by the plaintiff in this case.

(f)     In my view, SUM 831 _could never_ have been initiated by virtue of the ‘prayer’ in the plaintiff’s first affidavit. Similarly, the mere reference to such a ‘prayer’ does not initiate a proceeding (or give notice of the initiating of such proceeding) which the defendant _was required or expected_ to formally take cognizance of.

(g)     The upshot of this was that SUM 831 could only have been properly initiated _at the time the summons was filed_, and could never have ‘regularised’ the plaintiff’s first affidavit. It necessarily followed that until the summons for SUM 831 was served on his, the defendant was never expected to have to deal with (much less be expected to have notice of) any other application _apart from SUM 4419_. This was precisely approach taken by the court in all case conferences leading up to the hearing.

(h)     Even if I was wrong on this, the contents of the summons itself contradicts the plaintiff’s position. This is because the _only_ affidavit in support of the plaintiff’s application, _as stated in the summons itself_, was the plaintiff’s second affidavit (i.e., P2).

53     Separately, at the hearing on 15 May 2019, Mr Liew mentioned that the issue of SUM 813 was raised at the case conferences preceding the hearing of SUM 4419.

54     However, this was _not_ evident from the court’s records.

55     As I mentioned earlier, the main issues raised at the case conference was the plaintiff’s application for leave to file a further affidavit in response to the defendant’s reply affidavit _in respect of SUM 4419_. Indeed, if the plaintiff had truly raised the issue of SUM 813 (and any justification why she was delayed in filing the formal application, be it time, cost, or otherwise), this would have been a subject for discussion at the case conference. There was nothing preventing the plaintiff, in the case conferences leading up to the hearing of SUM 4419, to have made clear the intended separate application, such that the necessary directions could be made to manage the same.

56     If there was truly the issue of a _new application being initiated_, I have my doubts that a hearing date would have been fixed at the case conference on 26 February 2019.

57     At the material time, there was _nothing_ to suggest that the plaintiff had real limitations to bring the application to the court’s attention, _even if the summons had not been filed yet_. Instead, much like the plaintiff’s conduct _prior to_ the commencement of SUM 4419, the plaintiff was content on keeping silent.

58     The plaintiff cannot have it both ways – it cannot purport to have provided notice of the application (relying on such tangential notice) on one hand, but at the same time choose to keep its cards close to its chest and not make any mention of it during the case conferences, assuming that everyone else understood the plaintiff’s motives and intentions. The way I see it, the plaintiff kept her cards so close to her chest that neither the defendant nor the court was aware she had any cards in the first place.

59     A final point which Mr Liew raised at the hearing was that there would effectively be no prejudice to the defendant because the factual matrix and reliefs sought in both applications were related and similar to each other. In other words, it could not be said that the defendant was caught completely off-guard with the _potential_ of SUM 813.

60     With regard to this contention, I would make the following observations:

(a)     At first blush, Mr Liew’s contention was not wholly unattractive. As I highlighted earlier, the plaintiff had painted the narrative, in resisting SUM 4419, that she was _practically_ using the $200 provided for in the IJ for spousal maintenance for the Child. This intermingling of facts and contentions _in respect of both spousal and child maintenance_ was such that it was not incomprehensible to argue that the plaintiff _may have_ commenced an application to increase child maintenance.

(b)     Put another way, the manner in which the plaintiff had intermingled the maintenance sums had put the supposed co-relation between spousal maintenance and child maintenance ‘in play’. The issue was ‘in play’ such that it could not be said that the defendant was completely caught off guard with the delayed and eventual commencement of SUM 831.

(c)     In my view, the _prospect_ of an application, without more, cannot amount to an expectation of a respondent to operate on the basis that such an application _would actually be made_. Unless and until legal proceedings are _actually_ commenced (in the manner and form prescribed), a potential respondent is entitled to operate on the basis that no such application is before the court. Framed in the opposite perspective, a complainant cannot expect to justify a delay in actually commencing an action on the basis that passing reference was made to its potential commencement, and that the respondent ought to have expected the same.

(d)     Separately, while the reliefs sought in SUM 4419 and SUM 831 may be related or similar, I was of the view that each application dealt with a completely different subject matter, and would be predicated on similar, _but not identical_, legal and factual considerations. In SUM 4419, the issue before the court was spousal maintenance. In SUM 831, the issue was on child maintenance. While viewed from on the overarching perspective of a variation application, each form of maintenance has its own unique factual and legal issues. Put another way, what might applicable to issues concerning spousal maintenance may not be wholly applicable to child maintenance.

(e)     Again, unless and until a formal application is initiated in the proper form, no respondent is expected to pre-empt or expect to prepare its case for an application which _was never in existence at the material time_. That would demand some clairvoyance on the part of a respondent.

(f)     To my mind, natural justice and procedural fairness does not just entail the vague premise of an anticipating potential application, it demands that all parties (including the court) are _properly placed_ on notice of a properly defined, initiated, and articulated case to be met.

61     It is at this point where I question whether the plaintiff would be advocating this position _if the shoe was on the other foot_:

(a)     Would the plaintiff have been as forgiving if she was the party on the receiving end of a late affidavit which went beyond the scope of the directions made at a preceding case conference? How would the plaintiff have reacted when instead of receiving an affidavit, she received a last-minute application (which could have been raised much earlier) at the doorstep of the hearing of his own application?

(b)     Would the plaintiff have been as magnanimous as the defendant to have waived her right to a reply affidavit for SUM 831 (which the defendant essentially did, despite his entitlement to file a such a reply affidavit)[^35] when served with a belated application less than 5 days before the hearing of SUM 4419?

(c)     Would the plaintiff have accepted the contention that she ought to have known about or expected SUM 831 (and prepared herself for the same) by virtue of a throwaway line in an affidavit purporting to a make a ‘prayer’ of relief? Additionally, would the plaintiff accept that the ‘prayer’ constitutes sufficient notice of an impending application which was made _more than a month later_. [^36]

(d)     Would the plaintiff have taken a more laidback approach if the defendant kept mum about the intention to raise a completely fresh application at all the case conferences, only to serve the application less than a week before the hearing of SUM 4419, and be expected to be in a position to go ahead with both matters immediately?

62     While I note that this issue was ultimately moot given the defendant’s stance on the matter, I found this case a useful reminder to parties (especially those represented by counsel) to adopt the adage of doing unto others what they would have others do unto them, with the converse equally true. It was somewhat regrettable that during the proceedings, the posture taken by Mr Liew was not one which suggested any reflection of the plaintiff’s approach, but instead, a technical (and unsubstantiated) justification of the same.

63     I also found it appropriate to restate the observations made by the Court of Appeal in _Goh Seng Heng v Liberty Sky Investments Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 1113</span> (at \[62\]) against acting like “assassins” in contentious proceedings, and to come to the court with clean hands.

### Preliminary observation (2) – parties’ non-disclosures

64     The next preliminary issue dealt with, in my view, certain non-disclosures made by _both_ the defendant and the plaintiff.

#### Non-disclosure by the defendant

65     I turn first to the defendant.

66     When setting out his financial circumstances, the defendant made the following contentions:

7.    My wife is _currently_ a homemaker and she has to take care of the children, especially our newborn baby. Due to our high expenses and my unaffordability, we aren’t able to hire a domestic helper.

8.    My expenses have increased over the years after I married again in 2011.

9.    As such, it must be pointed out that there has been a material change in circumstances since \[the IJ\] was granted, and I humbly pray that the Plaintiff’s maintenance be stopped from what has been ordered to me under \[the IJ\] as I am findings it very hard to make ends meet, especially after the birth of my youngest child on December 2018.

…

11.    My take home pay is about $2800 per month. I also rent out a common room of my HDB flat for $550 monthly. However, it is barely sufficient to take care of my family and pay for the maintenance towards the Plaintiff.

67     Based on the defendant’s own affidavit above, I queried on the phrase “currently” with regard to the wife’s employment status. It was only after I queried the defendant that the following matters were brought to my attention:[^37]

(a)     Before being a homemaker, the defendant’s current wife was previously working as a croupier. As a croupier, she was drawing a take-home salary of approximately $1,800.

(b)     Before the arrival of the new-born baby, the defendant was able to rent 2 rooms (as compared to the present case where he was only able to rent just 1 room based on HDB’s housing policy).

68     On the basis that the defendant was earning the same passive income with both rooms in his HDB flat, the defendant’s financial capacity would have been as follows:

(a)     $2,800 nett salary;

(b)     $550 (using an approximate figure of 30% of the wife’s salary on the basis that that was being used to pay for the family’s expenses); and

(c)     $1,100 (rental of two rooms at $550 per room).

69     This works out to be approximately $4,450 per month, somewhat similar to the plaintiff’s _presently_ declared income.

70     Separately, I also queried on the decision for the defendant’s current wife to stop working. Whilst not being on affidavit, it was submitted by the defendant at the hearing[^38] that:

(a)     Before the arrival of the newborn, the defendant’s family situation allowed for the defendant to comply with the maintenance order. This was because of the additional income earned by the family from their respective permanent jobs.

(b)     Given that the defendant and his current wife were working, the latter’s aunt was involved in the taking care of the child. This was going reasonably well at the start. However, it was only recently that the defendant and his wife noticed issues with the first two children’s performance whilst they were under the aunt’s care. The defendant further contended that the relationship with the aunt was strained on the basis that the latter kept asking for monetary loan from the defendant and/or his current wife.

(c)     In those circumstances, the plaintiff and his wife collectively decided for the wife to leave her job to focus on taking care of the children.

71     At the hearing, I asked the defendant why these specific details were not included. The defendant’s candid answer was that he was “not good with the law”[^39]

72     After consideration the matter, and whilst I appreciated that the defendant was acting in person, I was not able to wholly accept the defendant’s reasoning. Given that it was the defendant’s application in SUM 4419, the onus was on him to give complete and proper disclosure of his financial capacity. Setting out a narrative has less to do with the law, and more with setting out the facts. A lot of what the defendant stated at the hearing could have been included in his affidavit. This would have allowed for factual issues to be properly crystallised. Moreover, an appreciation of the defendant’s overall family’s financial situation as stated above would have provided a better picture of the defendant’s financial cycles. More importantly, it would have addressed a specific objection raised by the plaintiff[^40] of the lack of particulars with the defendant’s wife’s employment status _before and after_ the decision to stop work.

#### Non-disclosure by the plaintiff

73     I next turn to the plaintiff.

74     A review of the plaintiff’s first affidavit makes _no mention_ of any passive income she was earning to supplement her existing job (where she was drawing a nett salary of approximately $2,640).

75     It was only when the defendant raised certain issues with the plaintiff’s bank/transaction statements and income where the plaintiff _only_ made the point that she supplemented her income by renting out two rooms.[^41] Even then, the plaintiff provided _no particulars_ on the _amount of rent she was receiving_. The only discernible evidence regarding the plaintiff’s rental income was in the _defendant’s second affidavit_[^42] where he highlighted the rental income which the plaintiff appeared to be receiving.

76     It must be borne in mind that by the defendant’s first affidavit, the issue of the fact and extent of rental income (as raised in the defendant’s first affidavit) was already in play.

77     When queried, Mr Liew’s initial submission was to state that particulars were provided.[^43] When no such particulars were pointed out to him, Mr Liew candidly acknowledged that this particular was inadvertently omitted as he was in a rush to prepare the plaintiff’s second affidavit.[^44] While I found this submission odd given that the precise issue of the plaintiff’s rental income was made an issue by the defendant and specifically highlighted in the plaintiff’s second affidavit, I was prepared to give Mr Liew the benefit of doubt.

78     In summary, I was of the view that _both_ the plaintiff and defendant did not make proper disclosure of facts which were clearly relevant for the determination of _both_ SUM 4419 and SUM 831. I was also of the view that the facts which this court eventually obtained from parties were not outside the reasonable scope of information ordinarily provided in such variation applications.

79     Be that as it may, I was not inclined to draw an adverse inference in the sense that notwithstanding the lack of disclosure, and given that parties were able to provide direct evidence (albeit not on affidavit) on the queries I raised, I was prepared to accept such evidence provided orally before me. Such an approach would be consistent with the scope of the judge-led approach, particularly Rule 22(3)(c) of the Family Justice Rules. That said, I accorded it the appropriate weight against the totality of the evidence submitted before me.

### Was there a material change which justified the variation sought by the Plaintiff?

80     Against the backdrop of all those observations, I now turn to the substantive contentions raised in connection with the plaintiff’s application.

#### Whether SUM 4419 in itself constitute a material change of circumstances

81     To recap, the plaintiff’s core argument in support of her application (as highlighted at \[32\] above) was that the mere fact that the defendant commenced (and eventually succeeded) SUM 4419 was, “in itself”[^45] a material change in the plaintiff’s circumstances.

82     I found difficulties with this argument for the following reasons:

(a)     First, the plaintiff provided no authority how the commencement and/or success of an application _for variation of spousal maintenance_ was, “in itself” a material change which warranted _a variation of child maintenance_.

(b)     Second, as I highlighted earlier, the reason why the plaintiff essentially commenced SUM 831 was to preserve the status quo where she practically treated the $200 she received as spousal maintenance under the IJ as being for the benefit of the Child. Put another way, SUM 831 was her way of preserving _how_ she treated both maintenance orders.

(c)     However, the fact remains that the IJ made a clear and conceptual distinction between spousal maintenance and child maintenance. Both maintenance orders, in a manner of speaking, operate independently of each other. As I had highlighted earlier, the _qui pro quo_ for the reduction in spousal maintenance could not, in itself, result in an increase, _much less a corresponding increase_, of child maintenance to a sum equivalent to the reduction of spousal maintenance.

83     In the manner framed by the plaintiff, there was no basis for there to be an increase in the sum of child maintenance simply because the defendant commenced and was successful in SUM 4419. On that basis alone, the plaintiff’s application would naturally fail.

84     However, for completeness, the court would need to consider, independently, whether the order for child maintenance ought to increase, if at all, and if so, the quantum of the same.

#### Child’s expenses

85     In terms of the change of the child’s expenses since the IJ, I note that the plaintiff provided no comparative breakdown on the list of expenses when IJ was granted and the present time. There was, effectively _no change_ to speak of.

86     That said, I was inclined to accept that in all likelihood, 9 years after IJ, with all else being equal, there was a change in the child’s expenses. To this end, the plaintiff did present her calculation of the child’s expenses:[^46]

87     In his reply affidavit[^50], the defendant challenged the entirety of the expenses listed by the plaintiff. To this end, the defendant only valued the reasonable expenses of the child at $436.[^51] When viewed in this light, the defendant’s current contribution of $300 is approximately 70% of such expenses.

88     Adopting the broad approach espoused by the High Court in _UEB v UEC_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHCF 5</span> (at \[13\]), I was prepared to accept the majority of the expenses listed by the plaintiff in her table of expenses, save that I made the following adjustments:

(a)     First, while _UEB_ was clear that the law did not require every specific item of expense to be proved by receipts, more exceptional expenses required the necessary evidence. In the present case, I was of the view that the child’s tuition expense was one of them. This was particularly so given that tuition comprised of _almost half_ the Child’s expenses (on the plaintiff’s figures). Again, putting the shoe on the other foot, would the plaintiff have accepted the defendant’s bare statement that almost half of the child’s expenses was spent on something which was not properly documented? It may not prevent the plaintiff from making the claim, but to expect the contention to go unchallenged is a different matter completely.

(b)     Notwithstanding the lack of supporting documents, what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, as the defendant himself provided no supporting evidence for tuition for his elder child.[^52] Accordingly, I only considered it reasonable to remove 1 item out of the 3 tuition expenses highlighted by the plaintiff.

(c)     Second, I made some moderate adjustments to the Child’s clothing expenses. I was of the view that $100 a month (i.e., $1,200 a year) was slightly on the higher end.

(d)     Third, the plaintiff valued joint food and groceries to be $700 (i.e., $350 for the child and plaintiff). I was more inclined to accept the defendant’s valuation of $300[^53] to be more reasonable.

89     After making the necessary adjustments, I valued the Child’s expenses to be $1,041.

#### Parties’ financial circumstances, and reasonable apportionment of child maintenance.

90     After determining what I considered to be the child’s reasonable expenses, the next issue to be considered was the appropriate apportionment to allocate to each party. The corollary to this was whether the variation sought by the plaintiff was justifiable in the circumstances.

91     In terms of parental responsibility, it is trite that both parents have shared responsibility over the children. This much is clear in _inter alia_ section 68 of the Women’s Charter. The real question is the _extent_ of that responsibility.

92     On the issue of finances, it is also well-established that shared responsibility _does not_ equate to equality in financial contribution (see _XB v XC_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGDC 144</span>; _TIT v TIU and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHCF 8</span>). The apportionment of financial responsibility must have regard to parties’ respective financial capabilities/liabilities.

93     I deal with defendant first:

(a)     Without encroaching into SUM 4419, the crux of the plaintiff’s case was that his current finances made it unworkable for him to continue spousal maintenance. Tangential to this was that he could not afford to pay _more_ than what was required of him under the IJ for child maintenance.

(b)     In terms of his income, I was prepared to accept the defendant’s aggregate income of $3,350 (i.e., $2,800 + $5,50). Given that the plaintiff was not substantively disputing the items of expenses listed by the defendant, I was prepared to accept the same (i.e., $3,351.90)[^54]. In other words, his overall expense was on par with his income.

(c)     With regard to the defendant’s newborn, I was prepared to accept that this new addition to the family _was a material change_ in that it would increase the financial burden to his family. I was not prepared to accept the plaintiff’s contention that this new addition did not have a real impact on the defendant’s finances. In my view, a common sense approach must be taken. Every new member to a family, whilst a blessing, is undeniably a significant responsibility. The financial impact of a new member cannot be denied. Such impact would, to my mind, only conceivably be softened or possibility negated if the financial ability of the defendant was so huge such that this responsibility would not have a material impact to his life.

(d)     This was not the case here.

(e)     That being said, I was mindful of the point made by the Court of Appeal in _AYM v AYL_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 559</span>, where the court observed (at \[47\]) that fresh obligations from a new family should not compromise _pre-existing obligations_ owed to the previous family. In this connection, I was also mindful of the comments made in _Law and Practice of Family Law in Singapore_ (Foo Siew Fong gen ed, Sweet & Maxwell Asia, 2016)(“_Law and Practice_”)(at \[7.4.28\]) regarding the competing considerations between existing maintenance orders and the ability for parties to move on with their new lives:

On one hand, the husband would have been aware of his maintenance obligations when choosing to remarry and start a new family, and it would be his responsibility to ensure that this does not adversely impact his ex-wife and children. Yet, a maintenance order _should not be a shackle around the lives of divorced parties, and the law should allow parties to have a fresh start in their lives, remarry and have new children_. The courts will have to take a common sense approach in each case, having due regard to the needs and financial resources of parties and all children.

(emphasis added)

(f)     Taking those two propositions together, I was of the view that at the very least, the defendant should not be allowed to provide a sum _lower than what the IJ provided for in_ respect of the Child.

(g)     Associated with the defendant’s own income is that of his current wife. As I highlighted earlier, the defendant’s current wife was earning a decent income. Had she continued working, this could have eased the defendant’s overall burden, and conceivably allow the defendant to pay more child maintenance.

(h)     In this regard, the defendant’s direct evidence was that there was a decision for the wife to stop working. This was on account of the elder children’s school performance, and issues with the caretake aunt. The defendant also contended that the wife would have to stay anyway to take care of the newborn.

(i)     At the outset, I would pause here and accept that the loss of the wife’s income was a material change. This was _not_ a situation in other cases where the current wife consistently did not work from the time of IJ to the present, the fact of which would not amount to a change in circumstances.

(j)     On this point, Mr Liew’s submission[^55] was that the decision for the wife to stop working was an act of self-inducement to the plaintiff’s and the child’s detriment. While attractive on its face, I was not inclined to accept this contention. Family dynamics and decisions are never straightforward. It is always easy to critique a decision from a distance, but due regard must be had to appreciating whether the decision was a hard choice to make, or one sufficiently inexplicable or imprudent which would give rise to the inference that it was made more out of design than circumstance.

(k)     In the present case, I was prepared to accept that the defendant’s decision for the current wife to stay home, albeit lacking in detail, was not made with any meaningful view to shy away from his responsibilities of child maintenance under the IJ. This much was clear in his own affidavit where he expressly reaffirmed his obligation to comply with the maintenance order for the Child. I was also prepared to accept that the decision for the current wife to stop working was made to prioritize family over money, and was not made with a view of sabotaging the plaintiff. If at all, the defendant would have been cognizant of how this would affect the family’s overall situation.

94     Turning to the plaintiff, on the evidence presented before the court, the plaintiff’s income was slightly higher than the defendant’s (i.e., $4,190 vs. $3,300). Further, compared to the defendant, the plaintiff did not have the same number of dependents under her. For the income they both generated, the plaintiff had 2 mouths to feeds, whilst the defendant had 5.

95     When viewed in this light, and without penalising the plaintiff for making significant strides in trying to make ends meet and to provide for the child, the plaintiff was is a _comparatively better financial situation_ as compared to the defendant.

96     On that basis, the present circumstances were such that I was not inclined to _further increase_ the defendant’s pre-existing obligation for child maintenance as provided for in the IJ. I was inclined to _maintain the status quo_ of his obligations at the present time. Before concluding, I noted in my brief decisions whether this status quo ought to be temporary.[^56] In this regard, I considered whether I should place a hard deadline such that the defendant’s current wife goes back to work and supplements the family’s income so that the defendant could provide _more_ maintenance to the Child.

97     After considering the matter, I was not prepared to impose a hard deadline on the parties. First, there was nothing before me to suggest that any gains from the wife’s return to the workforce was sufficient to offset the direct and/or indirect cost of leaving the children in infant/childcare. Second, and perhaps to the plaintiff’s benefit, I was not inclined to hamstring parties and determine, at this stage, that $500 child maintenance were to apply moving forward simply because children’s expenses fluctuate. Setting the bar at this stage might do more harm than good.

## Conclusion

98     For the following reasons, I dismissed SUM 831.

99     Given that the plaintiff was not successful, the defendant was in person, and to reduce any further acrimony between parties, I did not make any costs orders.

100    In closing, and as I highlighted to parties when I gave my decision, it was my hope that the plaintiff did not come out of these proceedings feeling as though she was penalised for (a) not having another family, (b) being open to explore options to improve her finances (i.e., renting two rooms to supplement income), and (c) adopting a more passive approach of seeking an increase in child maintenance earlier. However, on the material placed before me, I was not persuaded that I was to _further increase_ the defendant’s specific liability for child maintenance.

[^48]: While it is noted that the plaintiff has two tenants, the proportion of the household expenses stated in the plaintiff’s affidavit were divided equally between the plaintiff and the child. This is on the assumption that the rental would conceivably have covered the tenant’s utilities.

[^49]: In the plaintiff’s table, reference was made to “insurance for family”. A perusal of the supporting documents (P1 at pages 55 to 57) indicate that the insurance policies purchased was for the plaintiff, and not specifically for the child.
