Family law – Ancillary matters – Division of matrimonial assets

11 February 2021

### District Judge Darryl Soh:

## Introduction

1       This matter concerns ancillary reliefs arising from divorce proceedings between the Plaintiff-Wife (“Wife”) and the Defendant-Husband (“Husband”) (collectively referred to as the “Parties”). The Parties reached an agreement for their children’s care arrangements prior to the hearing for ancillary reliefs. What remained to be adjudicated were the division of matrimonial assets and the children’s maintenance. Orders were made on these ancillary reliefs on 29 October 2020. The Husband has filed an appeal against my decision on the division of matrimonial assets. In these grounds, I explain that decision in detail.

## Background Facts

2       The Parties were married in January 2006 and they are in their mid-40s. The Husband is an educator and the Wife is a therapist. Three children were born to the marriage. The Parties had different parenting styles and could not agree on approaches to child management and discipline. These differences led to an irretrievable breakdown of the marriage. The Wife commenced divorce proceedings on 9 November 2018 and the Husband filed a counterclaim on 26 April 2019. There was significant acrimony between the Parties, with both contesting the respective cases made against them. Separately, both Parties filed applications for personal protection orders against each other in 2018.[^1] I dismissed the Parties’ applications for personal protection orders on 31 October 2019 after a full trial.

3       Thereafter, credit to the Parties, they managed to find it in themselves to mitigate the acrimony for the sake of their children and they proceeded on an uncontested basis for both the claim and counterclaim in the divorce proceedings. Their marriage was dissolved on account that both behaved in a way that the opposing party cannot be reasonably be expected to live with the other party. In addition, the Parties also agreed on the children’s care arrangements. They agreed to joint custody of the children, with the Husband being granted sole care and control. The Wife remained significantly involved in the children’s care as she had liberal access to them. The Parties also divided special occasions and holidays between each other which they could spend with the children. Interim Judgment on the dissolution of the marriage was granted and the agreed orders on the children’s care arrangements were recorded on 28 January 2020.

## Issues in Dispute and Orders Made

4       The residual ancillary reliefs that necessitated adjudication were the division of matrimonial assets and the children’s maintenance. After hearing the Parties’ evidence and submissions, I arrived at my decision that the net value of the pool of matrimonial assets for division was **$2,279,549.59** and I ordered the pool to be divided in the ratio of **47.03:52.97** in the Husband’s favour. The Parties subsequently agreed on the distribution of matrimonial assets to meet the division ratio and separately sought to record consent orders for other specific assets.

5       The Husband has appealed against my decisions on the net value of the pool of matrimonial assets, the division ratio, and the matrimonial liabilities to be deducted from the pool of matrimonial assets prior to division. I now elaborate on the grounds on my decisions on these issues in turn.

## Division of Matrimonial Assets

### Pool of Matrimonial Assets

#### Uncontested Matrimonial Assets

6       Counsel for both Parties diligently worked together ahead of the hearing to identify matrimonial assets that were not in dispute – these assets were agreed to be matrimonial assets and there were no disputes on their respective values to be ascribed. Counsel deserved substantial credit for their efforts as they significantly narrowed down the matters in dispute and identified the specific issues that required adjudication.

7       The gross value of the pool of matrimonial assets that were _uncontested_ stood at **$3,008,912.16**:

#### Disputed Matrimonial Assets

##### (1)   Joint POSB Account ending 5466 and the Wife’s POSB Account ending 8806

8       The Parties were on common ground that their joint POSB Account ending 5466 and the Wife’s POSB Account ending 8806 were matrimonial assets but they could not agree on the values to be ascribed to both assets. The difference in their views arose from the operative date to value those assets. The Wife’s counsel submitted that it should be the balances closest to the hearing of the ancillary matters. The Husband’s counsel submitted that it should be the balances closest to the date of Interim Judgment.

9       I agreed with the Husband’s counsel. In _TDT v TDS and another appeal and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 145</span> at \[50\], the Court of Appeal confirmed that the default operative date for the valuation of matrimonial assets is the date of the first ancillary matters hearing, although the court retains the discretion to depart from this date where it is warranted by the facts. I exercised that discretion to adopt valuations that were closest to the date of Interim Judgment because of the nature of the two assets in question. If Parties withdrew funds out of the respective bank accounts after the Interim Judgment, they do so on their separate accord and it should not prejudice the value of the matrimonial assets to be determined by the court. If Parties are of the view that transactions after the Interim Judgment date ought to be considered, they are at liberty to make that submission but that is a separate exercise altogether. As such, I ascribed a value of $3,155.34 for their joint POSB Account ending 5466 and $3,432.62 for the Wife’s POSB Account ending 8806.

##### (2)   The Wife’s CIMB Fixed Deposit Account ending 0535 and the Husband’s SGX Account ending 4081

10     While the Parties could agree on the values to be ascribed for the Wife’s CIMB Fixed Deposit Account ending 0535 ($207,455.27) and the Husband’s SGX Account ending 4081 ($78,692.29), they could not agree on whether those assets were matrimonial assets. The common underlying dispute for both assets was the source of funds that led to the acquisition of those assets. The Husband submitted that both were not matrimonial assets since the funds can be traced back to an investment property gifted to him from his father. The Wife submitted that both were matrimonial assets since the moneys found therein were acquired during the marriage or were commingled with matrimonial funds. I agreed with the Wife that the moneys found in both accounts were matrimonial assets.

11     According to the Husband, he acquired a substantial sum of money from the sale of an investment property located in Balmoral Crescent towards the end of 2010. This property was acquired by his father and was gifted to him prior to the marriage. The Husband received net sale proceeds of about $443,000.00 which he claimed had been kept in his POSB bank account. The Husband claimed that the sale proceeds eventually found its way to the Wife’s CIMB Fixed Account and the Husband’s SGX account.

12     I first turn to the Wife’s CIMB Fixed Account. Of the sale proceeds received, the Husband claimed that he withdrew $200,000.00 and placed it into a Standard Chartered Fixed Deposit account under both Parties’ names as a form of check and balance to ensure that he does not spend the money impulsively.[^2] The Husband emphasised that he never intended it to be a gift to the Wife though he used the interest generated towards household expenses. After the fixed deposit account matured, the moneys were placed in a fixed deposit account in the Wife’s name with the State Bank of India on 25 February 2017. The moneys were subsequently rolled over and eventually ended up in the Wife’s CIMB Fixed Deposit Account. According to the Husband, the moneys were placed in the Wife’s name out of convenience and claimed that he emphasised to her that this belonged to his uncle which he eventually must repay. The Husband explained that he pledged this amount to repay a $200,000.00 interest-free loan due to his uncle notwithstanding that his uncle is unaware of this pledge. This loan was disputed by the Wife as she submitted that it was a gift by the Husband’s uncle. I have dealt with this issue at \[29\] below. At this juncture, it suffices for me to state that I agreed with the Husband that his uncle did extend a loan.

13     In response, the Wife comprehensively documented the trail of money that ended up in her CIMB Fixed Account.[^3] The Standard Chartered Fixed Deposit of $200,000.00 was opened on 31 January 2011 with moneys from the Parties’ Standard Chartered joint savings account. The latter account comprised the Parties savings and $400,000.00 from the Husband’s savings account. After the Fixed Deposit matured in January 2013, $150,000.00 was placed into a Maybank Fixed Deposit Account and rolled over in February 2015. An additional Maybank Fixed Deposit Account of $50,000.00 was opened on 26 December 2015. Both were subsequently consolidated and placed in a Fixed Deposit account with the State Bank of India on 25 February 2017 referred to by the Husband above and rolled over in February 2018. These funds were subsequently placed in a Fixed Deposit account in CIMB on 26 August 2019 and rolled over into the account in dispute on 26 November 2019.

14     I found little merit to the Husband’s case. If the sale proceeds from the investment property were not matrimonial assets, the transfer into the Parties’ Standard Chartered joint savings account resulted in it being a matrimonial asset since it commingled with the Parties’ joint asset and were treated as joint funds. In the Husband’s Written Submissions, his counsel cast doubt on whether the Husband even transferred the funds into the joint savings account.[^4] However, it was clear that the Husband did not dispute this in his 2nd Affidavit of Assets and Means.[^5] Even if this was not the case and if the Husband’s version is to be believed, he himself indicated that the moneys were initially placed in a Fixed Deposit Account _under both Parties’ names_ and he used the interest earned towards household expenses. Upon its placement, it became joint funds and was thus a matrimonial asset. I found it particularly telling that the fixed deposits were initially held in both Parties’ names and subsequently in the Wife’s name as it was rolled over into other banks. This underscored the Parties’ treatment of the underlying moneys as joint funds. The Husband’s own admission that he used the interest earned towards household expenses was also consistent with such an understanding.

15     Further, it could not be said that the investment property was a non-matrimonial asset. Some part of it was. Taking the Husband’s case at its highest wherein the investment property was given to him prior to the marriage, he admitted that he financed part of the mortgage payment with monthly payments of $685.00 from his CPF account until it was sold in end-2010.[^6] This means that the repayments made by the Husband, between January 2006 when the Parties were married to end-2010, resulted in part of the investment property becoming a matrimonial asset. See _USB v USA an another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 2 SLR 588</span> (“_USB v USA_”).

16     When both the above grounds were considered individually and cumulatively, it was clear to me that the moneys in the Wife’s CIMB Fixed Deposit Account comprised commingled matrimonial funds and was consequently transformed into a matrimonial asset.

17     For completeness, I refer to the Husband’s argument that the moneys in the Wife’s CIMB Fixed Deposit Account belonged to his uncle because he decided to pledge it to his uncle to repay a loan that he took. I found this to be particularly curious since no financial instrument was prepared and given the Husband’s admission that his uncle was unaware of this pledge. It may very well be that the Husband _intended_ to use these moneys to repay the uncle for the loan but the harbouring of such an intention does not _ipso facto_ transform the matrimonial asset into a non-matrimonial asset.

18     Having dealt with the Wife’s CIMB Fixed Account, I now turn to the Husband’s SGX account. The Husband claimed that he utilised $70,000.00 from the sale proceeds of the investment property gifted to him by his father towards the purchase of shares and he generated an additional $30,000.00 in profit from that investment.[^7] All dividends earned from the shares were received by him and used by him for either personal use or for family expenses. The Husband accordingly submitted that the SGX account should not form part of the pool of matrimonial assets. The Wife submitted that it is a matrimonial asset since the assets therein were accumulated during the marriage. I agreed with the Wife. In support of his case, the Husband only produced a printout of his SGX account statement as at February 2020.[^8] This was insufficient as it failed to persuade me that the shares reflected therein were accumulated from non-matrimonial funds. Further, the shares were acquired during the marriage and, pursuant to my finding above at \[15\], part of the sale proceeds used to purchase the shares was a matrimonial asset. The usage of that matrimonial asset, compounded by the subsequent trading activity, transformed the moneys in the SGX account into a matrimonial asset.

##### (3)   The Wife’s AIA Policy ending 2274 and Husband’s AIA Policy ending 4615

19     The Parties could not agree on whether the Wife’s AIA Policy ending 2274 and the Husband’s AIA Policy ending 4615 were matrimonial assets. For each asset, the opposing party took the position that it was a matrimonial asset.

20     For the Wife’s policy, it was undisputed that it was valued at $17,467.31 and that it was purchased prior to marriage. It was also undisputed that only a single premium of $5,000.00 was paid and that took place prior to the marriage. For the Husband’s policy, it was undisputed that that it was valued at $25,416.32 and it was purchased prior to the marriage. The payment of premiums toward the policy was however disputed. The Husband claimed that only a single premium of $15,000.00 was paid and that took place prior to the marriage. The Wife argued that that there was no documentary proof in support of the Husband’s claim. The Wife however did not produce any evidence to the contrary and I did not find any reason why the Husband would choose to lie about this. I accordingly accepted his evidence in this regard.

21     I was of the view that both policies were not matrimonial assets. Both were purchased prior to the marriage and no premiums were paid during the marriage. There was consequently no evidence that either asset was substantially improved during the marriage by the other party or by both parties to the marriage.

##### (4)   The Husband’s Seletar Club Membership

22     The Husband had a Seletar Club membership in his name valued at $43,000.00. He submitted that this was not a matrimonial asset because it was gifted to him by his father prior to the marriage. The Wife disagreed and argued that it was partially acquired during the marriage through the payment of monthly membership fees and instalments, and that the membership was ordinarily used by both Parties and the children for recreational use.[^9] She explained that the Seletar Club had an extension to its lease which in turn required members to make additional payments. That extension led to the Seletar Club membership increasing in value. The additional payment required from the Husband’s membership was being paid _via_ instalments during the marriage. I agreed with the Wife that the membership was substantially improved during the marriage, but only on account of the payments made towards the Seletar Club extension. The payment of monthly membership fees alone was insufficient to constitute substantial improvement. As such, I did not find it fair and equitable to ascribe the full value of the membership as being a matrimonial asset. Instead, I ascribed a value of $9,000.00, which was the difference in the membership’s value before and after the Seletar Club extension.

#### Gross Value of Matrimonial Assets

23     In light of my decisions above, the gross value of the pool of matrimonial assets stood at **$3,310,647.68** (underlined items have been added to the table of uncontested matrimonial assets found at \[7\]):

#### Matrimonial Liabilities to be Deducted

##### (1)   Uncontested Liabilities

24     The Parties agreed for the outstanding home loan in their joint names for the matrimonial home ($786,488.03), the Husband’s outstanding instalments for the Seletar Country Club extension ($2,778.00), and the Husband’s outstanding car loan ($15,037.35) to be deducted from the pool of matrimonial assets prior to division.

##### (2)   The Husband’s Loan from his Uncle

25     The Parties had strong disagreements whether a loan of $200,000.00 was extended by the Husband’s uncle to assist the Parties in their purchase of the matrimonial home in 2011. The Husband sought for the loan to be deducted from the pool of matrimonial assets prior to division.

26     The Husband’s position was that his uncle extended an interest-free loan to him and it was to be repaid after 10 years, in 2021. The $200,000.00 comprised the following payments: $33,600.00 for stamp fees, $13,000.00 in option fee, $53,400.00 in option exercise fee, and two upfront cash payments of $45,000.00 and $55,000.00 respectively.[^10] The Husband claimed that did not wish to utilise the $200,000.00 that was in a fixed deposit account in 2011 (see \[13\] above) since he would have lost the interest earned if he withdrew the deposit before maturity. The fixed deposit account around the period in question was in both Parties’ name. He explained that he only projected a budget of $1,000,000.00 for the purchase of a private property at that time but the matrimonial home was then offered at the price of $1,300,000.00, which was over his budget.[^11] Out of generosity, his uncle and aunt offered the loan to assist him with the purchase of the matrimonial home.[^12] In support of his version of events, the Husband exhibited an email from his aunt and a handwritten note showing that the $200,000.00 loan was interest-free.[^13] The Wife cast doubt on the authenticity on the documentary evidence produced by the Husband.

27     The Husband’s uncle filed an affidavit to corroborate the Husband’s version of events and averred that his wife, _i.e._ the Husband’s aunt, recorded the terms of the loan on a handwritten note, handled the disbursements of the loan, and documented the completion of the disbursements over email. Since it was the Husband’s aunt that performed the necessary documentation, I found it curious that no affidavit was filed by her. I consequently directed the Husband to obtain an affidavit from his aunt to state her version of events. The Husband’s aunt subsequently filed an affidavit on 15 October 2020 corroborating the Husband’s version of events and affirmed the contemporaneous nature of the documents evidencing the loan. Critically, she affirmed that she sent him the email referred to by the Husband dated 8 September 2011 after the entire loan of $200,000.00 had been disbursed to him to serve as a record for the Husband and his uncle.

28     The Wife’s position was that the $200,000.00 was a gift offered by the Husband’s uncle and aunt to the Parties to help with their purchase of the matrimonial home so that they could vacate the residence that they were then staying in which was owned by the Husband’s father.[^14] She claimed that the move was motivated by the financial strain felt by the Husband’s father in paying for that property’s mortgage. This suggestion was rejected by the Husband.[^15] The Wife argued that no one had ever mentioned that the $200,000.00 was a loan and that there was no mention of repayments being made. She claimed that she first heard about the alleged loan during the divorce proceedings. The Wife averred that she would not have agreed to borrow $200,000.00 in the first place. If she knew it was a loan, she would have repaid it when their fixed deposit account matured in January 2013 and would not have agreed to continue renewing the fixed deposit. The Wife also argued that the Husband’s uncle and aunt came from a wealthy family and that they were known to be generous with their extended families.[^16] Acts of generosity included throwing lavish dinners, gifting her specially brewed tonic, bringing the Parties for a short vacation in Malaysia, and gifting the Husband $50,000 to purchase a car.

29     I accepted the Husband’s version of events on a balance of probabilities. The account provided by the Husband’s aunt was detailed and convincing. In contrast, I was unpersuaded by the Wife’s submissions and arguments. Though I accepted that the Husband’s uncle and aunt were generous, the acts of generosity cited by the Wife in support were not in the same category as gifting the Parties $200,000.00. Further, I found the Wife’s claims that she was unaware of the loan and the lack of demands for repayment to be consistent with the Husband’s version of events since the loan was made directly to the Husband and the repayment was yet to be due.

30     Having found that there was a loan from the Husband’s uncle, the issue was consequently whether it was a matrimonial liability. It cannot be disputed that it was since the loan was undertaken to purchase the matrimonial home. Accordingly, I allowed the loan to be deducted from the pool of matrimonial assets prior to division.

##### (3)   The Wife’s Loan to Purchase a Vehicle

31     The Wife claimed that she borrowed $23,488.00 from her sister to purchase a car. She consequently sought for this loan to be satisfied from the pool of matrimonial assets prior to division. This loan took place during divorce proceedings. She reasoned that she could no longer make use of the Husband’s vehicle without facing strong objections from the Husband and she needed a car to ferry the children around, especially the youngest child who required special care. The Husband disagreed with the proposed deduction since the car was not a necessity and argued that the children would take public transport before and after the Wife’s purchase of the car.

32     I allowed the deduction sought by the Wife as it was reasonable in the circumstances of this case. I found it disingenuous for the Husband to dispute this issue since he clearly enjoyed the benefits of using his car for the family and yet sought to deprive the Wife from incurring a reasonable debt for the same. In fact, the Husband himself sought to deduct his car loan of $15.037.35, which the Wife did not contest. The purchase of a car was reasonable, and the amount involved was also not ostentatious considering the standard of living the Parties enjoyed.

##### (4)   The Wife’s Loan from a Friend

33     The Wife claimed that she borrowed $10,000.00 from a friend prior to the commencement of the divorce proceedings and sought for this loan to be satisfied from the pool of matrimonial assets prior to division. In support, she exhibited a signed ‘IOU’ dated 24 November 2019 to evidence such a loan and her bank statement showing receipt of the said funds.[^17] The Wife’s counsel submitted during oral submissions that the amount borrowed was intended for family expenses.

34     The Husband objected to the proposed deduction. He argued that the loan was obtained in November 2019, which coincided with the time the Wife brought the children on a cruise and that the Wife has not evinced any financial difficulty on her part that necessitated the loan. Further, from the IOU signed by the Wife, the loan was due for repayment on 30 August 2020.

35     I declined the deduction sought by the Wife as I was not persuaded on a balance of probabilities that it was a debt owing or obligation incurred or undertaken by either party for their joint benefit or for the benefit of any child of the marriage. The IOU exhibited did not indicate the purpose of the loan and the bank statement exhibited did not show by any measure that the loan moneys were utilised for the Parties’ joint benefit or for the benefit of the children. The Wife bore the burden of proof since she sought to deduct this debt from the pool of matrimonial assets. She failed to satisfy her burden.

##### (5)   The Wife’s OCBC Credit Card Outstanding Amount

36     The Wife sought to deduct $3,306.71, being the amount outstanding for her OCBC Credit Card, from the pool of matrimonial assets prior to division. She submitted that the outstanding amount arose from family and personal expenses charged to the card for toys, books, groceries, and transit top ups.[^18] During oral submissions, the Husband’s counsel objected to the deduction as it was unclear what was charged to the card and, in particular, pointed on a single charge of $3,649.93 that could not be explained on the face of the credit card statement. Further, the Husband’s counsel argued that the debt has since been extinguished.

37     I allowed the deduction sought by the Wife. She bore the burden to prove that the outstanding sum was incurred for the Parties’ joint benefit or for the benefit of the children. It was not disputed that the outstanding charge reflected was as at the time of the filing of the 1st Affidavit of Assets and Means, closest to the date of Interim Judgment wherein the Parties’ matrimonial assets and liabilities were crystallised. Consequently, it did not matter that the outstanding amount has since been paid. The fact of this liability was also made known in the Wife’s 1st Affidavit of Assets and Means and it was not rejected by the Husband until the hearing of the ancillary reliefs. Finally, whilst the Husband’s counsel correctly pointed out that it was not apparent on the face of the credit card statement what the purpose of the single charge was, it appeared on the whole that the OCBC Credit Card was used ordinarily for expenses benefiting the family and the amount sought appeared to be reasonable. I consequently accepted that the Wife satisfied her burden of proof on a balance of probabilities.

##### (6)   The Wife’s Loan from AIA Policy ending 6125

38     The Wife sought to deduct an outstanding policy loan amount of $1,392.50 from the pool of matrimonial assets. She claimed that this loan was taken in February 2020 to pay for the policy premium. The Husband’s counsel updated the court that the Parties agreed to surrender the policy and that the loan amount will be deducted from the surrender value of the policy. Since the surrender value reflected in the table at \[7\] above had already deducted the loan amount, I agreed with the Husband’s counsel that there was no longer a need to make a further deduction sought by the Wife.

#### Net Value of Matrimonial Assets to be Divided

39     In light of my decisions above, the net value of the pool of matrimonial assets for division stood at **$2,279,549.59**:

> $3,310,647.68 Gross value of the pool of matrimonial assets

> Less

> $786,488.03 Uncontested home loan in the Parties’ joint names for the matrimonial home

> $2,778.00 Uncontested Husband’s outstanding instalments for the Seletar Country Club extension

> $15,037.35 Uncontested Husband’s outstanding car loan

> $200,000.00 Loan from the Husband’s Uncle

> $23,488.00 Loan to Purchase Vehicle

> $3,306.71 OCBC Credit Card Outstanding Amount

### Just and Equitable Division of the Matrimonial Pool of Assets

40     Section 112(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“Women’s Charter”) empowers the court when granting or subsequent to the grant of a judgment of divorce to order the division between the parties of any matrimonial asset or the sale of any such asset and the division between the parties of the proceeds of the sale of any such asset in such proportions as the court thinks _just and equitable_. The guiding principles of exercising this power are set out in s. 112(2) of the Women’s Charter. In its decision in _ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span>, the Court of Appeal laid out a structured approach for the division of matrimonial assets. The Parties were on common ground that the structured approach applied in view of the dual-income nature of their marriage. In _USB v USA_ at \[36\], the structured approached was briefly described by the Court of Appeal as the following steps:

> (a)    first, ascribe a ratio that represents each party’s direct contributions relative to those of the other party, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party has made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets;

> (b)    second, ascribe a second ratio to represent each party’s indirect contribution to the well-being of the family relative to that of the other throughout the marriage; and

> (c)    third, using each party’s respective direct and indirect percentage contributions, derive each party’s average percentage contribution to the family that would form the basis to divide the matrimonial assets.

#### Step 1 – Direct Contributions

41     The Parties were on common ground for almost all issues of direct contributions. Their disagreement only pertained to one component of the matrimonial home and the Wife’s CIMB Fixed Deposit Account ending 0535.

##### (1)   Direct Contributions for the Matrimonial Home

42     The one component of the matrimonial home that required adjudication was the amount of $89,901.37 in upfront cash payment made by the Husband towards its purchase. The Husband claimed that a total of $189,901.37 was paid upfront from his POSB bank account.[^19] $100,000.00[^20] was raised from the loan taken from his uncle and $89,901.37 was raised from the sale proceeds from the investment property located in Balmoral Crescent (referred to at \[11\] above). Accordingly, the Husband submitted that he should receive credit for the $89,901.37 as his direct contributions to the matrimonial home. The Wife rejected the Husband’s submission and argued that the funds originated from the Parties’ joint account. I accepted the Husband’s submission in view of the clear documentary evidence produced, identifying the source of funds being his personal account. In contrast, Wife did not produce evidence that the moneys originated from the Parties’ joint account.

43     In light of my decision above, the Parties’ direct contributions towards the matrimonial home were as follows:

##### (2)   Direct Contributions for the Wife’s CIMB Fixed Deposit Account ending 0535

44     The Husband sought to be credited with direct contributions pertaining to the $207,455.27 found in the Wife’s CIMB Fixed Deposit Account. As indicated earlier at \[12\] and \[17\], the Husband intended to pledge $200,000.00 to his uncle as repayment for the $200,000.00 interest-free loan that was extended. The Wife disagreed and submitted that the Parties should either receive no credit or equal credit in direct contributions in respect of the balance found in that account.

45     I was of the view that neither party should receive any credit. Since these were moneys intended to be used as repayment towards the interest-free loan from the Husband’s uncle, I first considered the Parties’ efforts in obtaining the loan from the Husband’s uncle. There was no effort to speak of from the Wife since her case was premised on her position that the moneys extended by the Husband’s uncle was a gift rather than a loan. There was similarly no effort extended by the Husband since his case was that the moneys were offered to him by his uncle and aunt. He did not seek out the loan. I next considered the source of the funds that eventually found its way into the CIMB Fixed Deposit Account. At \[14\] above, I was of the view that the moneys originated from the Parties’ joint savings account and there was commingling of the Parties’ funds. As a result, I was unable to identify the relative direct contributions made between the Parties. With both of the above circumstances in mind, I found it just and equitable that neither party receives any credit in direct contributions in respect of the Wife’s CIMB Fixed Deposit Account.

##### (3)   Overall Direct Contributions

46     The resulting overall direct contributions ratio stood at **44.05:55.95** in favour of the Husband (underlined items were contested and decided as per the above):

#### Step 2 – Indirect Contributions

47     The Parties made unsurprisingly contrasting submissions on the indirect contributions ratio to be adopted.

48     The Wife submitted that the ratio should be 80:20 in her favour. In summary, she argued that she was the primary caregiver of the three children, especially since the youngest required special care. She also emphasised that she took time off her career to care for the children and accordingly made career sacrifices. She also submitted that the Parties contributed equally in terms of their indirect financial contributions. The Husband argued that the ratio should be 65:35 in his favour. In summary, he submitted that both parties worked during the marriage and his counsel described him as a “super dad” who was actively involved in the children’s care and maintaining the home.

49     I adopted a broad-brush approach as decided and observed by the Court of Appeal in _USB v USA_ at \[43\] – \[46\] for the assessment of the Parties’ indirect contributions. The marriage was of medium length and I considered their respective affidavits of assets and means setting out in detail their cases for indirect contributions. The extent and scope of the Parties’ indirect contributions relative to each other varied over time but it was clear to me that, in the whole, they contributed equally in indirect contributions to their marriage. In particular, I noted the parity of the special care both of them extended to their youngest child. I therefore found it just and equitable to attribute a 50:50 ratio to the Parties’ indirect contributions.

#### Step 3 – Overall Contributions

50     The average ratio of direct and indirect contributions to the pool of matrimonial assets was accordingly **47.03:52.97** in the Husband’s favour. Both Parties further argued that the average ratio ought to be adjusted in their favour in light of their efforts towards their individual care of their youngest child. I did not find those arguments relevant in light of the parity of care that they extended to that child. Further, I saw no reason to further adjust the average ratio as I was the view that such an overall ratio for the division of the pool of matrimonial assets was just and equitable in the circumstances of this case – it was close to equal division.

### Distribution of Matrimonial Assets

51     Following my decision on the division ratio, I granted the Parties liberty to agree on how the matrimonial assets are to be distributed in order to attain the overall division ratio **47.03:52.97** in the Husband’s favour. They managed to agree on the distribution and their agreed distribution was recorded accordingly.

## Conclusion

52     At the conclusion of the hearing, I made no order as to costs in light of the Parties’ reasonable conduct of their respective cases and pursuant to the common submission made by counsel for both Parties.
