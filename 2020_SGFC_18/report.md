### District Judge Sheik Mustafa:

## Introduction

1       The plaintiff is the Wife and the defendant is the Husband. The Wife applied for leave to file a writ of summons for the dissolution of the marriage notwithstanding that 3 years have not passed since the date of the marriage, which was 5 January 2018.

2       The Husband appeared through counsel and contested the summons, but subsequently discharged his counsel and failed to appear or file any affidavits. At the time of the hearing, the marriage stood at 1 year and 10 months. As the Husband was absent, I heard Counsel for the Wife. I dismissed the application. The Wife appeals against that dismissal.

## Background of the case

3       The parties married in Singapore on 5 January 2018. The Wife filed this application on 12 June 2019.

4       At the first case conference on 25 June 2019, the Husband appeared through counsel who informed the Court that the Husband was incarcerated and did not consent to the application. The Husband was directed to file an affidavit in reply.

5       At the following case conference on 14 August 2019, the Husband’s counsel informed the Court that the Husband was going to be released in 4 days, and that counsel had not obtained full instructions, requesting an extension of time of 2 weeks to file the affidavit. There were no objections from the Wife’s counsel.

6       On 4 September 2019, the Husband’s counsel informed the Court that since the Husband’s release from incarceration, counsel had not been able to contact him, and so he applied to be discharged.

7       On 17 September 2019, the Husband’s counsel appeared informed the Court that he will file a summons to be discharged from acting for the Husband. The Husband was not present.

8       At the case conference on 8 October 2019, the Husband’s counsel was discharged. The Husband was again not present. The hearing was fixed. A registrar’s notice was sent to the Husband.

9       On the day assigned for hearing, the Husband did not appear. He had not filed any affidavit in reply to the Wife’s two affidavits. I proceeded to hear the Wife’s counsel.

## Facts presented

10     The Wife had filed 2 affidavits, one by herself and one by her expert. In her affidavit, the Wife laid her case as follows –

> a.     She had married the Husband on 5 January 2018, but as soon as 10 January 2018, he began to stay out for long periods of time and was very secretive about his whereabouts.

> b.     He was rarely at home, leaving home at random times and returning home very late at night.

> c.     He had affairs with no less than 4 women during the marriage.

> d.     He forbade the Wife from asking about his whereabouts. He would get upset and violent.

> e.     The marriage is characterised by bouts of serious domestic abuse inflicted by the Husband on the Wife. The Husband left the Wife with permanent injuries. He also subjected her to a torrent of harassment and psychological abuse.

> f.     On 14 July 2018 after a serious beating, the Wife moved out. The parties never resumed cohabitation.

> g.     The Husband was arrested by the Central Narcotics Bureau and incarcerated in a Drug Rehabilitation Centre until August 2019.

> h.     The Wife applied for, and was granted, a personal protection order against the Husband on 16 January 2019. The Husband consented to the order.

> i.     On 4 February 2019, the Husband, through his solicitors, sent a letter to the Wife “apologising sincerely for the hurt and pain he has caused”. He offered to pay for her medical bills if she agreed to withdraw the personal protection order. The Wife did not do so and the Husband did not pay for her medical bills.

> j.     The Wife contends that the violence was not of minor instances, and characterised it as “one-sided beatings inflicted by an 80kg man on a helpless 48kg woman”. They resulted in permanent damage in the form of myofascial pain syndrome. She has constant pain, discomfort and headaches. She consulted a specialist who opined that there is a causal link between the abuse and the myofascial pain syndrome that she now suffers. The prognosis of the syndrome is variable, and a recovery may be possible over months or years if repeated triggers (ie. physical abuse) is avoided.

> k.     The Wife submits that is clear and unchallenged that she has suffered substantial abuse inflicted by the Husband.

> l.     The Wife further rests her case on the Husband’s adultery, which she describes as “rampant”. The Husband has had relations with at least three women during the course of their short marriage. The Wife adduced evidence of a private investigator’s report in support of this.

> m.     The Wife also relies on the Husband’s “wanton cruelty” in that he regularly belittled, demeaned, taunted and threatened her. He expressed desire for her to be raped, and other despicable things.

> n.     The Wife submits that reconciliation is not possible. Her counsel argues that to hold her to wait for the remainder of the three years would be visiting the wrongs of the Husband on her.

## Applicable principles

11     The law to apply on this issue flows from section 94 of the Women’s Charter, which states as follows:

> **Restriction on filing of writ for divorce during first 3 years of marriage**

> **94.—(1**)    No writ for divorce shall be filed in the court unless at the date of the filing of the writ 3 years have passed since the date of the marriage.

> (2)    The court may, upon application being made in accordance with the Family Justice Rules made under section 139, allow a writ to be filed before 3 years have passed on the ground that the case is one of exceptional hardship suffered by the plaintiff or of exceptional depravity on the part of the defendant, …

12     Counsel for the Wife relied on the case of _Ng Kee Shee v Fu Gaofei_[^1]. In that case, the wife had totally deserted the husband, less than 3 months into the marriage. She had stated to him in absolute terms that she wanted to be released from the marriage. The husband applied for leave to commence divorce proceedings before the lapse of 3 years. The wife did not appear in the proceedings.

13     In allowing the husband’s application, Justice Tay Yong Kwang stated–

> “I agree with the pronouncement that the laudatory intention of s 94 is to promote sanctity of marriage and to ensure that parties do not rush into and out of marriage capriciously. Here, it was clearly the wife who had absolutely no regard for the union and who was the one who entered into the arranged marriage capriciously. To hold that the husband should nevertheless wait three years before seeking a divorce appears to be visiting the wrongs of the wife on him. After all, he was serious about the marriage and he would like to have his wife back. It was she who abandoned him and the matrimonial home and chose to leave a gulf of more than 1,000km between them, avowing over and over again that she was never coming back. There is nothing left to reconcile in such a situation. One cannot rekindle a flame that was never lit.”

14     Counsel did not, however, cite the case of _Tan Yan Ling Kyna v Chan Wei Zhong Terence_[^2]. In that case, the wife applied for leave to commence divorce proceedings before the lapse of 3 years. She alleged that the husband abused her on a number of occasions. This was disputed by the husband. The wife in that case, just like the Wife in the present case, adduced a psychiatric report that diagnosed her to be suffering a major depressive disorder, and that the husband’s aggression was the main causative factor in it.

15     Justice Choo Han Teck dismissed the wife’s application. His Honour stated as follows –

> “6.    The statutory moratorium of three years is to impress upon married couples that marriage is not an event that one can sign in and out as they fancy. In the meantime, there are alternative remedies and relief in cases of abuse and they include applications for a personal protection order. The aggrieved party may also leave the other party, as this plaintiff has done. The moratorium is intended to hold out the hope of reconciliation – and who is to say that even in extreme cases of abuse, the abuser may not see the error of his or her ways and reconcile with the other?”

16     The two cases are consistent in that the Court’s underlying consideration is that of the probability of reconciliation. In fact, sub-section (3) of section 94 mandates so –

> (3)    In determining any application under this section for leave to file a writ before the expiration of 3 years from the date of the marriage, the court _shall have regard_ to the interest of any child of the marriage and to the question whether there is _reasonable probability_ of a reconciliation between the parties before the expiration of the said 3 years.

17     What is the threshold of reasonable probability of a reconciliation? It cannot be on a balance of probabilities, which would place an undue difficulty to find at such a stage. It depends on the facts of each case. Factors to consider include, but not limited to, the presence of parties in the same country, whether both parties treat the marriage as if it has ended, whether the hardship or cruelty complained of continues to subsist or is likely to before the expiration of the 3 years.

## Findings and conclusion

18     This is case of a 1 year 10 month marriage. There are no children. The grounds of exceptional hardship based on are repeated adultery and wanton cruelty by the defendant. Parties are living separately. A personal protection order was granted in January 2019 against the defendant. No violence has occurred since then, and it has been a year.

19     The adultery and violence relied upon appear to have ceased and thus the cruelty has lifted, for now. The facts of this case is to be distinguished from those of _Ng Kee Shee v Fu Gaofei_. In that case, the defendant did not appear, and the facts revealed that there was absolutely no possibility of reconciliation. As His Honour Justice Foo found, “there \[was\] nothing left to reconcile in such a situation. One cannot rekindle a flame that was never lit.” In that case, unlike the present one, the cruelty relied upon continued, and was likely to continue.

20     After he had agreed to the issuance of the personal protection order, the Husband sent a letter to the Wife “apologising sincerely for the hurt and pain he has caused”. He offered to pay for her medical bills if she agreed to withdraw the personal protection order. In the present application, the Husband appeared, and contested the application, although for reasons unknown, he did not continue to appear. The circumstances are different from those of _Ng Kee Shee v Fu Gaofei_, where the wife deserted the husband and categorically informed him that she wanted to end the marriage.

21     In my view, the facts of the present case are closer to those of _Tan Yan Ling Kyna v Chan Wei Zhong Terence_, and applying the reasoning of that judgment, I similarly find that there remains a reasonable probability of reconciliation before the expiration of 3 years.

22     It must be stressed a reasonable probability of reconciliation is not to say that a reconciliation is likely to take place. A reconciliation may appear to be not likely to happen in the circumstances, but it cannot be said that there is no reasonable probability. Therefore, the present case has not satisfied that requirement of section 94(3).

23     This finding is, of course, without prejudice to the Wife’s right to commence proceedings to dissolve the marriage after the expiration of the 3-year period.
