Personal Protection Order

26 August 2020

### District Judge Goh Zhuo Neng:

## A.   INTRODUCTION

1       These were proceedings by two brothers for Personal Protection Orders (“**PPO**”) against each other (collectively referred to as the “**Applications**”).

> a)     SS 124 of 2020 – Complainant (“**BCD**”) for a PPO against Respondent (“**EFG**”). Filed on 16 January 2020 (“**BCD’s Application**”).

> b)     SS 184 of 2020 – Complainant (EFG) for a PPO against Respondent (BCD). Filed on 29 January 2020 (“**EFG’s Application**”).

2       Both parties do not live together. Together with other factions in their family, they are embroiled in a dispute concerning their Mother. These disputes are the subject of separate proceedings in FC/OSM XX and XX- (has to be redacted, otherwise the parties will be known) of 2019. I say nothing of those proceedings.

3       This is also not the first time that parties have commenced proceedings against each other for PPOs. On 26 July 2019, I heard and dismissed SSXXX of 2019 and SSXXXX of 2018(same as para 2) which were filed respectively by BCD and EFG for PPOs against each other.

4       In the Applications, a considerable number of allegations relating to their Mother, and their personal affairs were levelled in the documents presented to Court. I informed parties that while their underlying family dispute provided some context for their disagreements, I would not make a determination on them. Those matter were for the consideration of the Court in FC/OSM XX and XX of 2019 (same for para 2). I was mainly concerned with the allegations involving alleged family violence against each other which were particularised in their complaints:

> a)     BCD’s Application – the event of 13 January 2020 where EFG allegedly assaulted him physically in the Family Justice Courts (“**13 January Incident**”).

> b)     EFG’s Application – the event of 15 January 2020 where BCD allegedly caused harassment to EFG by calling the police (“**15 January Incident**”).

5       I proceeded to hear the Applications by Zoom Video Conference by the consent of both parties. The documents admitted for the purposes of the hearing were:

> a)     The Complaints filed by the parties in respect of the Applications, and the respective documents attached to them – including a police report made by EFG on 24 January 2020 (“**EFG’s Police Report**”).

> b)     The Affidavit sworn by EFG on 5 March 2020.

> c)     The Statement and documents prepared by BCD on 6 March 2020 (“**BCD’ Statement**”). There was also a video of the 15 January Incident (“**15 Jan Recording**”)

> d)     A close circuit video provided by the Police which captured the 13 January Incident (“**13 Jan Recording**”).

6       By cover of a letter dated 20 April 2020, EFG had written to Court forwarding a Statement dated 15 April 2020 and other documents (“**EFG’s Statement**”). The EFG’s Statement was filed in response to BCD’s Statement. It had not been served on BCD prior to the hearing. Moreover, the allegations and issues addressed in EFG’s Statement were more relevant to the personal affairs of the parties and their relationship with their Mother. Accordingly, I did not allow it to be admitted into evidence.

7       After hearing the parties, I proceeded to dismiss EFG’s Application, and granted BCD’s Application for a PPO against EFG. I directed that the PPO would be of limited duration and expire on 13 April 2021. Parties were also directed to attend counselling and a counselling review was fixed on 14 January 2021.

8       On 26 May 2020, EFG filed his Notice of Appeal against my decision in the Applications. I set out below my full grounds of decision.

## B.   THE LAW

## I.    Family Violence

9       Section 65 read with Section 64 of The Women’s Charter defines “_family violence_” as the commission of any of the following acts:

> (a)     wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;

> (b)     causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;

> (c)     wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his will; or

> (d)     causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member.

10     “_Hurt_” as referred to in (a) and (b) above means “_bodily pain, disease or infirmity_”. The Women’s Charter also clarifies that “_family violence_” does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age.

## II.    Physical Violence

11     The spectrum of physical violence, restraint or threats that can amount to family violence is quite broad. Findings of family violence have been made in the following cases involving a single act or repeated acts of physical violence, restraint or threats. For instance:

> (a)     A man prevented his wife from leaving the home by pushing her and holding on to the gate so that she could not open it (_NR v NQ_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] SGMC 4</span>).

> (b)     A man had slammed sister against a wall when she grabbed him in order to restrain him from attacking her friend (_Tan Ying Hui (Chen Yinghui) v Tan Zhi Xuan_ \[2011\] SGDDC 49).

## III.    Continual Harassment

12     Continual harassment was helpfully defined in the case of _Yue Tock Him@Yee Chok Him v Yee Ee Lim_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGDC 99</span>[^1] (“**Yue**”) at \[33\] as :

> _“a course of conduct by a person, whether by words or action, directly or through third parties, sufficiently repetitive in nature as would cause and which he ought reasonably to know would cause worry, emotional distress of annoyance to another person…”._

13     However, given the infinite ways in which people are capable of causing distress or annoyance to each other, this should not be regarded as an exhaustive definition. That was also the view of the Court in _Yue_, which noted that the above definition was _“not intended to be an exhaustive definition of the term but rather one that sufficiently encompasses the facts of the present case in order to proceed with a consideration of the law.”_

14      _Yue_ also provided at \[42\], that the acts of “_continual harassment_” must also be of a sufficiently serious magnitude in order to be regarded as “_family violence_”. Consequently, in the case of _Chua Li Choo v Teo Swee Theng_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGDC 241</span>, at \[22\], it was held that making a police report did not amount to continual harassment. In that case, a husband had made a police report after the wife had locked him out of the marital home and told him that she would only let him in if he called the police.

15     This approach is understandable. At the end of the day, and given the extremely wide scope of acts that may be raised as allegations of continual harassment, a sensible and balanced approach must be taken. After all, protection orders are meant to protect people from harmful acts, and if the threshold is lowered to include acts that are merely unpleasant but without sufficient gravity, then this may result in individuals abusing the court process to settle their own petty personal disputes or vendettas.

## IV.    Necessity

16     Even after a finding of family violence is made on the facts, the Court still has to make its assessment of whether it is necessary to grant a protection order.

17     Necessity is determined by whether there are likely to be further acts of family violence committed against the particular family member, in the event that a protection order is not granted.

18     This is because a personal protection order is not a punitive measure to punish a person for past violence but is instead a preventive order that serves to restrain the person concerned from committing family violence in future. Therefore, if there will be no family violence in future, it serves no purpose to restrain the party concerned, and it must follow that a personal protection order would not be necessary (_Yue_, at \[64\]).

19     In determining necessity, the Court must consider all the circumstances, but it is useful to weigh up the following factors.

> a)     Are the parties still living together or likely to remain in contact?

> b)     What is the original cause of the conflict and has it been resolved?

> c)     The severity of the incident of family violence.

20     I will now address the facts and the application of law to the facts.

## C.   THE 13 JANUARY INCIDENT

21     In respect of both the 13 January Incident, both parties had their own versions of what happened.

> a)     BCD claimed that he had been punched by EFG on the left side of the face, by EFG’s right hand, causing an abrasion in his mouth which bled. This occurred at the Family

> Justice Court just before parties were to attend a mediation. BCD was going to push their Mother over to the mediation chamber in her wheelchair, when he was struck by

> EFG in the face. He tried to block the punch but was unable to do so. Pictures and a medical examination dated 15 January 2020 were tendered to Court by BCD.

> b)     EFG claimed that he had merely gesticulated at BCD’s face. This was in response to BCD vigorously pushing the Mother’s wheelchair towards EFG, who at the time was examining his Mother’s feet and talking to her. EFG had lost his balance as a result of BCD pushing the wheelchair. He got up and gesticulated at BCD’s face in response. As BCD’s face moved forward quickly, EFG ended up sticking his fingers in BCD’ mouth.

22     In cross examination, EFG questioned why BCD had only obtained a medical report on 15 January 2020, when the incident had taken place on 13 January 2020. BCD explained that he had gone to see a doctor on 13 January 2020, but was told that in order to obtain a medical report, he would need to make a police report. He did so on 15 January 2020 and was re-examined by the same doctor on 15 January 2020 who concluded that there was mild inner cheek swelling on his left cheek, and a gum abrasion was noted above his 1st upper molar tooth. This was corroborated by the pictures provided by BCD.

23     A viewing of the 13 January Video indicated that:

> a)     The Mother’s wheelchair was initially being pushed by a domestic helper down a corridor.

> b)     EFG was walking down from the opposite end of the corridor.

> c)     The domestic helper stopped pushing the wheelchair upon meeting EFG.

> d)     EFG squatted down in front of the wheelchair and spoke to his Mother.

> e)     BCD came over and took over the wheelchair from the domestic helper. He placed both hands on the wheelchair.

> f)     Almost as soon as BCD had taken over the wheelchair, EFG stood up and exchanged words with BCD.

> g)     Suddenly, EFG moved his hand very quickly into BCD’s face.

> h)     BCD’s head was knocked backwards by the impact.

24     During this brief incident, BCD or the wheelchair hardly moved forward. It was impossible to tell whether EFG had lost his balance. However, it was clear that EFG had without provocation, stood up and pushed his hand into BCD’ face.

## D.   THE 15 JANUARY INCIDENT

25     In respect of the 15 January Incident, BCD admitted that he had called the police while EFG was at his Mother’s home visiting her. According to him, EFG was only allowed to visit the Mother at her home from 6pm to 8pm on Wednesdays and Fridays. It is not disputed that by 8 pm, EFG had indicated his intention to leave the Mother’s house and was preparing to leave. Nonetheless, BCD proceeded to call the police.

## E.   APPLICATION OF THE LAW TO THE FACTS

26     In respect of EFG’s Application, the 15 January Incident was insufficient to amount to continual harassment. It was the only specific incident referred to in his complaint and EFG’s Police Report. BCD’s actions struck me as unnecessary. However, one incident alone cannot amount to a continual course of conduct. The act of making a police report, even in these circumstances, is not of sufficiently serious magnitude to amount to family violence. Therefore I dismissed EFG’s Application.

27     In respect of BCD’s Application, family violence was clearly made out as EFG had struck him deliberately without provocation. I determined that it was necessary to grant a PPO restraining EFG from committing family violence against BCD for the following reasons.

> a)     While this was a single incident, and the injury caused to BCD was not a grievous one, it was unprovoked.

> b)     EFG was also likely to commit further family violence as the cause of tension between the parties still remained. The parties continued to remain in contact with each other as EFG would continue to visit the Mother’s house. The parties also remained engaged in proceedings in OSM XX of 2019 which were still pending.

> c)     EFG was unlikely to be deterred from further violence by a warning. EFG had been involved in prior proceedings for a PPO and should have been well aware of the consequences if he committed family violence. Yet, he struck BCD without provocation, and he did so in the Family Justice Courts of all places, and prior to a mediation.

28     Taking into account the fact that the parties did not live with each other, and the cause of tension may be resolved eventually, I decided that it would be sufficient for me to order a PPO of limited duration. As I was directing the parties to attend counselling, I provided that the PPO would expire in on 13 April 2021, about 3 months after the counselling review concluded on 14 January 2021.
