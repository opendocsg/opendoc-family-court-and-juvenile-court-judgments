9 March 2021

### District Judge Darryl Soh:

## Introduction

1       This matter concerns ancillary reliefs arising from acrimonious divorce proceedings between the Plaintiff-Wife (“Wife”) and the Defendant-Husband (“Husband”) (collectively referred to as the “Parties”). Multiple proceedings were commenced prior to the hearing on 30 October and 25 November 2020. Orders arising from earlier proceedings provided the critical context and background between the Parties. Final orders in the divorce proceedings were made on financial matters and the child’s care on 25 November 2020. The Wife has since appealed against the whole of my decision. In these grounds, I explain my decision in detail.

## Background Facts

2       The Parties were married in June 2014. Later in the same month, their daughter (the “Child”) was born. Both are in their mid-30s. The Husband is a United Kingdom citizen and holds an Employment Pass in Singapore. The Wife and Child are both Singapore citizens, though the Child only possesses a British passport at the time of the hearing. As at the time of issuance of these Grounds, the Child would have commenced her first year in a Primary School in the central part of Singapore. The Husband was employed throughout the marriage and is currently an executive. In contrast, a year into the marriage, the Wife ceased employment. According to her, she was effectively a full-time mother and a homemaker during the marriage. Two years later, the Parties’ relationship broke down in June 2016 and they lived in separate bedrooms. They subsequently moved into separate residences from 25 November 2016 when the Wife was made to leave the matrimonial home that the Parties were then renting. After leaving the matrimonial home, the Wife returned to employment and took up pre-school and administrative roles.

3       After the Parties’ moved into separate residences, legal proceedings quickly followed. It marked the start of five years of bitter litigation with numerous affidavits of child-related allegations against each other.

4       The Parties took out cross applications for interim custody and care and control of the Child _vide_ OSG 220/2016[^1] by the Husband and OSG 235/2016[^2] by the Wife. Both OSGs were heard by the learned District Judge Michelle Elias Solomon (“DJ Elias”) and orders were made on 20 July 2017. _Inter alia_, the Parties were granted joint custody and shared care and control of the Child. The full list of orders made can be found at _Annex 1_. The learned District Judge issued detailed Grounds of Decision in _UGQ v UGR_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGFC 125</span> on 31 October 2017 (the “2017 OSG GD”), which included the relevant and material background to the Parties’ dispute at \[5\] – \[14\]. I shall adopt and refer to that background (for the period prior to 31 October 2017) for the purposes of these Grounds. Both Parties appealed against the orders made on 20 July 2017 _vide_ DCAs 105/2017 and 106/2017 by the Husband and DCAs 110/2017 and 111/2017 by the Wife. The appeals were heard and dismissed by the learned Judicial Commissioner Tan Puay Boon on 30 April 2018.

5       I find it relevant to point out that after DJ Elias issued the 2017 OSG GD, the Wife filed an application for interim maintenance on 24 November 2017 _vide_ MSS 801882/2017. The application was contested by the Husband. The application was heard and dismissed by DJ Elias on 8 February and 16 March 2018 respectively. There were also proceedings for a Personal Protection Order commenced by the Husband _vide_ SS 466/2017 on behalf of the Child. These proceedings were subsequently withdrawn on 19 July 2017 on account of both Parties providing an undertaking to the court.

6       Shortly before the appeals against the orders made on 20 July 2017 were heard, the Wife commenced divorce proceedings against the Husband on 9 March 2018. The Husband subsequently filed a counterclaim on 5 April 2018. The divorce proceeded on an uncontested basis for both the claim and counterclaim. The marriage was dissolved on account that both behaved in a way that the opposing Party cannot be reasonably be expected to live with the other Party. Interim Judgment was granted on 18 September 2018 and ancillary reliefs were adjourned to be heard in Chambers.

7       The Parties subsequently filed several interlocutory applications. They filed for discovery and interrogatories _vide_ SUM 2121/2019 by the Husband and SUM 3336/2019 by the Wife. In SUM 2716/2019, the Husband applied for variations to be made to the 20 July 2017 orders pertaining to the safeguarding and renewal of the Child’s passport and for the Husband to bring the Child overseas during several stipulated periods. The Parties reached an agreement on 16 September 2019 for the Husband to bring the Child to Thailand for a holiday in December 2019. However, on 11 November 2019, the Wife filed for a stay of execution of the order _vide_ SUM 3883/2019 as she came to know that the Husband’s employment had ceased with his then-employer and was of the view that the Husband was a flight risk. The Wife’s application was subsequently heard and dismissed by DJ Elias on 26 November 2019. On 22 October 2020, shortly before the ancillary reliefs were due for hearing on 30 October 2020, the Wife applied for further interrogatories _vide_ SUM 3201/2020 to be answered by the Husband following his change in residence. I heard the application and made no order on the Wife’s application on 30 October 2020.

## Issues in Dispute and Orders Made

8       The following ancillary reliefs necessitated adjudication:

> (a)     Child’s care arrangements;

> (b)     Division of matrimonial assets;

> (c)     Wife’s maintenance; and

> (d)     Child’s maintenance.

9       After hearing the Parties’ evidence and submissions, I made the following summarised orders:

> (a)     The Parties were granted joint custody by consent and shared care and control of the Child. This involved a continuation of applicable orders made on 20 July 2017;

> (b)     The Parties were granted liberty to bring the Child out of the jurisdiction during their respective school holiday time with the Child. Similarly, I granted the Husband liberty to bring the Child to the United Kingdom every other year for the year-end Christmas and New Year holidays. Both orders were subject to travel advisories against non-essential travel issued by the Singapore government;

> (c)     With respect to the division of matrimonial assets, I ordered the Parties to retain their respective assets that were in their sole names;

> (d)     No spousal maintenance to be paid to the Wife; and

> (e)     The Husband to be responsible for the Child’s school fees, several specific expenses, and specified enrichment classes. If a Party wishes to enrol the Child for additional enrichment classes, that Party is to be solely responsible for those expenses. If the Child has been asked to go on an overseas trip by the school, the Parties are to share the costs of that trip equally.

10     The full list of orders I made on 25 November 2020 can be found at _Annex 2_. The Wife has appealed against all orders. I now set out my reasons for those orders in turn.

## Child’s Care Arrangements

11     The Parties were on common ground that they be granted joint custody of the Child. This order was consequently recorded by consent.[^3] They however could not agree on the Child’s care and control.

### Care and Control

12     Both Parties submitted that they individually be granted sole care and control, arguing for a departure from the shared care and control orders made on 20 July 2017.

13     The Husband contended that he would be the parent to provide the Child with the stability and care necessary for her continued development.[^4] The Child would be in a familial environment where she had essentially grown up, was accustomed to, and that he is the parent that is more willing to facilitate access and attempt to co-parent with the Wife. He emphasised that he is a more stable position financially compared to the Wife and has consistently shown himself to place the Child’s interests above all else by changing and maintaining his lifestyle towards such goals. The Husband argued that a shared care and control arrangement would effectively disrupt the Child’s education. He alleged that the Wife has a lack of concern over the Child’s education and that the Wife will not mutually respect him or cooperate with him in raising the Child.

14     The Wife advanced three main reasons why she ought to be granted sole care and control of the Child.[^5] First, that she has been the Child’s primary caregiver since birth and is more familiar with the intricacies of the Child’s care than the Husband. Second, that jurisprudence sets forth that when all things being equal, care and control of a young infant or child would usually be granted to mothers. Finally, she argued that shared care and control is not feasible as the Parties have an extremely tumultuous relationship and the lack of co-operation is likely to be harmful to the Child if the shared care arrangement subsisted.

15     In deliberating the appropriate care orders to be made, s. 125 of the Women’s Charter \[Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed\] (“the Women’s Charter”) prescribes that the paramount consideration for the court shall be the welfare of the child. Having considered the Parties’ respective submissions and affidavits, I did not agree with either Party as I was of the view that it would be in the Child’s best interests _in the circumstances of this case_ that the Parties continue with their share care and control arrangement. Both Parties are good parents individually and they have the Child’s best interests at heart.

16     In _TAU v TAT_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 1089</span> at 1095, Justice Debbie Ong observed that in considering whether shared care and control would be in the child’s welfare, the court will have to consider several factors. This included the particular child’s needs at that stage of life, the extent to which the parents are able to co-operate within such an arrangement, and whether it is easy for that child, bearing in mind his or her age and personality, to live in two homes within one week.

17     I first considered the existing orders in place between the Parties. The Parties were granted shared care and control of the Child on 20 July 2017. As a weekly routine, the Child would spend every Tuesday 7pm to Saturday 7pm with the Husband and Saturday 7pm to Tuesday 7pm with the Wife. The Parties were dissatisfied with the shared care and control order and both appealed against that order. The appeals were subsequently dismissed. By the time the ancillary reliefs were heard on 30 October and 25 November 2020, the Child was six and a half years old and this weekly routine would have been in place for approximately three and a half years. This constitutes more than half her lifetime and was a familiar routine to the Child. As such, I was _prima facie_ of the view that preserving this _status quo_ would be in the best interests of the Child as it will allow the Child to continue developing in a familiar familial environment. See _Lim Chin Huat Francis and another v Lim Kok Chye Ivan and another_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 2 SLR(R) 392</span>; _Wong Phila Mae v Shaw Harold_ <span class="citation">\[1991\] 1 SLR(R) 680</span>; and my earlier decision in _TKT v TKS_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGFC 21</span>.

18     I next considered whether there have been instances of concern that suggest for the _status quo_ to be discontinued. Each Party was keen to blame the Party opposite, accusing each other of being uncooperative with regard to the Child. The types of accusations advanced were not new. They were similar in nature to earlier proceedings and have been succinctly summarised in the 2017 OSG GD. Three years on, the Parties continue to paint the other parent as selfish, irresponsible and incapable. Their individual perspectives were manifestations of their distrust for one another, formed by their very own actions years ago when the marriage broke down – the Husband unilaterally sought to exclude the Wife from the Child in 2016 and the Wife unilaterally ought to remove the Child from her school in 2017. The Parties are both capable and responsible parents individually but clinging onto such distrust is significantly detrimental to the Child, risking her development and future. I have no doubt that they _can_ co-operate with each other. Unfortunately, they have deliberately chosen not to do so.

19     A further manifestation of the Parties’ distrust for one another came to the fore shortly before the hearing of the ancillary reliefs on 30 October 2020. On 14 October 2020, the Husband and his mother moved out of their rented home in \[Rental Property 1\] to \[Rental Property 2\]. The Wife took serious issue with this move. She applied for discovery and interrogatories on this change of residence and alluded to this change when advancing a revision of the care and control orders. The Wife argued that the move was abrupt, and that there was no genuine attempt at communication by the Husband.

20     I did not find the Husband’s change in residence to materially warrant a departure from the shared care and control orders. Instead, I found the Wife’s reaction to this change to be disproportionate. Even though the Husband does not drive, he has informed the court that he usually works from home since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and he plans to ferry the Child to school during the days he has care and control _via_ ride hailing services. For the return journey, either his mother or helper will ferry the Child back if he is unable to personally do so. At peak timings, the journey will only take 20 minutes between the Husband’s new residence and the Child’s school. This commute arrangement is entirely reasonable, especially when both the Parties’ homes are in the broader central region of Singapore. While the physical environment has changed, the familial environment has not. While in the Husband’s care and control, the Child continues to be cared for by the Husband and his mother.

21     Similarly, the Husband referred to the Parties’ inability to communicate with regard to the Child’s passport and to bringing the Child overseas as grounds to depart from the shared care and control orders. With respect, I did not find merit to these arguments as the Parties’ conduct on those specific issues can be effectively regulated through court orders.

22     I consequently found no basis to discontinue the shared care and control orders. In fact, in the circumstances of this case, a departure from those orders would not be in the best interests of the Child as she would have to adjust to a new routine and would find herself once again the subject of litigation while her parents attempt to find a new equilibrium to any new orders the court makes to her weekly routine. The Parties have been individually seeking a win over the other Party at every turn, but they consistently fail to realise that regardless of which parent wins in this seemingly unending war, they have collectively undermined the future of their Child. Valuable time, resources and emotions the past few years spent on litigation could have been instead channelled to the Child. These cannot be recovered, and they risk losing more if they are to continue their destructive conduct. They ought to be reminded of their obligation to _co-operate_ with each other in the caring and providing for their Child pursuant to s. 46(1) of the Women’s Charter.

23     The Wife also sought an adjustment to the Child’s current time spent between the Parties. The Wife’s counsel pointed out that the Husband has one additional night with the Child when compared to the Wife and suggested that the Parties alternate between three and four nights with the Child. I did not find this to be in the best interests of the Child given her young age and such an alternating arrangement will serve to confuse the Child and introduce added practical complexities to the already established weekly routine.

24     In light of the above, I ordered the continuation of the applicable shared care and control orders made on 20 July 2017 (_i.e._ paragraphs 2 to 30 of _Annex 1_).

### Arrangements to bring the Child Overseas

25     The Husband sought additional orders pertaining to the Child’s passport, to grant the Parties liberty to bring the Child overseas during their respective school holiday time with the Child, and for him to be granted liberty to bring the Child to the United Kingdom every two years commencing 2022.[^6] In the care orders made on 20 July 2017, the Parties were not allowed to remove the Child from Singapore unless by mutual consent or by court order. This order led to disagreements between the Parties, _i.e._ the Husband’s applications to bring the Child overseas in SUMs 1266/2018[^7], 2104/2019[^8], and 2716/2019 (see above at \[7\]). The Wife objected to the Husband’s request, arguing that the Husband was a flight risk. The Wife’s counsel explained that this risk arises because of the lack of trust between the Parties.

26     I allowed the Husband’s requests for a fixed framework for overseas time, with some adjustments. The Wife’s fear of the Husband being a flight risk was unfounded. Lack of trust does not _ipso facto_ translate into a flight risk. The Husband had brought the Child overseas before without any indication of an intention to abduct. Importantly, I found it unsustainable and against the Child’s best interests for the Parties to regularly turn to the court when they have disagreements on overseas time during school holidays. Cyclical litigations on this issue is clearly detrimental to the Child as it unnecessarily triangulates the Parties’ disagreements on the Child on a regular basis. The procedural safeguards of notice, details of travel, and safekeeping of the Child’s passport by the Wife were reasonable and would provide sufficient assurances in the circumstances, especially if the perception of an individual’s flight risk originates from the Parties’ distrust for one another. Such safeguards will facilitate the flow of information and create a working partnership for co-parenting.

27     I would also add that the Parties’ marriage was cross-cultural in nature and it was reasonable for the Husband to seek a standing arrangement for the Child to be brought to the United Kingdom. This will allow the Child to maintain bonds and relationships with the Husband’s family. In return, the Husband rightfully proposed for the Child to spend the entirety of Chinese New Year with the Wife. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic however provided good reason not to fully liberalise overseas travel for the Child. I therefore suggested that overseas travel be subject to travel advisories against non-essential travel issued by the Singapore government. Counsel for both Parties agreed with this suggestion and for it to be incorporated into the applicable orders.[^9] For completeness, I saw no reason to make the additional orders requested by the Husband in respect of the Child’s British passport[^10] as I was of the view that her passport should continue to be kept by the Wife[^11] pursuant to the above at \[26\].

### Other Adjustments

28     The Husband sought further adjustments to be made to the orders made on 20 July 2017 following my decision to continue with the shared care and control arrangements.[^12] I was only minded to grant the adjustments relating to (a) the Parties’ attendance at the Child’s school functions or events, (b) the Parties apprising the Party opposite of the Child’s enrolment in enrichment classes, and (c) the demarcation of time between the Parties during the Child’s birthday. The Wife’s counsel had no objections to (a) and (b) so I ordered it accordingly.[^13]

29     With regard to (c), the Wife’s counsel submitted that the current arrangements seem to work, that is, for the Husband and Wife to celebrate the Child’s birthday together with her on her birthday and that each parent shall also be at liberty to have separate celebrations with her before/after her birth date.[^14] The Husband’s counsel disagreed, arguing that such an arrangement will be difficult when the Child commences Primary School in 2021. I agreed with the Husband’s counsel and I ordered the following reasonable arrangements between the Parties for the Child’s birthday:[^15]

> (a)     If \[the Child’s\] birthday falls over the weekend, then no special arrangements are required as both parents have one weekend day each with \[the Child\] to celebrate. Essentially, each parent shall be at liberty to have separate celebrations with her before/after her birth date.

> (b)     If \[the Child’s\] birthday falls on a school day then the parent without time with or care of \[the Child\] should collect \[the Child\] from school and take her to lunch for 1.5 hours or take her for afternoon tea for 1.5 hours after school hours. The parent without time with \[the Child\] or care of \[the Child\] will return \[the Child\] to the usual pick up point at the residence of the parent with time with \[the Child\] or care of \[the Child\]. For the avoidance of doubt, there will be no access call on that evening.

#### Contested Assets

##### (1)   Husband’s United Kingdom Property

31     The Husband and his mother own a small flat in the United Kingdom that was purchased in 2007 (_i.e._ prior to the marriage) for £184,500.00. The property has an estimated value of £210,000.00 to £215,000.00 with a mortgage of £164,050.00.[^17] The Wife submitted that this is a matrimonial asset since the Husband would pay for the property with his bonus moneys. In her 2nd Affidavit of Asset and Means, the Wife explained that the Husband utilised matrimonial funds such as their joint Savings Account towards the repayments, upkeep or support of the property. She estimates that the Husband would transfer $20,000.00 each December, after receiving his bonus for the year.

32     The Husband denied that he contributed any financing whatsoever towards the property save for the interest on the mortgage and utilities when he lived in the flat from May 2007 until 2010 (_i.e._ prior to the marriage). The deposit, down payments and costs associated with the purchase of the property were funded by the Husband’s mother. The property is currently being rented out and the rental income usually covers the monthly interest payments to the mortgage lender. The rental income does not however cover any mortgage loan or property expenses, of which his mother makes up for from her savings. The only mortgage repayment ever made was in the sum of £1,700 by the Husband’s mother in 2016. The Husband’s mother filed an affidavit to affirm the above and categorically stated that the Husband has not contributed to the purchase or maintenance or made any mortgage repayments whatsoever towards the property either before or since the Husband moved to Singapore in 2010.

33     I agreed with the Husband that the property was not a matrimonial asset. There was no dispute that the property was purchased prior to the Parties’ marriage. Accordingly, the Wife needed to prove that the property fell under the definitions either in s. 112(10)(_a_)(i) or (ii) of the Women’s Charter. The Wife could prove neither. She could not produce any evidence in support of her claim that the Husband would pay for the property with his bonus moneys in opposition to the supporting documents produced by the Husband and his mother.

##### (2)   Husband’s Unaccounted Income

34     At the hearing on 25 November 2020, the Wife’s counsel submitted that the Wife is seeking for the Husband’s income that was unaccounted for, after deducting living expenses, to be added back into the pool of matrimonial assets. I found this submission vague. In reply to my queries, the Wife’s counsel could not provide any amount for the court’s consideration and could not provide any evidence of dissipation. As such, I did not see a need for the Husband to respond given that the Wife clearly failed to first put together a rational case or argument other than a sweeping statement.

#### Matrimonial Liabilities to be Deducted

35     Although the Parties provided a list of their liabilities in their respective Affidavits of Assets at Means, neither sought to have them deducted or satisfied from the pool of matrimonial assets.[^18] As such, the pool of matrimonial assets for division stood at **$87,997.68**.

#### Wife’s Rental Deposit

36     The Wife sought a refund of her contribution to the security deposit for the first rental property the Parties resided in prior to the rented matrimonial home in \[Rental Property 1\]. She claimed that the Parties contributed $4,300.00 each in December 2013. She alleged that this amount was subsequently rolled over and used as the security deposit for the \[Rental Property 1\] rental in December 2015.[^19] The Wife’s counsel went further to hypothesise that the Wife’s contribution could have been used for the Husband’s security deposit at his new rental premises at \[Rental Property 2\]. The Husband’s counsel rejected the Wife’s claim and provided documentary evidence that the rental deposit for the \[Rental Property 1\] rental originated from a loan taken by the Husband for that specific purpose.[^20] I was accordingly not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the Wife had made out a case or basis for a refund. At the hearing on 25 November 2020, the Wife’s counsel clarified that this was not a loan. Further, her claim that her contribution in December 2013 was rolled over to be used as the security deposit for the \[Rental Property 1\] rental was against the weight of the evidence.

### Just and Equitable Division of the Matrimonial Pool of Assets

37     Section 112(1) of the Women’s Charter empowers the court when granting or subsequent to the grant of a judgment of divorce to order the division between the parties of any matrimonial asset or the sale of any such asset and the division between the parties of the proceeds of the sale of any such asset in such proportions as the court thinks _just and equitable_. The guiding principles of exercising this power are set out in s. 112(2) of the Women’s Charter. In its decision in _ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span> (“_ANJ v ANK_”), the Court of Appeal laid out a structured approach for the division of matrimonial assets. However, in their subsequent decision in _TNL v TNK_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 1 SLR 609</span> at \[46\], the Court of Appeal took the view that the structured approach in _ANJ v ANK_ should not be applied to single-income marriages.

38     The Parties could not agree whether the Parties’ marriage was a dual-income or single-income marriage. At the hearing on 30 October 2020, the Husband’s counsel submitted that the marriage was largely a single-income marriage. The Wife’s counsel did not disagree. However, at the next tranche on 25 November 2020, the Husband’s counsel sought to revisit this issue and argued that it was _not_ a single-income marriage. Further Written Submissions were filed by the Husband to canvass this. The Husband argued that the Wife worked at some points during the marriage and it was disputed that the Wife was the Child’s primary caregiver and there was no clarity on the Parties’ roles during the marriage. The Husband’s counsel however rightly accepted that the Wife was not a breadwinner and that the financial capacity of the marriage resided with the Husband. I found this change of position rather curious since the Husband stated in his initial Written Submissions that the marriage is akin to a single-income marriage and that it was not disputed that the Husband had been the main breadwinner or sole financial provider and had used his income to maintain the family whilst the Wife used her earnings towards her own expenditure.[^21] I did not accept the Husband’s change of position as his initial admission was clearly consistent with the weight of the evidence before me.

39     I was mindful of the trends and case precedents cited in the High Court decision in _UBM v UBN_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 921</span> for single-income marriages but I was of the view that it was unhelpful to rely on them _in the circumstances_ of the present case since the Wife was employed prior to the marriage in 2014, returned to the workforce after she left the matrimonial home in 2016, and the assets reflected in her name for the purposes of ancillary reliefs essentially arose from her employment. I was consequently cognisant that the general rule articulated by the Court of Appeal in _ANJ v ANK_ at \[27\], though made in the context of the structured approach, ought to apply in the circumstances of this case – indirect contributions in general tend to feature more prominently in long marriages, and conversely, indirect contributions usually play a _de minimis_ role in short, childless marriages. I therefore took the view that the direct contributions made by each Party should feature prominently in the division of matrimonial assets in the circumstance of this case and adjustments would be made thereafter to take into account the Parties’ indirect contributions.

40     As neither Party claimed any credit for direct contributions made to the assets in the opposing Party’s name, the direct contributions ratio pertaining to the pool of matrimonial assets stood at **84.14:15.86** in favour of the Wife:

41     During the hearing on 25 November 2020, the Husband’s counsel argued that there should be no adjustments made to the division ratio derived from the direct contributions of the Parties in view of the Parties’ short marriage and reminded the court of the extensive care provided by the Husband towards the Child. The were no Written Submissions from the Wife on this issue though her counsel sought an uplift during the hearing to account for the Wife’s indirect contributions.

42     I adopted a broad-brush approach as decided and observed by the Court of Appeal in _USB v USA_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 2 SLR 588</span> at \[43\] – \[46\] for the assessment of the Parties’ indirect contributions. The Parties’ individual indirect contributions towards the marriage were immense. I have no doubt, especially given the lengths that each took _at every available opportunity_ to canvass in their numerous affidavits and submissions (both oral and written) in the past five years of litigation; the Husband provided significant indirect financial contributions as the breadwinner of the family and the Wife provided significant indirect non-financial contributions through her close care of the Child until the marriage broke down. As such, I was of the view that their indirect contributions were equal.

43     In light of the above, I found it fair and equitable that no adjustments be made to the division ratio derived from their direct contributions and ordered it to be the overall division ratio for the pool of matrimonial assets. To achieve the division ratio of **84.14:15.86** in favour of the Wife, I ordered each Party to retain their respective assets that were in their sole names.

## Wife’s Maintenance

44     The Wife submitted for spousal maintenance against the Husband. Her counsel argued that maintenance was appropriate since she was set back in her earning capacity when she was primarily a homemaker and given the circumstances that she was evicted from the matrimonial home. I noted however that there was no concrete attempt made by the Wife in her Written Submissions to quantify her case for maintenance. The Husband submitted that there should not be maintenance for the Wife in light of the brief length of the marriage, her age, qualifications, and employment history.[^22]

45     The court’s power to order maintenance is supplementary to its power to order a division of matrimonial assets. _ATE v ATD and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGCA 2</span> at \[33\]. As such, the court must take into account each party’s share of the matrimonial assets. Further, in determining the amount of maintenance to be paid, the court must have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the factors listed out in s. 114(1) of the Women’s Charter and that the court shall endeavour to place the parties as far as it is practicable in the financial position in which they would have been if the marriage had not broken down and each had properly discharged his or her financial obligations and responsibilities toward the other.

46     I found no merit in the Wife’s submission for maintenance. She is to receive a significant majority share of the pool of matrimonial assets and this was a short marriage of four and a half years. It was especially shorter given that the marriage breakdown occurred in 2016, just two years after the commencement of their union. Her time out of employment was similarly short, around one and a half years. After the marriage, she left her employment in July 2015[^23] and she returned to the workforce immediately after she was asked to leave the matrimonial home in November 2016. It was also clear that the Wife had more than adequate earning capacity to support herself, drawing a monthly salary of $4,160.00 and incurring monthly expenses of $3,021.00.[^24] For completeness, I did not find the Wife’s eviction from the matrimonial home to be relevant to issue of spousal maintenance.

## Child’s Maintenance

47     The Husband was detailed in his proposal[^25] for the Child’s maintenance, which facilitated the following summarised agreement being recorded between the Parties:

> (a)     The Parties to claim reimbursement from their own company’s group or individual medical policy for the Child’s medical expenses. If it is not claimable/reimbursable, the Wife and the Husband shall bear those expenses in the proportion of 16:84 respectively;

> (b)     The Husband to bear the Child’s school fees; and

> (c)     The Husband to bear the Child’s vaccination expenses.

48     The Parties however could not agree on the demarcation of their responsibilities when it came to the Child’s school apparel, school trips and enrichment classes. With regard to the latter, the Child was attending Mandarin and swimming classes as at the time of the hearing. The Husband sought for each Party to maintain the Child while the Child is under their respective care and control, including any enrichment classes during their time, and for the Parties to share the costs of the Child’s school trips equally. The Husband took particular issue with the Child being enrolled in Mandarin classes without his consent and he was not enthusiastic in paying for those classes. The Wife sought for these expenses to be borne by the Husband solely.

49     The power to order children’s maintenance in ancillary matters is provided for in s. 127 of the Women’s Charter, with the factors to be considered by the court provided in s. 69(4). The Husband was fortunate to be in a significantly more advantageous earning capacity, approximately six times more, than the Wife and he rightfully offered to cover a significant portion of the Child’s expenses. As such, he should have been more magnanimous by also covering the Child’s school apparel and types of enrichment classes that the Child was already attending (_i.e._ Mandarin and swimming classes). I ordered him to do so accordingly. For future additional enrichment classes, I found it fair in the circumstances for the Party enrolling the Child for that activity to be solely responsible for those expenses.

50     In light of the significant responsibility of the Child’s expenses being shouldered by the Husband, I found it residually fair for the Parties to maintain the Child while she is under their respective care and control. As overseas trips organised by the Child’s school are likely to be _ad hoc_ expenses that will in the ordinary course of nature bring joy to the Child, I ordered the Parties to share equally in those costs so that both of them will appear equally supportive to the Child as she pursues those learning opportunities.

## Conclusion

51     At the conclusion of the hearing, the Wife submitted for costs in the amount of $5,000.00 for the Director of Legal Aid and the Husband sought for costs in the same amount. Unsurprisingly, counsel for both Parties focused their efforts on the unreasonableness of the litigation conducted by the Party opposite. I agreed with both of them. Much time and resources were expended by the Parties because of their acrimony and distrust for one another. On balance, I found the Wife’s conduct to be marginally more egregious and I therefore ordered costs fixed at $1,000.00 against her. Specifically, the Wife unnecessarily prolonged these proceedings by adopting positions on spousal maintenance and the division of matrimonial assets, particularly on the allegations of dissipation against the Husband and the Husband’s United Kingdom property, that were without merit.

52     When a marriage breaks down, spouses tend to see the very worst in each other during divorce proceedings. Fortunately, many appreciate the harm that acrimonious proceedings can do to their children and find it within themselves to resolve matters amicably. It is unfortunate that the Parties in this matter could not find it within themselves to do so and both continue to harbour distrust for one another. I ordered both of them to go for counselling (again)[^26] and I hope that, with the conclusion of the divorce proceedings, they can return to seeing the good that the Party opposite can provide to their Child.
