Family Law – Maintenance for Wife and child

7 February 2020

### District Judge Christine Lee:

### Introduction

1       There are two cross appeals in this case. The first appeal is by the Husband in DCA 139 of 2019 against the whole of the Court’s decision in the Court Order dated 24 October 2019 regarding maintenance payments by the Husband to the Wife and the child from the Wife’s previous marriage.

2       The second appeal is by the Wife in DCA 149 of 2019 against the part of the Court’s decision in the same Court Order dated 24 October 2019 regarding the commencement date of the Husband’s maintenance payments for the Wife and the child.

### Background Facts

3       The Wife and Husband married on xx xxx 2014 in Singapore. There are no children from the marriage. However, the Wife has a child from her previous marriage namely, \[B\] (m) DOB xx xxx 2006, aged 13 years at the time of the maintenance hearings (“the said child”). Coincidentally the Wife’s surname was the same as the Husband’s so that was also the surname of the said child[^1].

4       On the first day of the maintenance hearings, the Court ascertained that the Husband had filed Writ of Divorce on 9 May 2018 in D xxxx/2018 and that Interim Judgement had been granted on 29 May 2019 but that the Ancillary Matters had yet to be dealt with[^2]. Hence, the Wife submitted that she still required interim maintenance from the Husband for herself and the said child under section 69 of the Women’s Charter.

### Hearings before the Court

5       The Court dealt with the Wife’s application for maintenance for herself and the said child on two hearing days namely, 6 September 2019 and 24 October 2019 whereupon the Court delivered its decision.

6       The Husband filed Notice of Appeal on 31 October 2019 in HCF/DCA 139/2019 against the whole of the Court Order issued on 24 October 2019 (“the said Court Order”) regarding the maintenance payments to be made by the Husband for the Wife and the said child.

7       The Wife filed Notice of Appeal on 7 November 2019 in HCF/DCA 149/2019 against one paragraph of the said Court Order regarding the commencement date of the maintenance payments by the Husband.

### The Appeals

8       The Husband’s appeal and the Wife’s appeal are with regard to the provisions of the said Court Order set out below:

> **DCA 139/2019 appeal by the Husband**

> 1.    VFY is to pay to VFZ a total of $800.00 per month as maintenance for VFZ and for the child, namely \[B\]. The above-mentioned sum comprises:

>> a.    $500.00 per month for VFZ; and

>> b.    $300.00 per month for \[B\].

> 2.    The above-mentioned maintenance is to be paid from 01 November 2018 and thereafter on or before the 1st day of each month.

> 3.    VFY is to make payment of the above-mentioned amounts into VFZ's UNITED OVERSEAS BANK LIMITED Account number xxx.

> **DCA 149/2019 appeal by the Wife**

> 2.    The above-mentioned maintenance is to be paid from 01 November 2018 and thereafter on or before the 1st day of each month.

### Summary of the Court’s reasons for making its Order

## Appeal by the Husband

9       Before making its decision on the maintenance payments by the Husband, the Court ascertained the basis for the Wife’s application. The Wife testified that she had applied under section 69(1) of the Women’s Charter for maintenance for herself in the monthly sum of $500.00 with effect from June 2018, to assist the Wife with her rental expenses[^3].

10     The Wife explained that although the Husband had moved out of the matrimonial home in February 2018, she had initially continued to stay in the matrimonial home with the said child. The Wife testified that she subsequently moved out of the matrimonial home in June 2018 because of the way the Husband had behaved and the message that he had sent her on 27 April 2018[^4], which had made her feel unsafe. The Wife elaborated that the Husband had threatened that he would change the locks of the matrimonial home and that he had previously destroyed her things. As such, she thought that the Husband would “do something bad”[^5] to her and the said child and she moved out of the matrimonial home because she was concerned for her and the said child’s safety.

11     The Wife further testified that she had moved into a condominium at the initial monthly rental of $2,200.00 which was reduced to $2,000.00[^6] by the time of maintenance hearings. When questioned by the Husband as to why she chose to move into a condominium which costs rental of over $2,000.00 instead of a Housing Development Board (HDB) rental flat which would be cheaper, the Wife explained that the condominium was directly opposite the said child’s school and it had badminton and swimming facilities which the said child could utilise[^7].

12     In addition, the Wife testified that, by the time of the maintenance hearings, she had been terminated from her employment with effect from 28 February 2019[^8]. The Wife produced documentary evidence of the termination and the Husband did not dispute this[^9]. The Wife also testified that her parents were subsidising her rental and living expenses[^10] as she could not rely on income from her side business, which was a florist business, because it was not a profitable business at the time[^11].

13     The Court also considered the reasons given by the Husband for refusing to pay maintenance for the Wife and the said child, as summarised below:

> (i)     That the Wife had a full time job and a florist business. However, under cross-examination, the Husband accepted that the Wife was no longer employed as she had been terminated from her job in February 2019[^12].

> (ii)     The Husband said that the Wife should get another job although the Wife had testified that she was working at the florist business full time and was trying to turn it around. Under cross-examination, the Husband also accepted that the florist business was not making any money at the time[^13].

> (iii)     The Husband also took issue with the fact that the Wife was staying in a condominium at the rental of $2,000.00 per month whereas he was sharing a HDB flat with his father and 3 other people[^14].

14     However, the Court noted that the Husband also gave the reason that his monthly expenses were more than his take home pay. Under cross-examination, the Husband admitted that his annual income was $83,967.00 which if divided by 12 months = $6,997.00 per month. Even if divided by 13 months as proposed by the Husband, this would mean that the Husband’s assessable income was $6,459.00 per month[^15]. This was more than the income that he had declared in Exhibit R1, which was a gross income of $5,700.00 and nett income of $4,560.00 per month.

15     The Court also noted that the Husband was not forthcoming about his financial capacity as he appeared to have increased his declared expenses. In his monthly expenses form produced in Exhibit R1, the Husband declared that his monthly expenses were in the sum of $4,750.00. However, under cross-examination, the Husband admitted that $1,200.00 of this amount was actually being deducted from his CPF so his total monthly expenses should be $3,550.00 per month[^16]. Even using the lower figure of the Husband’s declared nett income of $4,560.00, this would give the Husband an excess of $1,010.00 per month as disposable income (being $4,560.00 - $3,550.00).

16     Under further cross-examination, the Husband also admitted that he had recorded a sum of $1,000.00 under the credit cards column when this was already included in the first column under “Night Class”[^17]. Thus, this additional $1,000.00 increased the Husband’s disposable income to $2,010.00 per month.

17     The Court further noted that from the time the Husband had regained full access to the matrimonial home in November 2018, the Husband chose not to rent out the matrimonial home[^18]. Instead, the Husband chose to leave the matrimonial home “as a warehouse”[^19]. In this regard, the Court was referred to the WhatsApp message which the Husband had sent to the Wife as produced at page 13 of Exhibit C1.

18     The Court also took note that the Husband had made an application both at the commencement of and during the maintenance hearings, to produce video clips for his case. When asked by the Court as to why these video clips were relevant and necessary for the hearing, the Husband informed that the video clips were to show the existence of a male person alleged to have stayed with the Wife in the matrimonial home after the Husband had moved out.

19     The Husband maintained that he was not liable to pay maintenance for the Wife and the said child as the Wife had incurred rental expenses because this male person had stayed in the matrimonial home in breach of the Husband’s conditions[^20]. The Court disallowed these video clips on the ground that the existence or otherwise of this person was not relevant to the maintenance hearing.

20     The Court considered all the reasons raised by the Husband and came to the conclusion that these reasons were not justifiable and that the Husband had neglected and/or refused to pay reasonable interim maintenance for the Wife and the said child.

21      Maintenance for the Wife: The Court was of the view that the Wife’s application for maintenance for herself was reasonable for the following reasons:

> a.     The Wife was still seeking the sum of $500.00 per month at the maintenance hearings as per her application made in April 2019 despite the fact that she had been terminated from her employment at least six months prior to the hearings.

> b.     The Husband had accepted that the Wife had been terminated from her job in February 2019 and that her florist business was not making a profit at the time of the maintenance hearings.

> c.     The sum of $500.00 per month was within the Husband’s capacity to pay, based on his disposable income and the fact that he chose not to rent out the matrimonial home even though he admitted that he had full access to the matrimonial home since November 2018. Such rental could have provided the Wife with a source of income to assist the Wife with her monthly expenses as she was still a co-owner of the matrimonial home.

22     In the Court’s view, the institution of marriage was a contract agreed to by the Husband and Wife to support each other, especially in time of need. Although the Husband and Wife were undergoing a divorce, this had not yet reached the stage of the ancillary matters hearing. The Court’s assessment of the Wife’s testimony was that she was a credible witness and she had a genuine need for the Husband to make the requested maintenance payment in the sum of $500.00 per month to help the Wife defray her monthly financial needs and not just her rental expenses alone.

23      Maintenance for the said child: The Wife had also applied under section 69(2) of the Women’s Charter for maintenance for the said child in the monthly sum of $300.00 with effect from December 2017. The Wife chose the date of December 2017 as that was when the Wife said that the Husband had stopped contributing for the said child’s expenses.

24     When the Husband cross-examined the Wife and asked her to describe his relationship with the said child, the Wife testified that the Husband and the said child had got along well and that the Husband had been a father figure to the said child[^21] during their marriage. The Husband did not dispute this. In fact, the Husband agreed that he had raised and looked after the said child from the time he was married to the Wife in early 2014 until the day he left the matrimonial home in February 2018[^22]. Under cross-examination, the Husband also admitted that he had bought toys and cared for the said child[^23].

25     The Court was of the view that under section 70 of the Women’s Charter, the Husband was liable to pay maintenance for the said child because the Husband had accepted and treated the said child as a member of his family during his marriage to the Wife for over 3 years and since the said child was 7 years old[^24].

26     The Court assessed that the Husband’s liability to pay maintenance for the said child is based on the case law principle that the marriage between the Husband and Wife was an equal cooperative partnership and this includes the responsibility to share the expenses of raising the said child together.

27     The Court also took into account the fact that there had been a breakdown of the marriage between the Husband and Wife. However, the Court was of the view that this did not mean that there was to be an immediate cessation of the Husband’s responsibility towards the said child even though he was the non-biological parent and the Wife had the primary responsibility of maintaining the said child.

28     As there was no evidence that the biological father of the said child was paying any money towards the said child’s maintenance, the Court was of the view that, on the facts of this case, the burden of maintaining the said child should not rest solely on the Wife, especially since she had lost her full-time job.

29     In the Court’s view, and until the ancillary matters related to the marriage was dealt with, as the sum of $300.00 per month requested by the Wife for the said child was reasonable, based on the said child’s estimated monthly expenses, the Husband should pay this amount of $300.00 as interim monthly maintenance for the said child. This additional sum of $300.00 per month was also within the Husband’s capacity to pay based on his disposable income.

30     In his appeal, the Husband has also disputed the effective date of the maintenance to be paid to the Wife and the said child regarding the Court ordered date of 1 November 2018. Since the Wife’s appeal is on this sole issue, the Court will deal with this under the Wife’s appeal.

## Appeal by the Wife

31     The Court noted that the Wife’s application for maintenance for herself was to be backdated to June 2018 as that was the date that she had moved out of the matrimonial home. The Wife had used the date of December 2017 for the said child, as that was the date that the Wife said that the Husband had stopped contributing to the said child’s expenses.

32     Regarding the effective date of the maintenance payments to the Wife, the Court noted that the Wife had moved out of the matrimonial home in June 2018, as she claimed that she was concerned for her safety and that of the said child because of the Husband’s threat to her. However, this threat was made on 27 April 2018[^25].

33     In the Court’s view, had the Wife been as concerned for her safety and that of the said child, she would not have waited for more than one month to move out of the matrimonial home. The Court also noted that at the time, the Wife was still holding a full-time job as well as running her florist business.

34     With regard to the said child, the Court was of the view that although the Wife was the parent who had the primary responsibility of maintaining the said child, there was not to be immediate cessation of the Husband’s responsibility to share the expenses for the said child.

35     The Court also noted that the Husband had testified that his position had not changed although he accepted that the Wife had been terminated from her job in February 2019 and that her florist business was not profitable[^26].

36     However, the Court was also of the view that the Husband should only be liable for both the Wife’s and the said child’s maintenance from the date that he regained full access to the matrimonial home. This was because, having regained full access to the matrimonial home, the Husband chose to leave it empty and not to rent it out, which would have provided the Wife with some financial assistance from November 2018.

37     On a balance of all these factors, the Court assessed that the Husband’s liability to pay maintenance for the Wife and the said child should commence on 1 November 2018.

### Conclusion

38     The Court of Appeal stated in the case of _Foo Ah Yan v Chiam Heng Chow_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 2 SLR 506</span>, that the objective of section 69 applications is to provide the Wife with a reasonable quantum of maintenance to help her overcome her immediate financial needs having regard to all the circumstances of the case. The “immediate financial needs” approach was adopted because section 69 applications are not final maintenance applications which is only after the divorce is finalised.

39     Therefore, in considering the Wife’s application, the Court took into account the key factor of the Wife’s financial situation, noting that her parents were helping her out with some of her expenses and in particular the fact that she had been terminated from her full time job in February 2019. The Court also noted that although the Wife was focussing on her florist business, this business was not doing well at the time. The Court took into account the Husband’s submission that the Wife was a University Degree holder and capable of getting a well-paying job. However, the Court was of the view that it was the Court’s duty to consider the Wife’s immediate financial needs as at the hearing of her maintenance application.

40     The Court was also of the view that the Court had a duty to consider the said child’s needs. The Husband admitted that he had cared for and paid for the said child’s expenses during the marriage when the Husband and Wife were living together. The Husband also did not deny that he had had a good relationship with the said child. Accordingly, the Court was satisfied that the provisions of section 70 of the Women’s Charter were fulfilled and that the Husband was liable to pay maintenance for the said child.

41     As the Court was also of the view that there should not be an immediate cessation of the Husband’s responsibility towards the said child, the Court ordered that the Husband should pay for the said child’s monthly maintenance. This was intended to continue until the ancillary matters related to the marriage were dealt with. The Court was ultimately guided by the principle of what was in the best interests of the welfare of the said child.

42     Finally, the Court also considered the factor of the Husband’s’ financial situation and his capacity to pay maintenance for the Wife and the said child. Upon consideration of all the facts produced at the maintenance hearings, the Court was of the view that the total sum of $800.00 per month as maintenance for the Wife and the said child with effect from 1 November 2018, was fair and reasonable.
