Care And Control Over Child

21 October 2020

### District Judge Toh Wee San:

1       These were two applications filed under two different OSG. One was filed by the husband (H) and another by the wife (W) over the custody and care for their almost two year old son (the child). After hearing them, I made my orders in Annex A. Under OSG 121/2019, the plaintiff husband (H) filed an appeal against the entirety of my decision and I now set out the grounds for my decision.

## Facts

2       Parties married in March 2018 and a son (the child) was born in September 2018. After the child was born, parties started to have a lot of issues with each other and over the care of the child. The couple were in deep acrimony and H filed multiple police reports against the defendant wife (W). One specific incident was H alleged that W had threatened him with a kitchen-knife (the knife incident) and H lodged a police report against her. This led to W being brought to IMH for review. The diagnosis from IMH was W suffered from “acute stress reaction due to on-going relationship issues” then but was otherwise well with no mental illness. Around March 2019, W moved out with the child when H was overseas for work. When H returned from overseas, he filed a missing person report with the police to trace W and the child.

3       H and W are around 50 and 43 years old respectively this year. H and the child are Singapore citizens. W is a Malaysian citizen and Singapore permanent resident (SPR). W was a housewife during the marriage and only started working in October 2019. H was an interior designer. H stayed in the matrimonial home at Bedok while W and the child stayed in a rented room at Woodlands. The child attended a childcare centre in Woodlands but it did not work out. The child was subsequently cared for by a professional nanny since October 2019 when W went back to work.

4       After W left with the child, parties continued to have problems with access. Subsequently, there were 4 court orders made in respect of maintenance and access issues. In short, H was ordered to pay monthly maintenance for the child and W. H also started a round of supervised access to the child at the authorised centre. The court received positive feedback about the progress made by H. Parties subsequently agreed for H to see the child accompanied by a person approved by W every Sunday for a few hours. Though no affidavit was filed, I was informed by H’s counsel that W also accompanied H and the child for access during the circuit breaker period. On some occasions when W was not available, H had access to the child on his own. Meanwhile parties filed their present applications. Both wanted to be the care parent for the child. I set out their reasons below.

## The parties’ cases in brief

5       H applied for sole or shared care and control over the child so that H can maintain “status quo” for the child. H argued that this meant the child can:

> a)     maintain a home in the matrimonial flat;

> b)     be cared for by his own father;

> c)     have a daily routine back to normal;

> d)     have acceptable hours without undue exposure incurred by unnecessary movements;

> e)     seek help from H for his schoolwork; and

> f)     be protected from further damage emotionally or otherwise by W

6       Most of all, H submitted that he missed his child and he had been taking care of the child. W’s action in removing the child abruptly from H and the child’s familiar surroundings were motivated by malice and ill intentions. W should not be permitted to disrupt the child’s life in such a manner for her own selfish and vengeful reasons. Until compelled by the court orders, W refused to allow H any physical contact with the child. W was hyper-critical of H’s parenting efforts. W should not be allowed to have sole care over the child just because she was the female parent. A father was an equal parent and should be accorded the same opportunity to raise his child.

7       In addition H brought up the “knife incident” described under paragraph two above and submitted that W was not suited to care for the child. W had not provided any satisfactory explanation for her conduct. The medical report and diagnosis of “acute stress reaction” stood in isolation. H’s counsel informed me that they asked W and her doctor to answer further questions arising from this incident, but W declined to do so. To avoid protracting the proceeding and inflating the costs, H did not pursue further. The police did not prosecute W, but issued a stern warning to her instead. In conclusion, H asked for

> a.     joint custody and sole care over the child from Tuesday 7 pm to Saturday 7 pm as well as alternate public holiday, parent’s day access and joint access with W on the child’s birthday.

> b.     the telephone and email address of the child’s nanny/childcare centre. The choice of caregiver for the child has to be agreed by both sides.

> c.     the details of pickup and how the caregiver should contact the parent for emergencies.

> d.     restricted overseas travel for the child with W as W was a flight risk, due to her overseas nationality.

> e.     to keep the child’s passport.

7       W applied for sole care over the child and supervised access for H. The visits shall be supervised by the persons agreed by both sides. The reasons were case law suggested that all things being equal, CC of a young infant would usually be granted to the mother. In the present instance, things were not equal as W was the primary caregiver to the child since his birth. W was more familiar with the intricacies of the child. W also argued that shared care was not feasible because parties had an extremely tumultuous relationship and the lack of cooperation was likely to be harmful to the child.

8       W elaborated on her contributions as the child’s primary caregiver. She was a first timer mother at 41 years old. As the child was likely to be her only child, she had stopped working since conceiving the child. W took care of the child single-handedly since birth from bathing, coaxing the child to sleep, reading up on infant care, buying suitable toys, doing all the child’s daily tasks, researching the childcare centre, nanny and bringing the child to the doctor when the child was unwell. H did not dispute these but claimed that W was only able to do so with his support. W also pointed out that H did not take any leave for the first 2.5 months since the baby’s birth. H only took Fridays off for about 4 months starting from 3rd month old after the child was born. W alleged that H had used the time for himself, having movie marathons and updating his food blog. Even when H returned home after work, he spent the evenings doing his own things. Though W was a Malaysian and her family members lived overseas, she had a lot of support in Singapore such as her church mates. The child was thriving under her care. H rebutted her evidence by explaining that he was not around during the initial phase after the child’s birth as W’s mother was supposed to assist W on a permanent basis but fell out with W and was asked to leave. H countered that W was the primary care-giver by virtue of her own action of rejecting help from H and her own mother.

9       W submitted that shared care was not feasible as the child was still very young and highly attached and dependent on her. W also argued that it was widely accepted that the mother’s care had positive effects on the child. More-ever parties were highly conflicted, as seen from the multiple police reports filed by H which W deemed to be baseless. W also denied H’s accusations against her that she had mental illness and suicidal thoughts. Re the knife incident under paragraph 2, W countered that she had been diagnosed and certified by IMH to be of sound mind and she had suffered from acute stress reaction due to the conflicts with H. W reported that even after all these, H refused to bring her home from IMH initially until he could no longer hide this matter from W’s father who wanted to visit them in person. W opined that H had mental health issues and brought up examples to show how aggressive he could be, even before outsiders from the public agencies. H contested that he was aggressive without reason and countered that W had behaved badly herself on those instances before the public authorities.

10     W submitted that H was not familiar with the intricacies of child care. She provided various examples of how H was not able to physically care for the child properly. She also gave details on why she found H’s flat and the surrounding to be unsuitable for the child. For example, there were glass mirrors, no window grills in the flat and burning of incense and making of offerings held near the flat. H worked full time, sometimes on weekends and travelled for work. H was also a food blogger and not close to his adopted family. The child was cared for by a nanny in Woodlands when the parents were at work. This was a far distance from H’s flat in Bedok. W cited several caselaw to show that for young infants, it is in the best interest of the child for the child to be cared for by the mother. For parties in deep conflict, shared care was not suitable. W informed that she has been working in Singapore since 2001 and had been a permanent resident since 2003. She wish to apply for citizenship once she has a higher income. Hence she denied that she was a flight risk and wanted to bring the child to visit her family members residing overseas. The child was a citizen of Singapore and would be educated and serve National Service in Singapore. In conclusion, W proposed supervised or accompanied access to H and unsupervised access only after the child turns 2.5 years old or until H undergoes a psychiatric assessment to confirm that he has no mental health issues. W further proposed overnight access only after H employs a domestic helper to assist with overnight access. H disagreed that he was not close to his family and countered that W similarly was alone without familial support in Singapore. He also contested the suitability of W’s accommodation for the child.

## Issue to be determined

11     What will be the most appropriate CC arrangement for the child?

## Decision and reasons

12     I applied the relevant laws[^1] and ordered that the child be placed under W’s care while granting reasonable access to H. I ordered that H be permitted to see the child for four days weekly. H shall have access to the child up to three times from 7 pm to 9 pm on weekdays and 9 am to 5 pm on Saturdays (albeit incrementally). It was clear to me that H loved the child very much and I wanted to allow sufficient access for him to bond with the child. I elaborate further on my reasons below.

13     The child is no longer an infant. He is now close to 2 years old and it will be easier for H to care for a toddler. Hence I was not persuaded by W’s submission to grant supervised access to H. W’s past issues or concerns over H’s ability to care for an infant is no longer as pressing. It was expected that W being a female and mother, will be more skilled at looking after the child. However it was equally important to allow H to bond with the child. Given that both parents are working, the child has to be cared for by a day-care provider during working hours. Nevertheless as the child is only about two years old and W was his primary caregiver since birth, it is natural for the child to be close and attached to W. This was not disputed by H. I was persuaded that it would be in the child’s best interest for W to continue to be the child’s care parent at this point in time. I hope that parties will be able to better cooperate and support each other in future and take on shared care duties for the child.

14     W’s action of taking the child away with her, in H’s absence is not condoned. How-ever W also provided her side of the story. In short, W found H’s behaviour towards her to be harassing and intolerable. She was unable to stay with him anymore and leaving him was the only way out for her. Hence she took the baby and left. While parties had issues cooperating initially, they had made positive progress despite the on-going acrimony. They will need to continue to work on it for the sake of their child. As for W’s mental health, the psychiatrist from IMH had given an objective opinion that W was of sound mind. H did not bring opposing evidence to challenge the psychiatrist’s evidence. The police also closed the case without prosecuting W. In conclusion, I am satisfied that W is fit to care for the child.

15     I was not persuaded that joint care is a good idea for now. It was clear that parties’ relationship was rapidly deteriorating after the birth of the child. Shared care was not feasible as parties were highly hostile towards each other. I foresee great difficulties for cooperation. How-ever as explained above, I agreed that it was important for H to have sufficient bonding time with the child and hence I ordered a very frequent weekly access plan for H. As the child was still young, I ordered H to see the child at W’s residential area to avoid excessive travels for the child. I also urged parties to attend the counselling and work towards a more cordial relationship so as to make co-parenting work effectively.

16     At the hearing, I required H to take steps to child proof his house and keep W posted. I ordered W to provide the day care provider’s name and contact address, but H shall not contact the provider without W’s consent since W was the care parent. As W has been in Singapore for many years, I was not persuaded that W was a flight risk. Instead, I ordered both to take turns to keep the child’s passport.

## Conclusion

17     I hope that parties can put the unhappy past behind, learn from the counselling programs and co-parent together. I also ordered no costs against either side since both did not get what they applied for squarely.
