Family Law – Ancillary Matters – section 112 & 113 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353)

16 October 2019

### District Judge Cheryl Koh:

## A.    Introduction

1       These are the ancillary matters arising out of a divorce involving two issues: the division of matrimonial assets and maintenance for the plaintiff wife (the “**Wife**”).

2       On 02 July 2019, I awarded the Wife with 53% of the matrimonial pool and the defendant husband (the **“Husband**”) with 47%. With a lump sum maintenance of $10,000.00 awarded to the Wife, this translated to her receiving 67% of their matrimonial home.

3       The Wife has appealed against the division of matrimonial assets (including the division of the matrimonial home). The Husband has appealed against the whole of my decision.

## B.    Background facts

4       Parties were married on 6 January 1998. The Wife commenced divorce proceedings on 12 July 2017. Interim Judgment was granted on 27 February 2018. The marriage therefore lasted 20 years. There are two (2) children to the marriage, a girl aged 19 years and a boy aged 17 years.

5       The Husband is 44 years old and currently unemployed. The Wife is 48 years old and working as a Sales Co-ordinator.

6       By consent, the following ancillary matters orders were granted on 27 February 2018:

> (a)     the Husband and the Wife shall have joint custody of both children with care and control to the Wife;

> (b)     the Husband shall have reasonable access to the children;

> (c)     the Husband shall pay the Wife a monthly sum of $300.00 for the maintenance of their daughter. When the daughter commences full time studies, the maintenance sum shall increase to $600.00 and Husband shall further pay for the daughter’s polytechnic fees using his CPF monies; and

> (d)     the Husband shall pay to the Wife a monthly sum of $100.00 for the maintenance of their son, and the maintenance sum shall increase to $300.00 with effect from 01 March 2018.

7       Following the said consent order, the only outstanding ancillary matters to be decided by the Court were the division of matrimonial assets (including the matrimonial home) and maintenance for the Wife.

8       The affidavits and submissions filed by the parties are as follows:

> (a)     the Wife’s 1st Affidavit of Assets and Means (“**AOM**”) filed on 30 April 2018;

> (b)     the Wife’s 2nd AOM filed on 22 April 2019;

> (c)     the Wife’s 3rd AOM filed on 21 May 2019;

> (d)     the Husband’s 1st AOM filed on 16 August 2018;

> (e)     the Husband’s 2nd AOM filed on 3 May 2019;

> (f)     the Husband’s Submissions dated 18 June 2019; and

> (g)     the Wife’s Submissions dated 14 June 2019.

## C.    Grounds of Decision

9       Both counsel agreed that the structured approach espoused in the Court of Appeal decision of _ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span> is to be used for the purpose of dividing the matrimonial assets. This meant that the following steps are to be considered in the division:

> (a)     to delineate the matrimonial pool, making clear the date to be used for such assessment;

> (b)     to ascribe a ratio that represents each party’s direct financial contributions relative to the other party;

> (c)     to decide a ratio that represents each party’s indirect contributions;

> (d)     to derive each party’s average percentage contributions; and

> (e)     further adjustments to the weightage of the direct and contribution contributions, or to shift the average ratio.

10     Both counsel further agreed that the date of division of matrimonial assets would be the date of the Interim Judgment, which is 27 February 2018.

### Value of the matrimonial pool

11     Parties largely do not dispute the value of the matrimonial pool. I find the same to amount to around $990,677.37, computed as follows:

### Direct contributions to the matrimonial home

12     I found that the Wife contributed around 60% to the net value of the matrimonial home, calculated as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="17.76%"> <col width="15.88%"> <col width="16.84%"> <col width="49.52%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><u>Item</u></b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><u>The Wife’s position (S$)</u></b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><u>The Husband’s position (S$)</u></b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><u>The Court’s finding (S$)</u></b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">The Wife’s CPF contribution</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">38,886.67</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">38,886.67</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">38,886.67 (agreed)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">The Wife’s cash contribution</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">357,319.67</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">NIL</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">For the reasons discussed at [13] to [15] below, I found that the sum of $246,340.80 ($60,0000.00 +$75,361.92 + $110,978.88) is solely attributable to the Wife.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" colspan="3" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Subtotal</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">285,227.47</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(246,340.80 cash + 38,886.67 CPF).</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">This translates to the Wife having contributed towards 59.93% (285,227.47/475,898.05) of the matrimonial home.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">The Husband’s CPF</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">79,691.71</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">79,691.71</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">79,691.71 (agreed)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">The Husband’s Cash</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">----</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">357,319.67</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">For the reasons discussed at [13] to [15] below, I found that the cash sum of $110,978.88 is attributable to the Husband.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" colspan="3" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Subtotal</b></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">190,670.59</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">This translates to the Husband having contributed towards 40.07% (190,670.59/475,898.05) of the matrimonial home.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

13     The only dispute is as to who had contributed the cash payments of $357,319.67 towards the matrimonial home. The Husband accepted that the Wife was the one who had handled the cash payments and these funds came from her sole account; however, he argued that he had given her most of the funds and the income approach (with him as the larger income earner) ought to be applied in determining who had made these cash contributions. The Wife argued that other than her own income, the funds came from loans from her family and liquidation of shares held with her brother.

14     I accepted that the Wife was able to show that she had the following cash resources to pay towards the matrimonial home:

> (a)     two loans of $30,0000.00 each made to her;[^4] and

> (b)     $75,361.92 (half of $150,723.84, which represents the total proceeds from the liquidation of the Wife’s shares held jointly with her brother up to 2016)[^5].

15     I however found that, in the absence of contrary evidence showing the flow of funds from her alleged borrowings into the Wife’s account, it would be fair for the balance cash contribution of $221,957.75 to be attributable equally to both parties ($110,978.88 each), bearing in mind that:

> (a)     parties had received cash proceeds of $130,943.76 from the sale of their previous matrimonial home at the time, and the Wife has not produced any source documents to prove that these cash proceeds did not go into her account as claimed[^6];

> (b)     the Wife accepted that the Husband gave her a monthly sum of up to $800.00 for expenses (although the Husband claimed the monthly sum was much more and had given her over $500,000.00 over the years);

> (c)     the Wife retained all rental income from the renting out of a room in their matrimonial home, from 2009 till todate (previously at least $500.00 per month and now at $1,500.00 per month);

> (d)     the Wife retained all income from her business she ran in 2015 to 2018 amounting to $300 to $500 per month, which the Husband assisted in[^7]; and

> (e)     the Wife (who is currently earning net monthly income of $2,000.00) has always been a lower income earner than the Husband (whose last earned net monthly income was $5,000.00), hence she could not have depended much on her own income to pay towards the purchase price.

### Direct contributions to the matrimonial pool

16     This meant that the Wife made direct contributions of 50.42% to the matrimonial pool, whilst the Husband contributed to the balance 49.58%:

### Indirect contributions

17     The Wife argued that indirect contributions ought to be 70:30 in her favour, whilst the Husband argued that they ought to be 55:45 in his favour. I find that they are 55:45 in favour of the Wife.

18     Both parties claimed to have cared for the children (with the assistance of the Husband’s parents as both parties were working), done the housework and taken care of the household expenses. In terms of indirect financial contributions, the Wife accepted that the Husband gave her at least $600.00 to $800.00 monthly in cash to cover the car instalment with excess for the household and children’s expenses[^8]. She also retained his share of monthly rental income since 2009 till todate to pay for expenses. In terms of indirect non-financial contributions, the Wife accepted that the Husband played the role of a husband and a father for at least the first 10 to 12 years of marriage[^9]. She further admitted that the Husband attended all parent-teacher meetings and parent-support group meetings as she was not highly educated.[^10] As the Wife did not drive, the Husband ferried the children to and from school, his parents’ place and their activities. Ultimately, I find parties’ contributions to be about equal for a long marriage of 20 years. I awarded the Wife a slightly higher percentage of 55%, bearing in mind that she had stood by the Husband and assisted him when he had gotten into debts with moneylenders and loansharks.

### Weightage

19     The Wife argued that the weightage to direct and indirect contributions should be 55:45 in favour of indirect contributions as it is a long marriage. The Husband argued that weightage should be equal. In my view, both parties had worked and played their roles in terms of financial and non-financial contributions in this long marriage. I found no compelling reason or special circumstance to depart from giving equal weightage to both type of contributions.

### Overall ratio

20     Therefore, I found that the Wife is entitled to 52.3% of the value of the matrimonial pool:

21     If neither party is able to takeover the matrimonial home, parties would likely have to surrender it as the Minimum Occupation Period has not yet been fulfilled. In such an event, the Husband should receive cash of approximately $60,756.68 ($143,098.73 less his CPF refund of $82,342.05), on top of his CPF refund. The sum of $60,756.68 represents about 19.24% of surrender proceeds (cash) of $315,790.22 ($438,393 less $82,342.05 and $40,260.73). The Wife should receive cash of approximately $255,033.54 ($295,294.27 less her CPF refund of $40,260.73), on top of her CPF refund. This sum represents about 80.76% of the surrender proceeds (cash) of $315,790.22.

### Adjustments to the final ratio

22     The Wife argued that the final ratio be adjusted in her favour, for the reasons that follow:

> (a)     the Husband has lied on oath (he affirmed on affidavit that he had paid various sums to one Jasmine, but later admitted that they were in fact paid to illegal bookies) [^11];

> (b)     there were suspicious transactions in the Husband’s bank accounts[^12];

> (c)     she assisted him in repaying his debts to moneylenders[^13]; and

> (d)     the Husband solely occupied the matrimonial home from July 2017[^14].

23     I however declined to make any adjustments. The Husband explained that he initially dared not affirm that he had made payments to illegal bookies, as he was afraid they would harm him. The deposits and withdrawals to and from the Husband’s account ranged from a thousand to a few thousand dollars, and were not so frequent or significant to justify any adverse inference. The Husband explained that these sums were with regard to loans and various expenses, and the Wife has chosen not to pursue any discovery. Whilst the Wife had paid sums amounting to about $10,000.00 towards the Husband’s debts in 2016[^15], these payments were voluntary on her part at the time before the breakdown of the marriage. Further, the Husband had moved out of the matrimonial home and moved in with his parents by July 2018. The Wife continued to retain the rental proceeds from the studio room in the matrimonial flat (currently amounting to $1,500.00).

### Lump sum maintenance

24     The Wife claimed a lump sum maintenance of $60,000.00 (being $500.00/month x 10 years). Her take home monthly salary is around $2,000.00 and she is currently received rental income of $1,500.00 from renting out a studio room in the matrimonial flat. This would be more than sufficient to cover her claimed monthly expenses of $1,300.00. However, she argued that she would have to contribute at least $500.00 towards the two children’s expenses, repay her debts and the mortgage of the matrimonial home.

25     The Husband argued that there should be no maintenance for the Wife. Whilst he used to earn a net monthly income of around $5,000.00, he has been unemployed since April 2019. His company forced him to resign after Corrupt Practices Investigations Bureau (CPIB) investigations. The Wife remained gainfully employed throughout the marriage and earned sufficient monies for her upkeep.

26     I bore in mind that the Husband has always been a much higher income earner and previously maintained the Wife by giving her a monthly sum. He further allowed her to retain his share of the rental income from the matrimonial home but this source of income would cease for the Wife if she is unable to take-over the matrimonial home. Moving forward, she would also have to bear the cost of her accommodation for herself and the two children, and her claimed expense has not factored in such cost. In these circumstances, I found it fair to award the Wife a lump sum maintenance of $10,000.00 ($500.00 x 20 months). With the lump sum maintenance, the Wife would be entitled to 67% of the matrimonial home.
