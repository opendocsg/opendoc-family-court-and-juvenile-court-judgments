Family law – Ancillary matters – Amendment – Variation

31 May 2019

### District Judge Darryl Soh:

## Introduction

1       This matter concerns an application to amend and vary orders (“the Application”) made on 7 June 2017 and 17 July 2017 in respect of ancillary reliefs arising from divorce proceedings between the Plaintiff/Ex-Husband (“the Ex-Husband”) and the Defendant/Ex-Wife (“the Ex-Wife”) (collectively referred to as “the Parties”). The Application was filed by the Ex-Husband _vide_ FC/SUM 3306/2018, which I allowed in part. The Ex-Husband has appealed against the whole of my decision. In these grounds, I explain my decision in greater detail.

## Background Facts and Summary of Divorce Proceedings

2       The Parties have been divorced for almost two years and they have a nine-year-old son (“the Child”) residing in India. The Parties reside in Singapore. Interim Judgment and Final Judgment were granted on 13 July 2016 and 3 November 2017 respectively, with orders on ancillary reliefs made on 7 June 2017 and 17 July 2017 (“the AM Orders”). The background leading to the Parties’ divorce, the list of AM Orders made, and the written grounds of the AM Orders are set out in <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGFC 120</span> (“the AM GD”).

3       For the purposes of my decision herein, I summarise the AM Orders that are relevant and material to the Application. I granted the Ex-Wife sole custody, care and control of the Child and for the Ex-Husband to contribute $700.00 monthly as child’s maintenance. In respect of the matrimonial pool of assets, I ordered the pool to be divided in the ratio of 60:40 in favour of the Ex-Husband. To effect a distribution of the pool as close enough to the said ratio, I ordered the Matrimonial Flat to be sold within six months and for the sale proceeds to be divided between the Ex-Husband and the Ex-Wife in the ratio of 44:56 respectively after deducting the outstanding mortgage loan and related expenses of the sale. The Ex-Husband was ordered to return all jewellery belonging to the Ex-Wife and the Parties were to retain the remaining assets in their own names without division. Finally, I ordered the Ex-Husband to pay monthly maintenance of $500.00 to the Ex-Wife for a period of five years.

4       The Ex-Husband subsequently filed a Notice of Appeal _vide_ HCF/DCA xx/2017 (“the First Appeal”) on 19 June 2017 against my orders in respect of the Child (save for the Ex-Husband’s access), the return of the Ex-Wife’s jewellery, and the maintenance for the Ex-Wife. He did not proceed with the First Appeal and it was deemed to be withdrawn on 20 November 2017 – a Notice of Deemed Withdrawal of Appeal was sent to the Ex-Husband’s former solicitors. That deemed withdrawal was particularly material in light of the arguments advanced by the Ex-Husband in support of his Application.

## Prayers Sought in FC/SUM 3306/2018

5       About a year after the deemed withdrawal, the Ex-Husband filed the Application on 17 September 2018. He essentially made the following prayers:

> (a)     The order for the sale of the Matrimonial Flat to be amended to expressly provide for the outstanding Hong Leong Finance housing loan to be deducted from the net proceeds of sale.

> (b)     An extension of time to sell the Matrimonial Flat within three months from the date of the order, for the Ex-Wife to deliver vacant possession of the Matrimonial Flat within one month from the date of the order, and for the Ex-Husband to have sole conduct of the sale of the Matrimonial Flat.

> (c)     The amounts paid by the Ex-Husband toward the housing loan, electricity bills, and service and conservancy charges from May 2018 to the date of the sale of the Matrimonial Flat to be deducted from the Ex-Wife’s share of the net sale proceeds of the Matrimonial Flat.

> (d)     Additional standard clauses to deal with the CPF refunds following the sale of the Matrimonial Flat.

> (e)     Reduction of the Ex-Wife’s monthly maintenance payable by the Ex-Husband from $500.00 to $300.00.

> (f)     Reduction of the Child’s monthly maintenance payable by the Ex-Husband from $700.00 to $300.00.

## Decision in FC/SUM 3306/2018

6       I set out below the Parties’ arguments and my decisions on the prayers sought. The Ex-Husband has appealed against the whole of my decision _vide_ HCF/DCA 22/2019.

### (a)   The order for the sale of the Matrimonial Flat to be amended to expressly provide for the outstanding Hong Leong Finance housing loan to be deducted from the net proceeds of sale.

7       The Ex-Husband prayed for the order pertaining to the sale of the Matrimonial Flat be amended to expressly provide for the outstanding mortgage to be deducted from the sale proceeds of the Matrimonial Flat. He argued that the extracted order made no express provision in this regard. The Ex-Wife submitted that an amendment was not necessary because the deduction was implied.

8       For ease of reference, I reproduce paragraph 3a of the Order of Court FC/ORC xxxx/2017 that was extracted by the Parties:

> The \[Matrimonial Flat\] to be sold in open market within 6 months of the Final Judgement. The net proceeds of the sale of the flat, **less the expenses incurred for the sale**, shall be divided in the ratio of 44% to the \[Ex-Husband\] and 56% to the \[Ex-Wife\].

> \[Emphasis in bold added\]

9       I agreed with the Ex-Husband that the extracted order was ambiguous vis-à-vis the deduction of the mortgage. The Parties need only to refer to paragraph 12(e) of the AM GD where I expressly articulated that the deduction was to be made from the sale proceeds prior to division. This was perhaps unintentionally omitted from the extracted order. I consequently allowed, for clarity, the order for sale to be amended to include the discharge of the mortgage.

### (b)   An extension of time to sell the Matrimonial Flat within three months from the date of the order, for the Ex-Wife to deliver vacant possession of the Matrimonial Flat within one month from the date of the order, and for the Ex-Husband to have sole conduct of the sale of the Matrimonial Flat.

10     The Ex-Husband averred that the Matrimonial Flat has yet to be sold and that the Parties continue to reside there. At the point of the divorce, the Minimum Occupation Period (“MOP”) of the Matrimonial Flat had not lapsed and that the Parties were in the process of appealing to the Housing and Development Board (“HDB”) for dispensation to sell the Matrimonial Flat.

11     The Ex-Husband submitted that the Ex-Wife was uncooperative with the sale. Consequently, he asked for the court to order the Ex-Wife to deliver vacant possession within one month and for him to have sole conduct of the sale. The Ex-Wife denied that she was uncooperative. She alleged that the property agent appointed by the Ex-Husband demanded a high commission that was in breach of the relevant regulations. She claimed that she herself appointed a property agent to facilitate the sale of the Matrimonial Flat.

12     During the hearing before me, counsel for the Ex-Wife confirmed that her client shared the intention to sell the Matrimonial Flat and I was cognisant that the AM Orders did not prescribe which of the Parties is to have conduct of the sale. I considered the Parties’ respective affidavits and the division ratio of the sale proceeds and I was satisfied that the Parties held a common interest in obtaining the best possible price from the sale of the Matrimonial Flat. Materially, I was not convinced that the Ex-Wife was obstructing the sale _per se_. In my view, she had reasonable disagreements on how it is to be sold.

13     In view of the material change in circumstances, in so far that the Matrimonial Flat has yet to be sold, I ordered that the Parties be granted joint conduct of the sale. Further, as the Parties needed time to apply to the HDB to obtain the necessary dispensation to sell the Matrimonial Flat, I granted a six-month extension of time commencing 26 February 2019 for the sale to take place. Finally, I directed the Parties to file a variation application should a party thereafter fail to cooperate in the sale and I will make the necessary orders. In light of my orders and directions above, I made no orders in respect of the Ex-Husband’s prayers for the Ex-Wife to deliver vacant possession of the Matrimonial Flat and for him to be granted sole conduct of the sale of the Matrimonial Flat.

### (c)   The amounts paid by the Ex-Husband toward the housing loan, electricity bills, and service and conservancy charges from May 2018 to the date of the sale of the Matrimonial Flat to be deducted from the Ex-Wife’s share of the net sale proceeds of the Matrimonial Flat.

14     The Ex-Husband sought to vary the AM Orders so as to deduct from the Ex-Wife’s share of the net sale proceeds the amounts he paid for the housing loan, electricity bills, and service and conservancy charges (collectively referred to as “the Outgoings”) from May 2018. The sole basis for his prayer was that the Ex-Wife had been uncooperative in the sale of the Matrimonial Flat. The Ex-Wife rejected his allegations and argued that there was no basis for the Ex-Husband’s prayer.

15     I agreed with the Ex-Wife since, as held in \[12\] above, I was not convinced that the Ex-Wife was obstructing the sale _per se_. Be that as it may, I was of the view that it was just and equitable for the Ex-Wife to contribute towards her share of the Outgoings incurred for the Matrimonial Flat between the date of my AM Orders and its eventual sale. The Outgoings ought to be shared between the Parties in the ratio of 60:40 in favour of the Ex-Husband as this ensured that the final division ratio of the matrimonial pool of assets remains consistent. I consequently directed the Parties to work out amongst themselves on how the Ex-Wife’s share of the Outgoings is to be set off from her share of the net sale proceeds. I granted Parties liberty to apply should they fail to agree on effecting my view on the Outgoings. In the meantime, I made no order on the Ex-Husband’s prayer.

### (d)   Additional standard clauses to deal with the CPF refunds following the sale of the Matrimonial Flat.

16     The Ex-Husband sought to amend the AM Orders to insert standard clauses to deal with the CPF refunds following the sale of the Matrimonial Flat. The Ex-Wife submitted that the Ex-Husband did not provide any reason in his affidavits or submissions as to why the AM Orders ought to be amended. I agreed with the Ex-Wife and I was of the further view that the AM Orders already expressly provided in paragraph 3b(i) of the Order of Court FC/ORC xxxx/2017 that the CPF refunds were to be made in accordance with prevailing CPF Laws and Regulations. Accordingly, I made no order on the Ex-Husband’s prayer.

### (e)   Reduction of the Ex-Wife’s monthly maintenance payable by the Ex-Husband from $500.00 to $300.00.

17     Pursuant to the AM Orders, the Ex-Husband is to pay $500.00 in monthly maintenance to the Ex-Wife for a period of five years. In his Application, the Ex-Husband prayed for a downward variation of the monthly maintenance from $500.00 to $300.00. He advanced two submissions in support.

18     First, the Ex-Husband submitted that there had been material changes in circumstances. He submitted that the Child has yet to return to Singapore, which he argued ran counter to the expectation that the Ex-Wife needed to focus on the Child’s development as set out in paragraph 46 of the AM GD. In addition, the Ex-Husband averred that the Ex-Wife is self-sufficient and therefore only required a lower maintenance sum.[^1] He further argued that the Ex-Wife failed to make full and frank disclosure when she did not provide any document to support her claim during the Application that her monthly income had decreased to $1,310.00. Finally, he argued that he was diagnosed with pre-diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure, and will consequently earn less in the foreseeable future.[^2]

19     Second, he disputed the Ex-Wife’s monthly expenses stated in the AM GD by arguing that those expenses were inflated.

20     In reply, the Ex-Wife submitted that the Ex-Husband had not adduced any evidence to show any misrepresentation or mistake of fact or that there had been material changes in circumstances. She characterised the Ex-Husband’s Application as a backdoor appeal against the maintenance order.[^3]

21     I agreed with the Ex-Wife’s submissions in totality as it was clear that the Ex-Husband was using the Application as a backdoor appeal. He had the opportunity to challenge my findings during the First Appeal against the alleged inflated expenses and self-sufficiency of the Ex-Wife but he chose not to proceed. He cannot renew his dissatisfaction against my orders by way of a variation.

22     I also did not accept the Ex-Husband’s submission that the Child remaining in India amounted to a material change in circumstances since the Ex-Wife continues to hold the intention to have the Child return to Singapore and when that happens, her income-generating capacity will be affected.[^4] I was similarly unconvinced by his arguments on his deteriorating health and the Ex-Wife’s alleged failure to make full and frank disclosure as they were feeble attempts to establish material changes in circumstances. These grounds were sufficient for me to dismiss his application for a downward variation.

23     For completeness, I will add that I was cognisant that the maintenance order was to ensure that the Ex-Wife received a fair share of the wealth acquired during the marriage and that it provided for the periodic payments to the Ex-Wife for a period of five years so that she gains the necessary self-sufficiency. Varying the maintenance order will have a direct impact on the share of wealth that I ordered at the conclusion of the divorce proceedings. I highlighted these concerns to the Ex-Husband’s counsel. However, as the Ex-Husband’s case for variation lacked any merit to begin with, I saw no reason to go beyond merely articulating my concerns.

### (f)   Reduction of the Child’s monthly maintenance payable by the Ex-Husband from $700.00 to $300.00.

24     Pursuant to the AM Orders, the Ex-Husband is to contribute $700.00 in monthly maintenance for the Child. This amount comprised $200.00 for the Child’s share of the household expenses and $500.00 for the Child’s education and medical expenses in India.[^5] In his Application, the Ex-Husband advanced two broad submissions in support of a downward variation from $700.00 to $300.00.

25     First, adopting the same approach as he did for a downward variation of the monthly maintenance for the Ex-Wife, the Ex-Husband submitted that the Ex-Wife had inflated the expenses for the Child during the divorce proceedings.[^6] In reply, the Ex-Wife adopted the same arguments in \[20\] above to rebut the Ex-Husband’s case, which I agreed with and dismissed the Ex-Husband’s case on the same grounds set out in \[21\] above.

26     Second, he argued that there was a material change in circumstances in so far as some of the Child’s education-related expenses have decreased. Instead of returning to Singapore, the Child continued to remain in India and had incurred lower expenses for his education and extra-curricular activities (_i.e._ school fees and tuition, swimming and drawing classes)[^7] vis-à-vis the breakdown in expenses claimed by the Ex-Wife as set out in paragraph 39 of the AM GD.

27     In reply, the Ex-Wife submitted that the Ex-Husband had been selective in his reference to receipts and that the overall expenses for the Child remained the same. In particular, tuition expenses have risen since the original maintenance order (_i.e._ Rs 300 to Rs 2000) and drawing class are new expenses being incurred.

28     I was unconvinced that there had been a material change in circumstances. My starting premise was that the component in dispute was the $500.00 earmarked for the Child’s education and medical expenses since the Ex-Husband’s case in his Application was focused on the education-related expenses. While I accepted that the school fees contemplated in the original maintenance order was higher (_i.e._ Rs 15,000.00 when compared to Rs 3,983.20), there are other components that make up educational expenses. For instance, transport to and from his school, books, and uniforms are just some examples that were considered in the original maintenance order. It has been almost two years since that order was made on 7 June 2017 and inflation is an additional component to be accounted for. Conceptually, I did not find the Ex-Husband’s approach of isolating individual changes in expenditure _submitted_ at the time of the AM Orders particularly useful since the amount of maintenance ordered then was based on my assessment of what constituted _reasonable_ expenses, _i.e._ $500.00 being the Ex-Husband’s share of the Child’s education and medical expenses.[^8] To that end, the amount ordered against the Ex-Husband for those expenses _continued to be reasonable in the whole_ and I was unconvinced that a downward variation was warranted. Accordingly, I dismissed the Ex-Husband’s prayer.

## Conclusion

29     At the conclusion of the proceedings, both sets of counsel submitted for the court to make no order as to costs. I agreed with counsel and made that order as submitted.
