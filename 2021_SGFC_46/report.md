Family Law – Maintenance – Variation of child maintenance order

30 April 2021

### District Judge Azmin Jailani:

1       Summons No. 2953 of 2020 (“SUM 2953”) was the plaintiff-father’s application for a downward variation of child maintenance. The maintenance order was made as part of the overall orders for the ancillary matters.

2       Briefly, the maintenance order required the defendant to pay, among other things, a fixed monthly sum of $1,500, the children’s tuition fees, and the children’s insurance premiums. In SUM 2953, the plaintiff sought for a reduction of the fixed sum to $500, and that he only be required to pay for the children’s insurance premiums. The defendant further asked that any variation be backdated to April 2020.

3       The plaintiff’s counsel and the defendant appeared before me on 27 November 2020 to present their arguments. After reviewing the materials before me and after hearing parties, I granted the plaintiff’s application insofar as the fixed monthly sum was reduced to $1,000, and that he only pay for the children’s insurance premiums. That said, I was only minded for the variation to be effective for a period of 8 months (i.e., October 2020 to June 2021). Thereafter, the plaintiff’s maintenance obligations would revert to its original terms. At that hearing, I provided brief reasons for my decision.

4       Dissatisfied, the plaintiff has appealed against my decision. Against that backdrop, I now provide the full grounds of my decision.

## Background to the dispute

### Parties

5       Parties were married in 2001. There are two children to the marriage. The elder child (“Child 1”), a girl, was born in 2003. The younger child (“Child 2”), a boy, was born in 2008. At the time of the present application, Child 1 and Child 2 were 17 years old and 12 years old respectively.

6       The plaintiff commenced divorce proceedings in September 2016. The defendant filed her defence and counterclaim in October 2016. Interim judgment was granted on 9 March 2017 on both the plaintiff’s claim and the defendant’s counterclaim. The interim judgment also included various consent orders relating to the custody, care and control and access of the children. All other ancillary matters were adjourned.

### ORC 178/2018 and the maintenance order

7       The remaining ancillary matters were contested, and orders were made on 13 March 2018 (i.e., ORC 178/2018, or “ORC 178”). For the purposes of this judgment, paragraph 1 of ORC 178 provides that:

>     The Plaintiff shall pay to the Defendant's designated bank account the sum of $1,500.00 per month as child maintenance. Further, the Plaintiff shall provide the Defendant with a maid and a car of up to 1.6 litres (of Japanese make) till the children finish A-levels or till they stop school, whichever is earlier. The Plaintiff shall also pay for the children's tuition and insurance premiums.

>     (the “Maintenance Order”)

8       As seen from the above, the Maintenance Order has the following components:

> (a)     A fixed monthly sum of $1,500;

> (b)     the provision of a car and a domestic helper “till the children finish A-levels or till they stop school, whichever is earlier”;

> (c)     payment of the children’s tuition; and

> (d)     payment of the children’s insurance premiums.

9       On the defendant’s evidence, the aggregate expenditure of the foregoing would be as follows:[^1]

10     I note that the plaintiff appealed against the ancillary orders (see the court’s judgment in _ULD v ULE_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGFC 36</span>, or “GD”). After the GD was released, the plaintiff’s appeal was deemed withdrawn due to non-compliance of the relevant appeal timelines.

### Plaintiff’s non-compliance with the Maintenance Order and subsequent enforcement proceedings

11     On his own evidence, the plaintiff states that he has been complying with the Maintenance Order up till February 2020. However, from March 2020 onwards, he had not been paying the full sums provided for in the order. As elaborated below, this is due to a reduction in his income sometime in April 2020.

12     The plaintiff candidly listed the extent of his shortfall from March 2020 to August 2020.[^2] As at August 2020, the plaintiff had chalked up an arrears of $14,054.

13     On the defendant’s end, she was amenable to giving the plaintiff some time to make up for the shortfall. However, after several reminders, the plaintiff still did not make good the payment of the arrears. As such, based on the court’s records, on 6 July 2020, the defendant commenced enforcement proceedings (_vide_ MSS 17XX of 2020, or “MSS 17XX”).

14     On 1 October 2020, the plaintiff commenced SUM 2953.

15     On 27 October 2020, the plaintiff entered into a _consent order_ for MSS 17XX (EMO 10XX/2020, or “EMO 10XX”). As of the date of that order, the agreed arrears had amounted to $17,954. The plaintiff agreed to repay the arrears in instalments of $200 from December 2020 to May 2021, and thereafter in instalments of $500 from June 2021. Parties also agreed that the sums due under the Maintenance Order remain payable.

16     Interestingly, EMO 10XX provided also that “\[t\]he agreed arrears amount stands pending and subject to current variation proceedings \[i.e., SUM 2953\]”. Put another way, parties appear to have acknowledged the amount of $17,954, but that it _might_ change depending on the outcome of SUM 2953. If the outcome of SUM 2953 was not in his favour, the plaintiff would be taken to accept the arrears amount as it stood in EMO 10XX.

## Parties’ arguments

18     I now summarise parties’ arguments.

19     As highlighted at \[8\] above, the Maintenance Order comprises of 4 components. In SUM 2953, the plaintiff sought a variation of the Maintenance Order such that he is only be required to pay:

> (a)     The fixed monthly sum of $500; and

> (b)     payment of the children’s insurance premiums only.

20     The upshot of this is that plaintiff wishes to be released of his obligation to pay for the car, domestic helper, and tuition. As regards the fixed monthly sum, he is asking for his obligation to be reduced from $1,500 to $500.

21     In support of his application, the plaintiff made the following points:

> (a)     The plaintiff is a director and minority shareholder of a car leasing company. Before April 2020, he was earning a gross salary of $8,000, and a nett salary of $6,979.[^3]

> (b)     However, in April 2020, in connection with the ‘Circuit Breaker’ measures instituted by the Singapore government due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company’s revenue “shrank drastically”[^4]. Because of the drop in revenue, the company decided to reduce salaries and cut costs. On the plaintiff’s evidence, his nett salary was cut in half to a nett amount of $3,198.50.[^5] At the hearing, I had asked the plaintiff’s counsel, Mr Gan, for any contemporaneous documents by the company on the reasons and extent of the salary cuts, and how it was applied in the company. Mr Gan was only able to state that there were no other contemporaneous documents other than the plaintiff’s pay slips, and whatever the plaintiff stated in his affidavit.

> (c)     On his evidence, the plaintiff listed his expenses to amount to $4,761.[^6] I pause here and note that the plaintiff’s calculation was not easily digestible as it only factored in _portions_ of the Maintenance Order which was paying (as opposed to the proper exposure as listed at \[9\] above). It also intermingled payments of the children’s expenses _outside_ of what the plaintiff contemplated to fall under the Maintenance Order. It also did not take into account other expenses I deal with below.

> (d)     Be that as it may, taking the plaintiff’s value for the time being, his position is that because of the drop in his salary, his expenses now exceeded his income by $1,562.50 (i.e., $4,761 - $1,398.50).

> (e)     In addition to those expenses I highlighted above, the plaintiff highlighted how he had two fairly significant loans to service. The first loan was from his sister amounting to $75,000 to assist him in paying off his credit card debts.[^7] I note that it is unclear from the plaintiff’s documents how and when these credit card debts were accumulated. In his evidence, he mentioned the debts were with Standard Chartered Bank.[^8]

> (f)     The second loan was for $80,000 from a gas company for the supply of gas to a noodle and claypot rice restaurant the plaintiff opened with his business partner sometime in September 2019.[^9] Because of COVID-19, the business closed down. As the plaintiff and the partner were personal guarantors to the loan, they had to continue the monthly repayments of $3,500. Whilst the agreement was for both the plaintiff and his partner to bear the monthly repayments equally (i.e., $1,750 each), the plaintiff only contributed $500 in light of his current financial situation.

> (g)     The plaintiff lastly highlighted how he has no significant assets or savings to pay the defendant,[^10] and how he could be made a bankrupt if he had to pay the full terms of the Maintenance Order.[^11] By granting his prayers, the plaintiff would be relived of approximately $3,000 of his obligations under the Maintenance Order.[^12]

> (h)     In terms of backdating, the plaintiff asked that any variation take effect from April 2020, the time his salary decreased. Without backdating, the plaintiff contended that he would still be subject to “numerous expenses” such as the arrears payment under the EMO 10XX, and that the “risk of \[him\] being bankrupt … will therefore remain prevalent – as will the risk that \[his\] children may get nothing from \[him\] as a result.[^13] Put another way, the plaintiff was effectively signalling to this court that not granting him the prayers sought in SUM 2953 would amount to depriving the children of receiving _any_ maintenance subsequently.

22     In response, the defendant makes the following points:

> (a)     At the outset, the defendant sought to clarify the actual overlay under the Maintenance Order.[^14] The defendant clarified that from November 2020, there would no longer be a need to spend $890 for tuition after Child 2 completes PSLE.

> (b)     As highlighted above, the defendant empathised with the defendant during the COVID-19 period, and was prepared to give him some time to catch up on his payment at a later date. Sometime in July 2020, the defendant tried to enquire with the plaintiff on whether he was able to resume the original payments, or increase his contribution from $500. However, the defendant did not receive a reassuring reply.[^15] Feeling that had reached an impasse with the plaintiff, she commenced MSS 17XX.

> (c)     The defendant further queried why the plaintiff was not complying with the Maintenance Order, but at the same time was able to take the children to overseas trips to Japan and Korea,[^16] and purchase expensive items such as new “Apple mobile phone, Apple Air Pod Pro and Pencil and frequent Japanese restaurants”[^17]. The defendant also questioned why the plaintiff could not afford the Maintenance Order, but could afford to spend legal fees to reduce the Maintenance Order. As regards the expenditure for the children, the plaintiff does not deny spending on these items for the children, but clarified that some of these expenses were incurred before his reduction in income to placate the children, and was funded by selling some personal items.[^18] Some of these items sold included luxury items, and ‘limited edition’ liquor ranging from $1,000 to $3,000[^19] I pause here and note that the total sale of such liquor amounted to approximately $8,640, which, on the plaintiff’s calculation, amounted to more than 2 months’ worth of payments under the Maintenance Order.

> (d)     The defendant also highlighted how the plaintiff has numerous assets in terms of condominiums in Malaysia.[^20] The plaintiff confirms that he has 4 condominiums in Johor Bahru.[^21] However, he stated that he has not had much luck selling the properties, and the rental he was collecting did not cover the mortgage instalments.[^22] I pause here and note that whilst making this point, the plaintiff _does not_ these mortgage payments as part of his expenses.

> (e)     The defendant next highlighted that the plaintiff’s nett financial impact due to COVID-19 may not be a significant as what the plaintiff contends. The defendant suggested that the plaintiff’s company would have received some government aid, and that he would also have received certain support packages, part of which could be used to assist in the children’s expenses.[^23] The plaintiff disputes this.[^24] The defendant was also suspicious as to the veracity of the loan extended to the plaintiff by his sister.[^25]

> (f)     The defendant also highlighted that a monthly contribution of $500 was simply inadequate to assist with the children’s expenses.[^26] As the defendant puts it, “$500 \[was\] definitely way too little to maintain 2 teenagers.” The defendant also sought to justify the necessity of the car to transport the children.[^27] Whilst the defendant attempted to take on part-time work on an ad-hoc basis,[^28] this was challenging given the concurrent need to care and discipline the children.[^29] In response, whilst the plaintiff recognised that the children have ‘wants’, it was something that he could no longer afford due to his reduced income, and it was “important for the entire family to limit \[its\] expenditure to what is necessary”[^30].

## Analysis and findings

23     Against the foregoing backdrop, I now provide my analysis and findings.

24     I first touch on the law. There law regarding variation of maintenance orders is not controversial. Any variation application necessitates an examination of key circumstances before and after the relevant order to determine whether the court’s intervention is required. Whether or not such post-order circumstances is of sufficient materiality or good cause will turn on the facts of each case.

25     In the present case, it was also necessary to overlay these principles with the fact that the Maintenance Order is principally for the benefit of the _children_. This requires a balancing exercise in ensuring that the children’s welfare is not significantly affected by any variation, but at the same time recognising the payor’s ability to satisfy the maintenance order. To my mind, this may also involve moderating any variation made to ensure that the children’s welfare is, where possible, able to return to its prior state.

### Should the Maintenance Order be varied at all?

26     At the heart of the plaintiff’s application is the reduction of his salary due to the initial effects of COVID-19. If not for COVID-19, there would be no reduction in the plaintiff’s income, and consequently no necessity for SUM 2953.

27     As highlighted above, the defendant herself does not appear to dispute, _prima facie_, that there has in fact been a reduction in the plaintiff’s income due to COVID-19. It is for this reason why the defendant herself confirms that she was prepared for the plaintiff to pay less than what the Maintenance Order provided, but for the plaintiff to make up for the shortfall subsequently. Where parties truly diverged was _when_ that recovery would take place. This resulted in the strained interaction between parties, especially when the defendant sought clarification on when normal payment would resume (resulting in the plaintiff providing, to the defendant’s mind, unsatisfactory answers). To the defendant’s mind, the plaintiff’s responses were more of resignation than offering a real solution on how the shortfall has been affecting the children.

28     This impasse then escalated into MSS 17XX, and thereafter SUM 2953.

29     After assessing the evidence before me, and whilst I was slightly apprehensive of the plaintiff’s financial standing (based on plaintiff’s own acknowledgement of his assets, and how much he was able to liquidate), I was of a view that some adjustment of his obligations under the Maintenance Order was justified. I was prepared to accept that it was, at least for the present time, no longer sustainable for the plaintiff to pay the _full terms_ of the Maintenance Order. To allow the full terms of the Maintenance Order to for the present time would, in my view, be futile. A court does not make (or in this case, retain) an order in vain.

30     To my mind, the real issue was the _extent_ in which the Maintenance Order ought to be varied.

31     At the hearing, I asked Mr Gan that since SUM 2953 was predicated principally on the effects of COVID-19, whether a variation, if warranted, was more temporary than permanent. This especially in the context of who the recipients of the Maintenance Order were. Mr Gan’s candid submission was that should the situation improve, the presumption was that the plaintiff’s contributions could revert back to its original state.

32     After considering the matter, I was inclined to accept that the circumstances warranted a temporary adjustment of the plaintiff’s obligations under the Maintenance Order.

### To what extent should the Maintenance Order be varied?

33     I deal with the extent of the variation.

34     It is worth reiterating at this juncture that the Maintenance Order is principally for the benefit of the children. Putting aside the issue of how much the defendant should also assist in the financial needs of the children (despite carrying the separate burden of being the care and control parent), the fact remains that a reduction of the Maintenance Order _will inevitably affect the children_. While the plaintiff may believe that a variation saves him from bankruptcy (and highlights this as a contention to say that any unfavourable order will mean that the children may receive no maintenance), the ultimate ‘losers’ are the children.

#### Quantum of variation

35     I now turn to with the quantum of the variation.

36     In determining the quantum of adjustment, I firstly deal with the expenses of the children. On the defendant’s evidence, she lists the household expenses as follows:[^31]

37     For the purposes of these proceedings, I have pro-rated certain items to reflect the proportionate costs allocated to the children, as that would provide a better picture of the children’s expenses. In terms of these expenses listed by the defendant, I note that the plaintiff did not substantively dispute those figures, making no mention of the same in his reply affidavit[^33].

38     Nevertheless, I pause here and not that in listing the above expenses, the defendant did not make mention of the costs relating to the children’s insurance premiums or the upkeep costs of the car, both of which were also provided for in the Maintenance Order. Taking those figures into account (see \[9\] above), the children’s aggregate expenses would be as follows:

> _Aggregate expenses:_

>> \=$3,037

>> +$403 _(car insurance + road tax + petrol)_

>> \+ $370 _(children’s insurance premiums)_

>> \= **$3,810** (**_or_****$2,920****_after deducting tuition)_**

39     From the above calculation, it can be seen that the children’s aggregate expenses ($3,810) _essentially mirrors_ what the Maintenance Order provides ($3,892). This means that that whatever the defendant is providing is _just enough_ to cover for the children’s expenses. Even then, it is worth noting that the aggregate figure of $3,810 is _after_ I made certain adjustments of the defendant’s figures (see \[36\] above). The upshot of this is that what is being provided for under the Maintenance Order is _lower_ than the total expenses listed.

40     Against that backdrop, on the defendant’s evidence, if I were to grant him the prayers sought in SUM 2953, his obligation would drop from $3,892 to $870.[^34] That is approximately a 78% reduction in his maintenance obligations.

41     After considering parties’ evidence and submissions, I was not inclined to accept that this was a justifiable reduction in the plaintiff’s obligation, more so as a permanent reduction. This figure was, in my view, was manifestly insufficient to cover a sufficient amount of the children’s expenses. At this juncture, I note separately from the GD (see \[18\] to \[20\]) that it was envisaged that the defendant was to return to the workforce and be able to contribute up to 20% of the family expenses[^35]. Even if I were to accept that this was what the defendant was expected to do, this still would not justify the sort of reduction the plaintiff was now asking for in the present application. I was of the view that a contribution of $500 was not reasonable in the circumstances. The reduction sought by the plaintiff may allow him to ride out COVID-19, but where would that leave Child 1 and Child 2? How was the defendant going to make up for the difference? It bears mentioning that even in the plaintiff’s own evidence, he does not state _how_ the defendant was going to make up for this shortfall.

42     In determining the appropriate reductions to make, I turn to each of the components of the Maintenance Order:

> (a)     As regards the children’s insurance premiums, since the plaintiff took the position that he would continue paying these expenses, I saw no reason to depart from it.

> (b)     As regards the tuition for Child 2, I was of the view that this was a variable, and in comparison, a non-critical expense which should now be borne by the defendant. In any case, this point is moot given the defendant’s own evidence that this item of expenses will cease to apply from November 2020. Therefore, the ‘reversion’ of that obligation after the variation period I ordered would be of no consequence to the plaintiff.

> (c)     As regards the car, this was broken into various components – the insurance premiums, road tax, season parking, and petrol. As between these various expense components, I was of the view the petrol was the variable expense which the defendant had control over. As such, I was of the view that that expense ought to be borne by the defendant.

> (d)     As regards the domestic helper, the plaintiff provided no evidence that he should not be made to contribute to this expense (at least insofar as it related to the children’s share of such expense). He also provided no evidence why such expense was extravagant or unnecessary, such that the defendant should be bearing the entirety of this item of expense. I note from the GD that these were expenses which the plaintiff has always been paying for even before the breakdown of the marriage.

> (e)     As regards the fix maintenance sum, I was of the view that a one-third reduction (i.e., 33%) of the fix monthly sum from $1,500 to $1,000 was a reasonable and not insurmountable sum for the plaintiff. Put another way, this was a moderate increase of $500 more than what he prayed for. In any case, this sum would have been more than accounted for, with spare, as a result of the cessation of Child 2’s tuition fees.

43     Following from the above, the nett effect of the varied Maintenance Order would be as follows:

44     As can be seen from above, the eventual reduction amounts to a 56% reduction of his maintenance obligations. After assessing the evidence, I was not inclined to accept that this reduced sum (a similar reduction to his reduction in salary) was something which was insurmountable for the plaintiff. I pause here and note that a review of the defendant’s bank statements[^36] indicate, among other things, a not insignificant amount of spending on his UOB credit cards[^37] (_not_ the Standard Chartered credit card which was the subject matter of the loan from his sister), as well as a fund transfer exceeding $3,000 in June 2020[^38]. Whilst I was not inclined to draw any adverse inferences, I was not wholly convinced that this was a sum which the plaintiff could not afford.

#### Duration of variation

45     I now turn to the duration of the variation. As I mentioned earlier, I was inclined to grant a temporary variation over a permanent reduction in the plaintiff’s obligations.

46     In terms of the duration of the variation, I first acknowledge there is no precise science as to what would constitute an appropriate length of time. This is especially so given the dynamic developments of COVID-19. The court is only able to make do with the information available at that point in time. Information which is presented to the court through parties’ evidence, as well general information which this court can have judicial notice of.

47     In the present case, I first note that by the time SUM 2953 came for hearing (in late-November 2020), Singapore was well into ‘Phase 2’ of the relaxation measures. There would, perhaps not to the fullest extent, some discernible recovery in the plaintiff’s business as businesses were slowly opening up. Given the state of things at the relevant time, I considered it appropriate to ensure a sufficient runway to allow the plaintiff time to reorganise the business. In my judgment, I was of the view that an 8-month period was suitable. The 8-month period would mean that the varied Maintenance Order would apply from October 2020 (the time when the plaintiff commence SUM 2953) to June 2021. Absent any indication to the contrary, I was prepared to accept that this length of time was sufficient against backdrop of incremental improvement of the COVID-19 at that point in time. Indeed (and not due to any clairvoyance), it is worth mentioning that since my decision, Singapore transited to ‘Phase 3’ of its relaxation measured in December 2020. I further note that the 8-month period has not yet expired.

48     In essence, I was of the view that on the information available at that period of time, 8 months was reasonable for the plaintiff would be able to improve his situation, so as to be able to resume his obligations under the Maintenance Order thereafter.[^39]

#### Backdating

49     I now turn to the plaintiff’s prayer to backdate the variation of the Maintenance Order to April 2020, the time when the plaintiff’s company decided to cut salaries.

50     It is trite that the court has a wide discretion to backdate maintenance orders (see _AMW v AMZ_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGHC 83</span> at \[13\]; _VDZ v VEA_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHCF 2</span> at \[70\]). This would ordinarily also extend to backdating any variation of a maintenance order. In the present case, I was not inclined to backdate my orders immediately when the plaintiff suffered a drop in income. There was nothing in the evidence before me which suggested that the plaintiff could not sustain the Maintenance Order at the contemporaneous time as the salary drop. The plaintiff, to a certain extent, unilaterally decided on the reduced amount to pay on account of his salary drop without any further consideration of anything else. Perhaps fortunately for him, the defendant was accommodating.

51     To be clear, this is not intended to be any form of admonishment against the plaintiff. In the present circumstances, I was more inclined to determine that a prospective order was more appropriate. That said, I was prepared for the variation to take into effect at the time the plaintiff _commenced_ the present application (i.e., October 2020).

### Supplementary points

52     A final point I make, though not related to the substantive issues in these proceedings, relates to the plaintiff’s application to expunge a portion of the defendant’s affidavit.

53     The plaintiff sought to expunge a portion of the defendant’s affidavit[^40] which narrated what transpired during mediation for MSS 17XX. After assessing the matter, I agreed with Mr Gan, and accordingly ordered that that portion of the defendant’s affidavit be expunged from the record.

## Conclusion

54     For the above reasons, I made the following orders:

> (a)     From October 2020 to June 2021, paragraph 1 of ORC 178 is varied such that:

>> (i)       the fixed monthly maintenance sum to be paid by the plaintiff is reduced to $1,000;

>> (ii)       the defendant is to bear the petrol costs for the car (with the plaintiff paying for the road tax and insurance); and

>> (iii)       the defendant is to bear the expenses for Child 2’s tuition fees.

> (b)     From July 2021 onwards, paragraph 1 of ORC 178 will revert to its original terms.

55     On the issues of costs, Mr Gan submitted that since his client was partially successful, he ought to be awarded with costs. In this regard, Mr Gan submitted that a cost order of $2,000 (inclusive of disbursements) be ordered. I did not agree with Mr Gan, and ordered that parties were to bear their own costs.

56     Lastly, I thank Mr Gan for his assistance to the Court on this matter.
