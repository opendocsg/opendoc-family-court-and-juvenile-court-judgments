### District Judge Sheik Mustafa:

## Introduction

1       At the hearing on ancillary issues of the divorce between the parties, I ordered that the wife be granted sole care and control of their only child, with access to be given to the husband on certain terms, including to bring the child to Norway for temporary visits a year later. I also ordered that the husband contribute $950 a month for maintenance of the child, but no maintenance to the wife. I also ordered that they were both to retain assets already in their sole names. The wife, who is legally aided, has appealed against all the orders.

## Background facts

2       The couple had married on xx June 2011 in Norway. At all material times the wife was a Singaporean and the husband was Norwegian. They lived in Norway for a few years and moved to Singapore. The relationship broke down and the wife commenced these divorce proceedings on 13 December 2016. The husband counterclaimed against her, and they both alleged the others’ unreasonable behaviour.

3       They have a child, who was 4 years old at the time of the hearing. The wife was 42 and the husband was 52 years old.

4       On 31 May 2017, by consent, they were divorced by an interim judgment in this Court based on both the claim and counterclaim, concluding the almost 6-year marriage.

5       The ancillary issues remained. Numerous affidavits were filed, some on the ancillary issues, some on the issue of discovery, and some on interim custody. An interim order of joint custody was consented to by the parties, giving care and control to the wife, and setting specific terms of access for the husband.

6       The ancillary issues were finally fixed to be heard before me on 21 November 2018, but the husband had filed a summons the day before, requesting an order allowing him to bring the child to Norway for Christmas. The wife demurred, and I adjourned the hearing of that summons, with directions for affidavits to be filed in reply, to be heard 3 weeks later together with the hearing of the rest of the ancillary issues.

7       At the next hearing on 11 December 2018, I dismissed the husband’s summons and made the orders that are the subject of the appeal herein.

8       The parties filed numerous affidavits and made numerous accusations against each other of non-disclosure. They were too numerous and detailed to be listed and dealt with individually, but I considered them all carefully, and my narration to follow reflect my findings of facts based on the evidence placed before me.

## Custody Care and Control of the Child

9       The child was a boy who was 4 years old. He was in childcare between 10 am and 5 pm. Both parties argued to be granted sole custody care and control of the child.

10     It was evident that the wife was the primary care giver of the child. The child had never stayed away substantially from his mother. He had met all the developmental milestones of a confident and happy child.

11     The wife contended that the husband had never taken care of the child by himself. She claimed that he did not know how to care for the child even for a few hours, not knowing how to change the child’s diapers. On one occasion the child fell down and broke his leg during the husband’s access time. The child had fallen out of his stroller with the cast on. The wife claimed that the father was “very nonchalant” to the child’s needs, pains and characteristics, nuances and safety.

12     The wife went on to contend that the husband had a “strange temperament”. She claimed that he had been violent towards her for which he resorted to applying for a personal protection order, which she subsequently withdrew. She accused him of having anger management issues as well as a personality disorder.

13     In November 2015, the wife went to India with the child, as she had been before several times. The husband lodged an abduction case against her. He went to India to reconcile with her and thereafter withdrew the complaint.

14     During the course of these proceedings, the parties consented to an interim order for both parents to have joint custody of the child, but for care and control to be with the wife. Access was agreed in that the husband was to have access to the child every Tuesday and Thursday from 6.30 pm to 8.45 pm, and every Saturday from 3 pm to 7 pm; further that the access should take place at a public place of the husband’s choice, and that pick up and drop off points were specified.

15     The wife urged me to change the terms of the access agreed upon in the interim order, saying that there had been a change since the order was given in that the child had started going to school (meaning child care). She also objected “vehemently” to the husband’s request to bring the child to Norway, because the child was a Norwegian citizen and there was a risk that the husband would not bring the child back to Singapore. She alleged that she would not be treated fairly by Norwegian child protection authorities.

16     The husband urged me to grant him sole custody care and control on the basis that the wife had been denying him of his parental rights and made it difficult for him to contact the child. He described her behaviour as “hostile aggressive parenting” that led to “parental alienation syndrome” in the child. He claimed that she used the child as a means to attack him and to vent her frustration at him.

## Applicable principles

17     The principles to apply on this issue are found in section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, which states as follows:

“Where in any proceedings before any Court the custody or upbringing of an infant or the administration of any property belonging to or held in trust for an infant or the application of the income thereof is in question, the Court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration and save in so far as such welfare otherwise requires the father of an infant shall not be deemed to have any right superior to that of the mother in respect of such custody, administration or application nor shall the mother be deemed to have any claim superior than that of the father.”

18     In addition, section 125 of the Women’s Charter states that:

(2)    In deciding in whose custody a child should be placed, the paramount consideration shall be the welfare of the child and subject to this, the Court shall have regard –

(a)    to the wishes of the parents of the child; and

(b)    to the wishes of the child, where he or she is of an age to express an independent opinion.

## Conclusion on custody care and control of the child

19     Taking into account all the facts of the case, the irresistible conclusion was that it was in the best interest of the child that he should remain the joint custody of both parents, and with care and control to remain with the wife. Neither parent was wont to make major decisions that were detrimental to the child, and did not exhibit any attitudes or behaviour that show any major inability to decide in the child’s best interest. With that in mind, there was no reason to disturb their existing parental rights of joint custody. It would not have been in the child’s best interest to order otherwise.

20     Clearly, as the wife had been the primary and continuous caregiver of the child to the present, it would not have been in the child’s best interest to interrupt this. Therefore, I found that it was in the child’s best interest that he should remain in the wife’s sole care and control. The acrimony between his parents made it impossible to contemplate any workable shared care and control arrangement.

21     It was also in the best interest of the child to have regular access to the husband. This was not seriously disputed by the wife. The arrangement that had been ordered in the interim order was best at that moment. It allowed the husband to have regular contact with the child as a father should. I also found that the husband, having been a father of other children, was not totally inexperienced nor incapable of child caring duties. Therefore, I ordered that the access be increased gradually to overnight access in 6 months’ time.

22     The issue in contention was to allow the husband to bring the child to Norway for access. The wife raised her concern that the Norwegian child protection authorities were overzealous and this would disadvantage her due to their intolerance of cultural differences. This objection was purely speculative and therefore not acceptable.

23     It was notable that the husband’s family from his previous marriage was in Norway. The children of his previous marriage have bonded with the child, and it was in the child’s best interest to have continue to have a relationship with his step siblings. Also as a Norwegian, it was also in his best interest to be raised to be exposed to and conscious of that side of his identity. As it stood, there was no evidence that the husband was likely to abduct the child, nor was there any evidence of any attempt to do so thus far. In any event, even if he did, Norway is a Hague Convention jurisdiction, and this was assuring. I therefore ordered the husband to be able to bring the child to Norway for Christmas.

24     However, it was of concern that the husband had never travelled with the child alone, and it was necessary to be cautious of the effect to the child. With this in mind, I did not allow the child to be brought to Norway this year, but I allowed so for the next year. This would allow adequate preparation of the child for the extended time period he was to be away from his primary caregiver, the wife.

25     Further, in view of my order that the husband should have overnight access with the child in 6 months’ time, it would allow the child to be weaned to be with the husband for extended periods without the wife, and this, I hoped would prepare him for the trip to Norway without his mother.

26     In summary, I ordered the child to be in the joint custody of both parties. Care and control was granted solely to the wife. The husband was to have access to child every Tuesday and Thursday 6.30pm to 8.45pm (“weekday access”), and every Saturday 10.00am to 8.45pm (“Weekend access”). From 1 June 2019, the weekday access should remain or adjusted to different days if agreed to by parties, or else should remain the same; and weekend access should be on alternate weekends Saturday 10.00am overnight to Sunday 2.00pm.

27     I also ordered that the husband was permitted to bring the child to Norway for temporary visits not exceeding 15 days every December starting from 2019. The husband should ensure that the child was returned to Singapore to the wife no later than 30 December immediately thereafter. The wife should release the child’s passport to the husband for this purpose. The wife should also furnish the passport details of the child to the husband to enable travel arrangements to be made. The husband should furnish the details of the visit including the travel documents and the addresses where the child should be at to the wife in exchange for the child’s passport.

## Maintenance for the child

28     The wife prayed that the husband should contribute $2,000 per month for the child. The husband submitted that he should contribute $750 instead.

29     The wife claimed that she earned only $1,500 from rent, and $1,000 from freelance catering. The husband alleged that she was in fact earning an income carrying on freelance catering, as well $2,900 from rent of 2 bedrooms. He also asked me to draw an adverse inference against her for failing to declare her income accurately, in particular, concerning her income from AirBnB.

30     The husband claimed to be earning $5,000 a month from a company that he founded. The wife claimed that the husband was earning $20,000 to $25,000 a month instead. She claimed that the husband had been manipulating the accounts of the companies in order to reflect a lower income.

31     The husband adduced tax notices of assessment of his income in the year of assessment 2017. They show his total income to have been $30,600. He had 3 other children in Norway for whom he was liable to maintain. This was not in dispute.

32     The wife claimed that the expenses for the child was approximately $3,595 a month as at the date of her first affidavit of assets and means. I rely on this affidavit as it was the only one that contained a detailed breakdown of the child’s expenses.

33     The breakdown included the following items of note - $500 spent on entertainment monthly, $350 a month as birthday expenses, $200 a month for shoes/bags, $250 a month for dental expenses, and $300 a month for travels. In addition, the wife stated her intention to enrol the child in a preschool at a cost of $1,300 a month. She claimed the child was vegetarian and consumed only organic food.

## Applicable principles

34     Section 69(2) of the Women’s Charter provides that this Court may, on due proof that a parent has neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for his child who is unable to maintain himself, order that parent to pay a monthly allowance or a lump sum for the maintenance of that child.

35     In section 69(4) the Charter provides that this Court, when ordering maintenance for a child under this section, shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the following matters:

a.     the financial needs of the child;

b.     the income, earning capacity (if any), property and other financial resources of the child;

c.     any physical or mental disability of the child;

d.     the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage;

e.     the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family;

f.     the standard of living enjoyed by the child before a parent neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the child;

g.     in the case of a child, the manner in which he was being, and in which the parties to the marriage expected him to be, educated or trained;

h.     the conduct of each of the parties to the marriage, if the conduct is such that it would in the opinion of the Court be inequitable to disregard it.

36     In TIT v TIU[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) the High Court stated that the case of ANJ v ANK accepted the principle that maintenance of children should be apportioned in accordance with, inter alia, the financial capabilities of the parents.

## Conclusion on maintenance of the child

37     The husband produced evidence in support of his declared income. The wife challenged it, and urged for an adverse inference to be drawn. The burden of proving an allegation lies on the person alleging it, and in this instance it was for the wife to prove that the husband was earning more than what he said. She did not. As to whether or not an adverse inference should be drawn against the husband, it is not in every case where a party alleges the other of non-disclosure that an adverse inference should be drawn. There must be some basis or substratum of evidence to raise the inference that there was more than what was produced in evidence before the Court for it to infer anything. This could have been in the form of, for example, spending habits or the possession of assets which gave rise to a reasonable suspicion that the income declared was less than true. In this case, however, the wife had not raised any evidence that showed or could have raised a reasonable belief that the husband was not fully disclosing information to the Court.

38     Based on their declarations and supporting documents, I found that the wife’s monthly income was, on average, $2,500, and the husband’s was, on average, $5,000.

39     I found that the expenses listed by the wife were manifestly excessive. There was no reason a child of 4 years old would need to have $500 spent on entertainment every month, $350 every month as birthday expenses, $200 every month for shoes/bags, $250 every month for dental expenses, and $300 every month for travels. I also found that the wife’s choice of preschool was likely one of the most expensive in Singapore. I instead found that the more reasonable figure of monthly expenses of the child was $1,430.

40     A fair allocation of the cost of the child between the parents based on their relative incomes would be 2:1, and hence the husband should bear $950 and the wife $480.

41     Having concluded as above, I ordered the husband to pay $950 per month towards the maintenance of the child, to be paid by the 1st of every calendar month into the wife’s bank account.

## The Matrimonial Assets

42     The wife claimed a share of the following assets:

43     Only 3 items were jointly owned – the two properties in Oslo and the household furniture. The wife solely owned her CPF accounts and her two bank accounts in Singapore. The husband solely owned all else.

44     The wife submitted that she should be entitled to half of the total asset pool, asking that the husband should be ordered to pay her cash an equivalent to 50% of the total asset value. The husband argued that they both should just retain their own assets.

45     The wife claimed that the properties in Oslo were meant to be their matrimonial home, but had been sold for the equivalent of S$2,114,417 and S$1,805,059. The couple did not own immovable property in Singapore. The wife claimed that she had paid cash in the sum equivalent to S$18,663.20 towards the Oslo home. She also contended that she had made indirect contributions to its acquisition by liaising with the engineers and architects, learning a new language, looking after the husband’s 3 children from his previous marriage, leaving her home country to relocate to Norway with him.

46     The husband contended that there was a net deficit in value of the assets of about $1,944,170, and submitted that the Court order parties to retain assets already in their sole names. He submitted that the two properties in Oslo had been sold away in 2015 and 2017. However, they were sold at a loss, leaving a portion of the mortgage unsettled and owing in the combined sum equivalent to $2,958,117. He bears the payments for the outstanding amount solely. He had several other liabilities, including credit card debt in Norway equivalent to $45,767, and outstanding taxes in Singapore and Norway.

## Applicable principles on division of assets

47     As a start to my inquiry into dealing with the assets, I turned my attention to section 112 (1) of the Women’s Charter. It states that this Court shall have power, when granting or subsequent to the grant of a judgment of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage, to order the division between the parties of any matrimonial asset or the sale of any such asset and the division between the parties of the proceeds of the sale of any such asset in such proportions as the Court thinks just and equitable.

48     The Court of Appeal decision in the case of ANJ V ANK[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) provided for the approach in division of matrimonial assets. Accordingly, the task at hand for me was to derive a ratio which represents the parties’ respective direct contributions towards the acquisition or improvement of matrimonial assets. Next, I was to derive a second ratio which represents the parties’ indirect financial and non-financial contributions towards the welfare of the family. I should then average the two ratios to derive each party’s overall contribution to the family. The “average percentage contribution” or “average ratio” are non-binding figures, and I would have to make adjustments as and when necessary. I bore these in mind, as well as that adjustments might also be necessary whenever the parties’ collective direct contribution do not carry the same weight as that of the parties’ collective indirect contribution.

49     I was aware that the division of matrimonial assets was not an exact science, but neither was it an indefinable art. I noted that it was not mandatory for the Court to exercise its power of division in every single asset of the parties before it as long as it did not detract for the Court’s overall mandate to achieve a just and equitable division in the light of all of the circumstances of the case[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3).

## Conclusion on division of assets

50     The marriage of 6 years was a relatively short one, when seen in view of the age of the parties. It should also be noted that this was the second marriage of the husband.

51     The wife had challenged the husband’s allegation that the properties in Norway were of negative value, yet she was not able to adduce any evidence to show otherwise. She was a co-owner of the properties and should have been able to obtain the information to support her allegation, but she did not.

52     In the absence of compelling contrary evidence from the wife, I found on a balance of probabilities, that the husband’s version of facts was likely to be true, that the couple’s two properties in Norway had been sold, and found them to be of negative value. As the husband did not claim for the wife to share in the deficit, I did not venture to allocate shares of the deficit to both parties.

53     I made the finding that the husband’s total direct contribution to the acquisition of the above assets was $558,269.81 and the wife’s was $106,277. Their combined contribution was $664,546.81.

54     I found that of the parties’ remaining assets besides the properties in Norway, there was a total of $383,375.81 worth. All of them were in sole names, except for household furniture. I found that the relative direct contributions from both parties to the acquisition of all the assets were 16% by the wife and 84% by the husband.

55     I accepted as true that the wife gave up her home and life at her home country to relocate to her husband’s. I also found that she was the primary care giver to their child and she took care of the household. However, I also found that the husband sole undertaking of the losses of the Norway properties in the amount of $2,958,117 was also an indirect contribution that was very substantial in view of the shortness of the marriage. I concluded that their respective indirect contributions to be 50% by the wife and 50% by the husband.

56     I placed equal weight to the direct and the indirect contributions. The result was that the wife was entitled to 33% of the remaining matrimonial asset pool, which had a total value of $383,375.81. Her share would be worth $126,514.

57     I noted that the husband proposed that parties were to retain their own assets. I was satisfied that an order where the wife was to retain all of her CPF monies, all her bank accounts, and the household furniture worth $100,00, would give her a portion of the assets amounting to 35% of the remaining asset pool. I found the difference from 33% to be relatively negligible. In addition, it would have been unnecessarily inconvenient to divide the assets further.

58     In conclusion, I found that accepting the husband’s proposal for each party to retain their own assets was just and reasonable in this case, and ordered so.

## Maintenance for the wife

59     The wife prayed for maintenance of $6,000 per month for herself. The husband did not agree. The husband contended that she had sufficient income to maintain herself.

60     As stated above, I was presented with a wife who was 42 years old, and a husband who was 52 years old. Before her marriage to the husband, the wife had been earning US$4,200 per month. She had ceased to work during the marriage. The husband claimed that, at the present time, the wife was collecting rent of $2,900, as well as income from a catering business.

61     The wife claimed that she earned only $1,500 from rent, and $1,000 from freelance catering. She argued that she had become used to a certain lifestyle during the marriage to the husband. She claimed to have been out of work for 10 years. As she now has a child, she argued that this made it hard for her to secure a good paying job.

## Applicable principles on nominal maintenance of a former wife

62     On the issue of maintenance for a former wife, the Women’s Charter provides –

114.— (1)    In determining the amount of any maintenance to be paid by a man to his wife or former wife, or by a woman to her incapacitated husband or incapacitated former husband, the Court shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the following matters:

(a)    the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;

(b)    the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;

(c)    the standard of living enjoyed by the family before the breakdown of the marriage;

(d)    the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage;

(e)    any physical or mental disability of either of the parties to the marriage;

(f)    the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family; and

(g)    in the case of proceedings for divorce or nullity of marriage, the value to either of the parties to the marriage of any benefit (for example, a pension) which, by reason of the dissolution or annulment of the marriage that party will lose the chance of acquiring.

63     The Court of Appeal stated in ATE v ATD[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4), that this Court “cannot – and ought not to – order nominal maintenance automatically or as a matter of course… the Court has to examine closely all the facts and circumstances of the case before deciding whether or not to award nominal maintenance in order to preserve the wife’s right to apply for maintenance in future.”

64     Of particular relevance to the present case, the Court of Appeal added that it will not suffice for the wife to argue – without more – that she is entitled to an order if nominal maintenance simply because her situation might change in future. Indeed, it has, in general, never been the duty of the Courts to compensate parties for the vicissitudes of life. It would also result (in substance and effect) in making the husband a general insurer of sorts. This would be wholly contrary to the very purpose of awarding maintenance to a former wife in the first place.

## Conclusion on maintenance of the wife

65     As stated previously herein, I found that the wife’s income was $2,500, and the husband’s was $5,000.

66     The plaintiff was and is not incapable of supporting herself. She was capable, resourceful and energetic. She had a job before she married, earning US$4,500 a month, and there was no ostensible reason why she would not be able to similar find employment again. According to her own evidence, she was able to organise the relocation to Norway, adapted herself there and learned a new language. She impressed me as a capable woman who would have been well able to maintain herself, and very likely succeed on her own, even if she had not married the husband. This was a 6-year marriage, and this was not such a long period for her to have become completely dependent upon him for support, and not be able to regain her ability to support herself. She was 42 years old, and had more than 2 decades ahead before retirement age.

67     I found that the wife had not proved on a balance of probabilities that she was in need of maintenance from the husband.

68     Applying the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in ATE v ATD, I also found that the circumstances of the present case were not so exceptional such that nominal maintenance should be preserved for the plaintiff.

69     In view of the above, I ordered that there should be no maintenance payable by the husband to the wife.

## Costs

70     Both parties were legally aided. The wife sought an order for costs. It was not evident if this request was instructed or approved by the Director of Legal Aid.

71     Under section 16 of the Legal Aid and Advice Act, as a legally aided person, the wife could have been entitled to an order for costs from the husband-

16.—(1)    In proceedings to which an aided person is a party, the Court shall make, in favour of the aided person, the like order for costs (except against another aided person) as the Court would have made in favour of the aided person had he not been an aided person, and in proceedings in which costs follow the event an aided person shall (except against another aided person) be entitled to costs in the like manner as if he were not an aided person, notwithstanding that no amount is or will be payable by the aided person, or that the costs are in excess of the amount which is or will be payable by the aided person.

72     However, under section 12 of the Legal Aid and Advice Act, as the husband was himself legally aided, he was not liable for costs to the wife-

(4)    Where any Grant of Aid is so filed, the aided person —

(c)    shall not, except where express provision is made in this Act, be liable for costs to any other party in any proceedings to which the Grant of Aid relates.

73     Under section 14(1) however, this Court may order the husband to pay the costs of the Director (who was acting for the wife as well) if it appeared that the grant of aid had been obtained by fraud or misrepresentation.

14.— (1)    Where it appears to a Court that a Grant of Aid has been obtained by fraud or misrepresentation, the Court may order the aided person to pay the costs of the Director or of the solicitor who acted for him or the costs of the other party, or the costs of both the Director or the solicitor and the other party.

74     I did not find any evidence that proved that the husband had obtained legal aid by fraud or misrepresentation. Such an allegation was not proved on a balance of probabilities by the wife.

75     In any event, I was aware that any costs order was likely to be paid for from the matrimonial asset pool anyway[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5), and even then, to the Director of Legal Aid. I did not see why the matrimonial asset pool should be unnecessarily drained for this purpose.

76     Therefore, I made no order as to costs.
