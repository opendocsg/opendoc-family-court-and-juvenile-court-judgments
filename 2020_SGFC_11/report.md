Family Law – Ancillary Matters – section 112, 113, 124 & 127 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353)

24 January 2020

### District Judge Cheryl Koh:

## A.    Introduction

1       These are the ancillary matters arising out of a divorce involving: (a) the division of matrimonial assets; (b) maintenance of the plaintiff wife (the “**Wife**”); (c) custody, care and control and access of one child (the “**Child**”); and (d) maintenance of the Child.

2       On 14 October 2019, I ordered that by consent, there be no maintenance for the Wife. I further ordered that:

> (a)     there be joint custody and joint care and control of the Child;

> (b)     each party to maintain the Child when the Child is under his or her care and control. In addition, the defendant husband (the “**Husband**”) to pay the Wife the sum of $250.00 per month as maintenance of the Child; and

> (c)     with regard to the three matrimonial properties, namely, a Singapore HDB, a Singapore condominium and a Malaysian property, the Husband shall retain the Singapore HDB with no consideration to the Wife. The Wife shall retain the Singapore condominium with no consideration to the Husband. The Wife shall transfer her title in the Malaysian property to the Husband with no consideration to her. Parties were to retain all their own other assets.

> My full orders are set out in \[33\] herein.

3       The Wife has appealed against the part of my decision relating to joint custody, joint care and control and maintenance of the Child. The Husband has appealed against the whole of my decision.

## B.    Background facts

4       Parties were married on 21 December 2014. On 7 March 2017, the Wife left the Singapore HDB with the Child. The Wife commenced divorce proceedings on 12 February 2018. Interim Judgment was granted on an uncontested basis on 6 December 2018 on both parties’ unreasonable behaviour. The marriage therefore lasted about four years.

5       The Husband is 45 years old and working as a part time driving instructor. The Wife is 40 years old and working as a teacher. She is a subject head in the Chinese language. The Child is the only child to the marriage, a boy born on 11 October 2015 and aged about 4 years old at the time of the ancillary matters.

6       There were related proceedings in OSG No. 103 of 2017, which was commenced by the Husband on 18 May 2017 after the Wife had left the Singapore HDB with the Child on 7 March 2017. The Husband sought for care and control of the Child with reasonable access to the Wife. During mediation, parties agreed that the Husband was to have supervised visitation to the Child at the Divorce Support Specialist Agency (DSSA). However, parties were unable to agree on final arrangements for the Child, and OSG No. 103 of 2017 was fixed for hearing. Upon a review of DSSA reports dated 2 November 2017 and 17 January 2018, I made an interim order on 20 February 2018 for the Husband to have unsupervised access to the Child with supervised handovers at the DSSA. On 24 April 2018, after review of a further DSSA report dated 20 March 2018, I made final orders for care and control of the Child to remain with the Wife, with unsupervised access to the Husband from Saturdays 10.00AM until Sundays 11.00AM with effect from 5 May 2018, and Fridays after nursery to Sundays 11.00AM with effect from 5 July 2018. Parties’ present divorce case was thereafter docketed before me.

7       The affidavits and submissions filed by the parties are as follows:

> (a)     the Husband’s 1st Affidavit of Assets and Means (“**AOM**”) filed on 14 February 2019;

> (b)     the Wife’s 1st AOM filed on 14 February 2019;

> (c)     the Husband’s 2nd AOM filed on 10 July 2019;

> (d)     the Wife’s 2nd AOM filed on 10 June 2019;

> (e)     the Husband’s Submissions filed on 05 August 2019;

> (f)     the Wife’s Submissions filed on 05 August 2019;

> (g)     the Husband’s Reply Submissions filed on 30 September 2019; and

> (h)     the Wife’s Reply Submissions filed on 30 September 2019.

8       I shall deal with the three contested issues of division of matrimonial assets, custody, care and control and access of the Child, and maintenance of the Child sequentially.

## C.    Grounds of Decision

### Issue 1:   Division of matrimonial assets

9       In determining what would be a just and equitable division of matrimonial assets, it would entail an application of the structured approach in the Court of Appeal’s decision of _ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span>. This involves delineating the matrimonial pool, ascribing a ratio for parties’ direct financial contributions and indirect contributions, and deriving each party’s average percentage contributions with any further adjustments.

##### Value of the matrimonial pool

10     I find the value of the matrimonial pool to be about $1.5 million, computed as follows:

##### Direct contributions to the properties

11     It is undisputed that parties made direct contributions towards most of the assets held in their own names, including that the Husband made 100% direct contributions towards the Singapore HDB solely owned by him. However, for the Singapore condominium and the Malaysian property held in the Wife’s name, parties made joint direct contributions.

12     For the Singapore condominium, I find that the ratio of parties’ direct contributions to be 67:33 in favour of the Wife:

##### Direct contributions to the matrimonial pool

14     This means that in terms of direct contributions for the Singapore condominium (with a net value of $536,428.33) held by the Wife, 67% or $359,406.98 is attributable to the Wife and 33% or $177,021.35 is attributable to the Husband.

15     As for direct contributions for the Malaysia property (with a net value of $406,348.02) held by the Wife, 51.5% or $209,269.23 is attributable to the Wife and 48.5% or $197,078.79 is attributable to the Husband.

16     The Wife’s direct contributions to the matrimonial pool is thus $834,436.04 \[her sole assets of $1,208,536.18, less the Husband’s direct contributions to her sole assets of $374,100.14 ($177,021.35 + $197,078.79)\]. This translates to 54% of the matrimonial pool ($834,436.04/$1,544,349.80).

17     The Husband’s direct contributions to the matrimonial pool is thus $709,913.76 (his sole assets of $335,813.62, plus his direct contributions to the Wife’s sole assets of $374,100.14). This translates to 46% of the matrimonial pool ($709,913.76 /$1,544,349.80).

##### Indirect contributions

18     The Wife submitted that indirect contributions should be 65:35 in her favour. She argued that she took care of the household and cared for the Child whilst working full time, whilst the Husband bummed around purportedly working as a part time driving instructor. The Husband submitted that indirect contributions should be 90:10 in his favour. He argued that he made indirect financial contributions towards the three matrimonial properties, attended to the repairs and maintenance of these properties, and took care of the Child whilst working part time.

19     I considered that parties lived together for barely over 2 years of marriage before physical separation, and the marriage only lasted for 4 years until Interim Judgment. During this time, parties had a child and the Husband helped take care of the Child and household, whilst the Wife worked full time and also cared for the Child when she was not working. In these circumstances, I find it fair to attribute indirect contributions equally to parties for this short marriage.

##### Final ratio

20     Both parties attributed equal weightage to direct and indirect contributions. Applying the approach in _ANJ_, I find that parties are entitled to the matrimonial pool in the ratio of 52:48 in favour of the Wife:

21     This meant that the Wife is entitled to 52% of the matrimonial pool, or the sum of $803,061.89 (52% of /$1,544,349.80). As she has sole assets of $1,208,536.18, she should pay the sum of $405,474.29 ($1,208,536.18 less $803,061.89) to the Husband. Given the Husband’s preference to retain the Singapore HDB and to have the Malaysian property for his retirement, I ordered the Wife to transfer the Malaysian property (with a net value of $406,348.02) to the Husband, with no consideration to the Wife. Parties should then retain all their own other assets, including that the Husband shall retain the Singapore HDB and the Wife shall retain the Singapore condominium, with no consideration to each other. In my view, this is a just and equitable division of matrimonial assets as parties essentially are taking back what they have contributed in terms of direct contributions to the matrimonial pool for this short marriage of 4 years.

### Issue 2:   Custody, care & control and access of the Child

22     Parties agreed to joint custody of the Child. However, the Wife sought for an additional order that in the event parties failed to reach agreement on the Child’s education, the Wife should be given final decision. I declined to make such a qualification to an order for joint custody, as it is premature to assume at this stage that parties would not be able to agree on the Child’s future education.

23     The Wife further sought for sole care and control of the Child. The Wife argued that she was the primary caregiver of the Child, notwithstanding that she was working full-time and the Husband was working part time. Despite the orders made in OSG No. 103 of 2017, the Husband would force the Child to go for unnecessary body checkups, inspect every part of the Child’s body and take photographs for the purpose of these divorce proceedings. The Husband is self-centered, delusional and did not prioritise the Child’s welfare, as evident from his position that the Child is not able to pee and poop on his own and that if he were granted care and control of the Child, he would remove the Child from nursery and teach him to use the toilet. The Husband also wanted to remove the Child from nursey to teach the Child swimming, hill climbing, basketball, football, martial arts, cycling and all other physical activities, without mention of any plans for the Child’s intellectual growth.

24     The Husband also sought for sole care and control of the Child. He argued that he was the sole caregiver of the Child, as he became a house husband to care for the Child and the Wife worked full time as a teacher. He cared for the Child from around 6.45AM when the Wife left for work, until 6.00PM to 7.00PM when she returned from work. He argued he was capable of caring for the Child. On the other hand, the Wife was clueless on how to handle the Child, was unhygienic and unclean, consumed expired and junk food, and was negligent with the Child. He exhibited numerous photographs such as of the Child suffering from various bites, having blood in his stools, the Wife leaving dirt on dishes and in the toilet, and the Wife keeping expired food in the fridge.

25     In my view, it would be in the best interests of the Child for parties to have joint care and control of the Child at this stage of the Child’s life. _First_, upon reviewing the various DSSA reports dated 2 November 2017, 17 January 2018, 20 March 2018, 4 May 2018 and 5 July 2018, I was satisfied that the Husband has successfully rebuilt the relationship with the Child and bonded very well with him, notwithstanding separation from the Child for over 7 months and the Child’s initial clinginess to the Wife. The Husband also has a strong ability to care for the basic needs of the Child, teach the Child about right and wrong behaviour, and engage in positive play with the Child. The Child called the Husband “Papa”, there was laughter in their play, and the Husband was attentive and respectful to the Child’s responses and movements. The Husband was mindful to feed the Child to drink water and to encourage the Child to keep toys after play. When the Child threw an occasional tantrum by throwing the toys around or playing with his saliva, the Husband would stop the Child and the Child would listen. The Husband prepared milk for the Child, encouraged the Child to take a nap after drinking milk, and carried the Child to soothe him back to sleep when the Child cried. When the Husband transited to unsupervised access with supervised exchange at the DSSA, the Child eventually walked towards the Husband smiling upon arrival at the DSSA. The Child also did not display any distress upon return to the DSSA, and it appeared that the Child’s alone time with the Husband has settled well into the Child’s routine.

26      _Second_, the Husband worked part-time as a driving instructor and is able to manage his time such that he could spend all his time with the Child when the Child is under his care. On the other hand, the Wife worked full time and left the Child in nursery for full days on weekdays. Instead of spending full days at a nursery being cared for by third parties in a large group setting, it would benefit the Child to receive individual care and undivided attention from an available and attentive stay-home parent. During the marriage, the Husband was the one who cared for the Child alone without any additional help on weekdays, from 6.00AM-7.00AM when the Wife went to work, up till 4.00PM-7.00PM when the Wife returned from work. He was able to arrange his driving lessons outside of the Wife’s working hours. It is observed that both parties appeared to be equally non-reliant on assistance from family members or a maid to care for the Child on a daily basis. To address the Wife’s concerns that the Husband would keep the Child away from socializing with other children his age or from education in his current nursery, I ordered the Husband to ensure that the Child attended his current nursery for at least half a day when the Child was under his care.

27      _Third_, I understood parties’ apparent difficulties in communication with each other and in co-parenting for the Child. The Wife felt that the Husband nit-picked and was obsessive over the Child’s health and hygiene, whilst the Husband wondered how the Child could suffer so many insect bites and bruises, fall sick so frequently and even have blood in his stools, etc.. I was however not persuaded that parties’ conflicting styles overrode the Husband’s strong willingness and ability to care for, nurture and bond with the Child such that he should be denied joint care and control. In a bid to manage parties’ conflict, I ordered the Husband to refrain from videoing or photographing the Child for the sole purpose of producing the same in court to challenge the Wife's caregiving abilities. Regardless of any concerns, it is not in the Child’s interests to be subject to repeated body examinations or scrutiny by the Husband. I would strongly urge and caution the Husband to bear this in mind moving forward, to obviate the possibility that the Child starts to display discomfort and resistance towards the examining parent, as I have seen in other similar cases. If the Child suffered from genuine medical issues, either parent should seek professional help or opinion. In this aspect, to manage any disagreement on the Child’s medical issues, I further ordered parties to keep each other updated on these issues or to permit the medical doctor to update the other party of these issues directly. Further, save where the medical doctor expressly required either party to follow up on these issues, each party shall refrain from requiring the other party to follow up on the same. I also ordered parties to attend counselling at the DSSA, in a hope that parties would gain insight to become more child-centric and enable them to co-parent more effectively.

28      _Fourth_, the Child is not yet of school-going age, and did not require a fixed or singular home base as much as older school-going children may do for the purpose of receiving a more stable, grounded and holistic education with absent conflicting educative styles. Joint care and control of the Child is not something cast in stone, and may be subject to change at a later time if for instance, the Child becomes of school-going age and he required a more constant or solitary home base to be better able to focus on his education. At this stage, however, when the Child is 4 years old, such a need for a singular home base with non-conflicting educative styles did not feature as prominently and was subject to the interests of the Child to receive individuated and undivided love and care from both parents. It is noted that the Wife felt the Husband would overly focus on physical activities such as swimming and cycling, instead of pursuing activities of intellectual growth. It must however be borne in mind that the Child would receive educative lessons in at least half-day nursery when the Child is under the Husband’s care. The Wife would also be able to engage the Child in more educative and intellectual activities when the Child is under her care for almost five days per week (inclusive of Wednesdays 1.00PM or after school onwards, and also inclusive of Sunday mornings till 11.00AM).

29     In these circumstances, I awarded the Husband care of the Child from Sundays 11.00AM until Wednesdays before nursery or 1.00PM if there is no nursery, and the Wife care of the Child from Wednesdays after nursery or 1.00PM if there is no nursery, until Sundays 11.00AM. I shifted more of weekday time to the Husband as he had flexible working arrangements, and more of weekend time to the Wife since she worked full time on weekdays. As for my other orders on public holidays and Chinese New Year, time is split equally between both parents.

### Issue 3:   Maintenance for the Child

30     The Wife sought for a monthly sum of about $700.00 per month (being 50% of the Child’s claimed expenses) from the Husband. At the hearing, the Wife’s counsel sought $289.10 per month, with an order for parties to share the Child’s education and medical expenses equally. The Husband argued that if he had sole care and control of the Child, he would solely maintain the Child.

31     As I have ordered joint care of the Child, I ordered that each party maintain the Child when under his or her care. Further, I ordered the Husband to pay the Wife the sum of $250.00 as contribution towards the Child’s school fees and expenses. In this regard, I bore in mind that the Wife is a much higher income earner than the Husband. She earned a net monthly income of about $6,000.00. The Husband is a part time driving instructor claiming to earn around $500.00 to $700.00 per month. Parties’ income disparity has always been the _status quo_ during the marriage. This is partially because the Husband is living off inheritance from his late mother.

32     I further bore in mind that the Child’s expenses as claimed by the Wife are not significant. They comprise of food of $200.00, clothing/diaper of $125.50, medical of $65.00, personal insurance of $232.65, school expenses of $20.00, school fees of $451.90, and enrichment or tuition of $296.00. The Child is however not yet enrolled in any enrichment or tuition, and the Wife has not explained what the insurance is for. The Husband’s contribution of $250.00 per month towards the Child’s school expenses is therefore reasonable in the meantime.
