Family Law – Guardianship of Infants Act – best interest of child – custody care and control – access to child – supervised access – overseas access – joint custody

28 June 2019

### District Judge Sheik Mustafa:

## Introduction

1       In this case the mother of a child commenced an originating summons regarding custody care and control of the child. I heard both parties’ counsel, and ordered for both parents of the child to have joint custody of the child, and for them to share care and control. I ordered several detailed arrangements regarding the parents’ transactions relating to the child, the principal ones being that the mother is to have care of the child for up to 2 weeks each month, for which she is to give notice to the father. I also ordered that neither parent is to bring the child out of Singapore without the prior written consent of the remaining party, which shall be given if certain details of the travel are furnished 30 clear days in advance, that a security deposit is be furnished for the travel, and that a copy of the child’s passport be left with the remaining party.

2       The father has appealed against the judgment. I now give my reasons for it.

## Background Facts

3       On the cornerstone facts, the parties’ versions do not diverge substantially.

4       The mother is a xxx-year old Russian woman. She is a permanent resident of Singapore.

5       The father is a xxx-year old Singapore male citizen. The couple married in Singapore in xxx 2012. He is the sponsor of the mother’s permanent residency.

6       The child, a daughter, was born in xxx. She is the couple’s only child. She is xxx years old. She is both a Russian and Singaporean citizen.

7       The mother was a stay-home mother. Except for occasional modelling jobs, she did not work throughout the marriage. The father worked in the family business that runs food and beverage establishments. He had become a bankrupt in 2013.

8       After the father’s bankruptcy, the family moved to Jakarta and lived there for more than 2 years. The family moved back to Singapore in February 2018. They occupied a bedroom in the father’s parents’ house.

9       The couple’s relationship had been deteriorating, and after the return to Singapore, the mother asked the father for a divorce. The father brought the child to Malaysia. According to the mother, he threatened not to come back. A few days later, he returned to Singapore without the child. The mother claims that the father chased her out of the house on 11 June 2018, with only the dress she was wearing, her identity card and a debit card. The father claims that the mother left home on her own accord. What is material, however, is the agreed fact that the parties have lived separately since then on.

10     The father brought the child back to Singapore on 21 June 2018. A few days later, the mother filed the present originating summons praying for care and control of the child, with access to the father. She also filed a separate summons requesting a stop order, which was resolved by consent[^1] on 12 July 2018, where both of them agreed not to remove the child from Singapore or from the mother’s residence, as well as for the child’s passports and travel documents to be held by the mother’s solicitors.

11     The mother alleges that the father has been alienating her from the child. The couple’s relationship became worse when the father learnt that the mother had embarked on a new relationship. Both parents applied for personal protection orders on behalf of the child, and both of which were withdrawn. The mother claims that the father blocked the child’s communication with her and her family.

12     As a result of negotiations by their lawyers, the couple agreed to an order where the mother was to see the child for limited times on 29 November, 6 December and 13 December 2018. These were to be on Thursdays, after school.

13     The father wrote to the Immigration authorities to cancel the mother’s permanent residence. He was not successful. Nevertheless, the mother resolved to leave Singapore as she did not have means to continue to reside here, but she also wished to visit the child in Singapore regularly, as well as to travel with the child.

14     No divorce proceedings have commenced. The effect of the order to be made herein would be to govern the couple’s relationship in connection with the child, until such time that the marriage is dissolved.

15     In these proceedings, the mother prayed for –

a.     joint custody of the child, but for care and control to be shared,

b.     the mother to keep the child’s birth certificate and Russian passport, and for the father to keep the child’s Singapore passport,

c.     the parties to consult with each other and seek each other’s consent to the major decisions regarding the child’s welfare, including matters pertaining to her education, choice of school, religion and citizenship status, and not make unilateral decisions for the child,

d.     both parties to have the right to be designated on the child’s records as a person to be notified in the case of medical emergency,

e.     both parties to have the right to contact the child’s school directly to be provided with updates on the child and to attend at school activities,

f.     both parties to keep each other informed if the child falls ill, and if the child is hospitalised, both to be allowed to see the child and speak to her doctors,

g.     that during the school term, upon being given to the father 2 weeks’ notice, the mother shall have care of the child for 2 weeks per month. The mother shall collect the child from school and return her there,

h.     that during school holidays, the mother shall have care of the child for the last 2 weeks of the mid-year school holidays, and for the last 3 weeks of the year-end school holidays,

i.     that the father shall have care of the child for the first 2 weeks of the mid-year school holidays and the first 3 weeks of the year-end school holidays,

j.     that the parties be allowed to bring the child out of Singapore during their respective care periods,

k.     the travelling party shall give written notice of the intention to travel with the child at least 1 month in advance, with details of the travel,

l.     that such travel be at the traveling party’s own cost,

m.     that the father is to unblock the mother and her family from the Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger applications to enable them to contact the child,

n.     that the parent not having care of the child be entitled to call or Skype her every day at 8 pm for up to 15 minutes.

16     The father did not file his own summons. Instead, in his affidavit, he submitted his own requests –

a.     That he be given daily care and control of the child,

b.     That the mother shall have access to the child once a week on either Saturday or Sunday from 9.30 am to 6pm, subject to the following –

i.       The mother is to bring the child to all her existing and future activities,

ii.       That during the access period, only the mother and her family members be present, in particular the mother should not allow the child to have contact with her boyfriend or his relatives,

iii.       The mother shall surrender the child’s Singapore and Russian passports, birth certificate and health booklet, and the couple’s marriage certificate,

iv.       That such access shall be cancelled if it falls on Chinese New Year’s Eve or the Chinese New Year, or Christmas Eve or Christmas.

17     The father argues that shared care and control is not suitable because the parents have conflicting parenting styles. He claims that he comes from a “traditional Chinese which emphasises moral values, filial piety, discipline, thriftiness and such other characteristics”, whereas the mother is a Russian who, before the marriage, had never been exposed to Chinese culture. He also accuses the mother’s lifestyle as being a freelance model who enjoys the high life, partying and socialising, and constantly taking luxury vacations. He argues that care and control ought to be solely granted to him.

18     The father also argues that the relationship between him and the mother is acrimonious. He denies that he blocked the mother from contacting the child. He accuses the mother of abandoning the child because of differences between him and her. He states that he found it unacceptable that she found a new partner in such a short period. He submits that it is obvious that there can be little or no cooperation between the parents.

19     The father argues that overnight access is inappropriate as the mother has not fixed accommodation in Singapore, and that the mother lives with a new partner.

20     The father objects to the mother having overseas access. He argues that the mother has made it clear she intends to leave Singapore, and that the only reason for her to come to Singapore is to see the child. He submits that there is a genuine and real concern that the child may not be returned to Singapore. he points out that in previous occasions when the child travelled to Russia, it was always accompanied by the father. Now that the marriage had broken down, he believes that the mother may attempt to “one-up” him by bringing the child overseas and not returning her to Singapore.

21     The father argues that she does not have her own place to stay in Singapore. The mother claims that she is residing with her new partner, and that if that turns out to be not permanent, then she would return to Russia. She would then come to Singapore to exercise her care and control times with the child by staying at a hotel or a friend’s residence. The father contends that it is sufficient for the mother be given access to the child when she is in Singapore, and there is no need for an order of shared care and control.

22     At the hearing, both parties were represented by counsel.

## Issues

23     Having found the facts above, I examined the issues of the case –

a.     Should the mother be granted shared care and control of the child?

b.     If so, what would be a suitable arrangement for the child?

c.     Should the parties be allowed to bring the child out of the court’s jurisdiction? If so, on what terms?

## Applicable Legal Principles

24     The primary law defining the care of children springs from section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act –

**“3**.    Where in any proceedings before any court the custody or upbringing of an infant or the administration of any property belonging to or held in trust for an infant or the application of the income thereof is in question, the court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration and save in so far as such welfare otherwise requires the father of an infant shall not be deemed to have any right superior to that of the mother in respect of such custody, administration or application nor shall the mother be deemed to have any claim superior to that of the father.”

25     The law defining custody of children was succinctly described by the Court of Appeal in the case of _CX v. CY_[^2], that –

“For the development of the law of custody, we deem it necessary to lay down a general definition detailing the scope of each order. Our observation is that in most custody cases, parties are simply concerned over which parent has care and control and access. Parties labour under the mistaken impression that if they are denied custody, they will be unable to see their child anymore and will lose all contact with the child. We regret to say that some family law practitioners further muddy the waters by failing to advise their clients adequately as to what “custody orders” actually entail. If parties are assured of their respective rights to care and control and access, we foresee lesser tension and acrimony in disputes over custody issues.

Adopting this narrow definition of “custody”, it appears that there will be relatively few occasions where significant and longer-term decisions need to be made for the child. Hence, parties will seldom need to come together to make a joint decision even if joint or no custody orders were granted. We should add that it is an almost impossible task for us to lay down an exhaustive list of matters which will fall under the concept of residual custody. The line is not always clear as to what matters would be considered the important and longer-term decisions concerning the upbringing and welfare of a child. It suffices to say that decisions pertaining to religion, education and major healthcare issues would fall into such a category.

In this day and age, we feel that the preferable position in the law of custody is that advocated by the father, i.e. to preserve the concept of joint parental responsibility, even if the parties may harbour some acrimony towards each other. Often, advocates of the _Helen Ho_ position rely on the acrimonious relationship of the parties to argue that joint custody will be detrimental to the welfare of the child. However, they fail to appreciate the fact that some degree of acrimony is to be expected when parties are undergoing the stresses of a marital breakdown. As allegations of wrongdoings and breaches of fidelity can be hurtful, the time when the marriage breaks down may not be the best time to assess whether both parents can co-operate for the rest of the child’s life. We believe that the fear that parties cannot co-operate may be overstated. It is a quantum leap in logic to assume that the parties’ inability to co-operate during the period of divorce or custody proceedings equates to an inability to agree on the future long-term interests of the child.

…

Adopting the view that joint or no custody orders should be granted unless there are exceptional circumstances, we were of the opinion that the judge was not plainly wrong in granting joint custody, notwithstanding the allegations and counter-allegations made by each party.”

26     The Court of Appeal in _ZO v. ZP_[^3], added as follows:

“… The input by both parents furnishes a balance that enhances the development of that child (or those children, as the case may be) until adulthood is reached. In contrast, the exclusion of one of the parents in this particular regard would – absent an exceptional reason – contribute towards a less balanced as well as less rounded development of the child (or children) concerned. Hence, the pronouncement made by the court in _CX v CY_ that a joint (or no) custody order would henceforth be the norm rather than the exception. We could not agree more.”

27     In _AQL v AQM[^4]_, the High Court clarified the meaning of shared care and control thus:

“ …. an order for shared care and control means that the child spends time living with each parent, who then becomes the child’s primary caregiver for the duration that the child lives with him (or her). The right to make the day-to-day decisions on the upbringing of the child therefore rests with the parent the child is presently living with. In the context of shared care and control, it becomes meaningless to speak of ‘access’. This is because the child effectively has two homes and two primary caregivers.

The practical effect of an order of shared care and control means that the child will spend roughly equal amounts of time (including overnight) with each parent. An order of shared care and control can take different forms depending on the circumstances. This is illustrated by two High Court decisions where shared care and control was ordered: in _AHJ v AHK_ the child would spend Saturdays 8.00pm to Wednesday 11.30am with the mother, and the rest of the week with the father; in _AKF v AKG_ the same learned judge held that the children would spend alternate fortnights with each parent.”[^5]

28     Where there is a clash of parenting styles, shared care and control for a young child may not be suitable –

“When a child is very young, a strong clash in parenting styles is something that is relevant when deciding whether shared care and control should be ordered. One may expect that a young child will be considerably stressed if forced to adapt to different expectations and approaches every few days. Such stain cannot be beneficial at such an early stage in the child’s development.”[^6]

## Findings

29     Based on the foregoing facts and the applicable principles of law to the issues, I found that the mother ought to be granted shared care and control of the child.

30     I find this to be in the best interest of the child. I took into account that the mother had been living at home with the child for most of the time she was residing with the father, and the natural conclusion is that she was the main or primary caregiver of the child until her departure from the home.

31     The is no adequate indication that the mother is an unfit parent or is likely to be so. There is no evidence to show that the mother did not adequately care for the child, even though she did have assistance of a domestic maid to do so.

32     Having been in the care of the mother for most of 6 years, it is the child’s best interest to continue to maintain this relationship after the separation of her parents. A shared care and control order will best facilitate this.

33     The separation between the parents is recent. This is a crucial factor. It is not a situation where the child has been alienated from her mother to the extent that ties have broken between them.

34     The father’s objection to shared care and control is principally based on the fact that the mother is now residing with another man. In the absence of any other evidence, this is, in itself, not an adequate reason to defeat the interest of the child to have care and control of her own self shared equally between her two parents, as she had been accustomed to all her life.

35     Having found that shared care and control is in the best interest of the child, I find that the mother’s proposal that the parental time be split between the two parents is fair, and workable. It minimises the loss of contact the child would suffer as a result from her parents’ separation. An arrangement where she remains in the care and control of solely her father is too much of a departure from the presence and care that the child had enjoyed of both her parents before their separation.

36     The father’s argument that there will be a clash of parenting styles is not persuasive. It is obvious that the parents are of different cultures. This is a fact that the child was born into. Merely because the parents are of different ethnicities and cultures does not mean that there is a clash in parental style to the extent that it would not be in the child’s best interest. If that were so, then every pair of parents of different ethnicities is doomed to failure.

37     I considered the father’s proposal for the mother to have access to the child instead of shared care and control because she does not have a permanent place to stay. I did not find this proposal satisfactory nor fair. The mother is a foreign spouse without family in Singapore other than the father and the child. She clearly stands at a disadvantage when it comes to acquiring her own residence. If the father was concerned about the mother’s accommodation, there is nothing to prevent him furnishing her with adequate maintenance to rent one. There is no evidence that he has done so.

38     Therefore, I ordered as follows –

a.     The plaintiff and the defendant shall have shared care and control of the child according to the terms stated below.

b.     During school term, the plaintiff shall have care of the child for up to 2 weeks per month. During school holidays in 2019 and in odd-numbered years thereafter, the plaintiff shall have care of the child for the last 2 weeks of the mid-year school holidays, and the last 3 weeks of the year-end school holidays. During school holidays in 2020 and in even-numbered years thereafter, the plaintiff shall have care of the child for the first 2 weeks of the mid-year school holidays, and the first 3 weeks of the year-end school holidays. For the avoidance of doubt, the defendant shall have care of the child at all other times that the plaintiff does not have care of the child. “School term” and “school holidays” shall be construed to be the dates so declared by the Ministry of Education.

c.     The plaintiff shall give no less than 14 days’ notice to the defendant before she commences the said care of the child stating when she will collect the child to commence the care and when she will return the child. The plaintiff shall collect and send the child to and from school for this purpose.

39     The child has a close relationship with both sides of her family. She had been to Russia and met her mother’s family before. It is in her best interest to continue to have this relationship continue. The breakdown in her parents’ relationship ought not be allowed to cloud or impinge on this. She is as much a Russian as she is Singaporean. She has every right to experience and realise that inalienable Russian aspect of herself. Based on this premise, there is no reason to justify the child not being able to visit her family in Russia.

40     The only concern on the child going abroad to Russia is the possibility of her not being returned to Singapore. The mother has no history of abducting or attempting to abduct the child. There is no reasonable basis to presume that she would do so now. There is therefore no reason to disallow the child to travel to Russia with her mother.

41     In any event, as a safeguard, I ordered that if either parent wishes to travel with the child, he/she must first provide information on the child’s travel as well as provide security for the child’s safe return.

42     In view of the above, I ordered as follows –

a.     Both the plaintiff and the defendant shall not by him/herself, his/her agents or servants, bring the child out of Singapore without the prior written consent of the other party or an order of Court. The written consent shall be given by the remaining party to the party intending to bring the child out of Singapore if he/she has provided –

i.       30 clear days of notice to the remaining party of the intention to so bring the child out of Singapore, stating the flight or transport details, itinerary, accommodation details and contact numbers while overseas,

ii.       a security deposit to the remaining party of S$10,000 if the travel is within ASEAN, and S$25,000 if the travel to any other country, which shall be refunded to the party giving the security upon the handover of the child on return to the remaining party, and

iii.       a photocopy to the remaining party, of the passport that the child will be using for the travel.

43     After this appeal was filed, upon the father’s application, I ordered that, pending the outcome of this appeal, neither the father nor the mother shall bring the child out of Singapore without the prior written consent of the other party, or an Order of Court.

## Conclusion

44     It is evident that both parents love and care for the child very much. It is clear that in her, they are trying to salvage the best of what they can from their shipwrecked relationship. The separation is raw, and fired by strong feelings towards at each other. The first and paramount duty of this court, however, is to give the best for the child, who is innocent of these goings-on, to help her continue to sail on her parent’s love and care uninterrupted, and navigate through this straitened channel with as little turbulence as possible. I found that from her point of view, it is best that she should continue to have equal time with each parent, and be able to maintain contact with both her Russian and Chinese roots.
