Family law – Matrimonial assets – Division – Family law – Maintenance of children

29 April 2019

### District Judge Jinny Tan:

## Introduction

1       The Plaintiff (Husband) and the Defendant (Wife) in these proceedings were married on xxx 2003. They have two children, who are 13 and 11 years old. The Husband is 41+ years old and the Wife is 40+ years old.

2       On 16 March 2018, the Husband commenced these proceedings on the basis that parties have lived apart for a continuous period of at least 4 years preceding the filing of the Writ. Based on the Statement of Particulars filed, the parties started living apart since 2009 when the Wife moved out of the matrimonial property and went back to Indonesia. The Husband remained in Singapore. The Wife did not contest the divorce proceedings and Interim Judgment was obtained on 21 May 2018.

3       On 14 June 2018, the parties were able to come to an agreement in relation to the children’s issues and recorded a consent order. They agreed that parties shall have joint custody of the children, with sole care and control to be granted to the Husband. Singapore was agreed to be the principal place of residence of the children. In the consent order, parties also came to an agreement on the specific access arrangements.

4       The other ancillary matters, relating to the division of assets and maintenance for the wife and children were adjourned for hearing before this Court.

5       At the hearing, the Wife’s counsel informed the Court that she was not pursuing the claim for maintenance for herself.

## Orders made

6       After hearing the parties’ submissions, and after considering all the evidence before me, I made the following orders:

a)     The Wife to transfer her share interest and title of the matrimonial property to the Husband, with the Husband paying her the sum equivalent to 12% of the net value of the matrimonial home. The transfer was to take place within 4 months from today. Parties were to obtain a joint valuation of the property. Costs of the valuation to be borne equally. In the meantime, from now until the transfer, the Husband was to be responsible for all the property related expenses, including the mortgage. The Husband was also to be responsible to pay for the costs and expenses of the transfer. The Wife’s 12% share would be calculated based on the valuation less $262,370 (which was the outstanding loan as at 13 July 2018).

b)     If the Husband did not wish to proceed with the transfer for whatever reason, the Husband must inform the Wife of his intention within 1 month. Then, the property was to be sold within 9 months. The sale proceeds, after payment of outstanding loan and expenses relating to the sale, was to be divided in the proportion 88% to the Husband and 12% to the Wife, and parties shall be responsible for their own CPF refunds. In the meantime, from now until the sale, the Husband was to be responsible for all the property related expenses, including the mortgage.

c)     Apart from the above, each to keep own assets.

d)     By consent, no maintenance is payable by the Husband to the Wife.

e)     The Wife shall pay the sum of S$1,450/month for the maintenance of the two children from 15 April 2019 and thereafter the 15th day of each month. This sum was to be deposited into the Husband’s designated bank account.

f)     Each party to bear own costs.

g)     Liberty to apply.

## Appeal

7       Both parties have now appealed against part of my decision. The Wife’s appeal relates to the orders on the division of assets and the maintenance payable by her for the children. The Husband’s appeal relates to the orders made on the division of assets.

8       I now give my reasons for the decision I made.

## The parties

9       The Husband is 41+ years old, and he works as a consultant in a software company. He earns a monthly gross income of $8,772.83[^1].

10     The Wife is 40+ years old and she is a Manager, assisting her father in running a garment business in Indonesia. Her average monthly income is about S$6,500[^2].

11     They have two children, one born in 2005 and another 2007.

## The marriage and the proceedings thus far

12     The parties were married on xxx 2003.

13     It is not disputed that since 2009, the Wife moved out of the matrimonial home and back to her parents’ home in Indonesia. She has been residing there ever since.

14     The children initially stayed with the Wife in Indonesia when she went back. However, sometime in 2010/2011, the children returned to Singapore. Since then, the children had been in the care of the Husband, and during school holidays, the children would go to Indonesia to spend time with the Wife.

15     On 16 March 2018, the Husband commenced these proceedings on the basis that parties have lived apart for a continuous period of at least 4 years preceding the filing of the Writ, since 2009. Interim Judgment was obtained on 21 May 2018.

## Division of assets

### Just and equitable division of matrimonial assets

16     The Court of Appeal in _ANJ v ANK[^3]_ set out a structured approach (at \[17\]–\[30\]) to determine a just and equitable division of matrimonial assets. This approach may be summarised as follows (see _ANJ v ANK_ at \[22\]–\[26\], \[28\]; _Twiss, Christopher James Hans v Twiss, Yvonne Prendergast[^4]_ at \[17\]):

(a)     express as a ratio the parties’ direct contributions relative to each other, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets;

(b)     express as a second ratio the parties’ indirect contributions relative to each other, having regard to both financial and non-financial contributions; and

(c)     derive the parties’ overall contributions relative to each other by taking an average of the two ratios above (the derived ratio shall hereinafter be referred to as the “average ratio”), keeping in mind that, depending on the circumstances of each case, the direct and indirect contributions may not be accorded equal weight, and one of the two ratios may be accorded more significance than the other. Adjustments may also be made taking into consideration other relevant factors under ss 112 or 114(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“WC”).

### Pool of matrimonial assets

17     There is generally no dispute on the pool of matrimonial assets, save for two issues:-

a)     Whether the Husband’s liabilities should be taken into account in the pool of matrimonial assets; and

b)     What is the operative date for determining the pool of matrimonial assets?

##### Should the Husband’s liabilities be taken into account in the pool of matrimonial assets?

18     In his Affidavit of Assets and Means, the Husband declared his liabilities[^5] (apart from the housing loan):-

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="46.22%"> <col width="53.78%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">OCBC Cash Line</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$6,609.91</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">UOB Line of Credit</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$27,200</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DBS Credit cards</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$44,881.09</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

19     In relation to the OCBC Cash Line, he exhibited a document showing the balance as at 3 August 2018 being $6,609.91[^6]. In relation to his UOB Line of Credit, he only exhibited the agreement with UOB[^7]. He exhibited his DBS credit card statements for February to July 2018[^8].

20     In his Affidavit of Assets and Means, he gave the following explanation as to how these were incurred[^9]:-

a)     OCBC Cashline – his income was not sufficient to support the family needs.

b)     UOB Line of Credit – he had accrued a lot of debts as his income is not sufficient to support the family needs, and this line of credit was a consolidation of his previous debts with UOB.

c)     DBS Credit cards – his income was not sufficient to pay for the household and children’s expenses, as the Wife had not paid any maintenance. He therefore borrowed on his credit card statements to sustain his family’s expenses. There were recent transactions from Australia, Indonesia, China from his business trips but those were claimable. The debt mainly accrued from 2017 as the children had tuition and he bought tickets for them to go back to Indonesia.

21     The Wife’s response in her 2nd Affidavit, was simply a bare denial, and she added that if the Husband disregarded financial prudence and continue to live beyond his means, she should not be made to pay the price[^10].

22     The Wife had the benefit of perusing the documents exhibited by the Husband in his Affidavit of Assets and Means, but did not raise any questions in relation to the transactions in his credit card statements or the use of his credit facilities.

23     In fact, the Wife took out an application for discovery on 11 October 2018 and none of the items asked for related to the transactions that the Husband had charged to his credit card, or the use of the credit facilities.

24     Even in the Submissions, the Wife’s case is that if the Husband had incurred debts as a result of financial imprudence or mismanagement or living beyond his means, she should not be made to bear the burden[^11].

25     At the ancillary matter hearing, the Wife’s counsel picked on certain items in the Husband’s DBS credit card statements, and pointed out that there were transactions for hotels, gym, travel, jewellery, clothes and alleged that these were not for the children. These were never raised by the Wife before, and in fact, to raise it only at the hearing, it is not fair to the Husband who has not been given an opportunity to answer to these allegations.

26     The Wife’s counsel submitted that the Husband has the burden to show that the transactions were necessary and were indeed for the children. While it may be so, the fact is that the Wife should in the first place, raise an issue about these transactions so that the Husband would know that this is an issue that he has to meet.

27     The Husband exhibited his credit card statements, and in those statements, there are many transactions. If the Wife’s counsel’s submission is correct, this would have meant that every Affidavit of Assets filed by every party in divorce proceedings would run into hundreds or even thousands of pages because the party filing the affidavit would have to show each and every transaction was for the family. This is not the intent of the courts for parties to file thick voluminous affidavits. It would not only take a lot of effort and time to compile these affidavits, and it would also mean the parties would have to incur a lot of costs for legal fees and filing fees.

28     By just raising such an oral argument literally at the last moment and not giving the other party notice that such an argument would be raised, it is tantamount to litigation by surprise, which should not be the way matrimonial matters are litigated.

29     Perusing the credit card statements (from February to July 2018), there is no evidence before the Court as to how many of these transactions were for the Husband’s personal expenses, and how many were for the children and the household? There was only an allegation made only by the Wife’s counsel from the bar, not supported by the Wife’s own evidence and the Court is not in a position to examine the transactions when the Court does not have the benefit of an explanation from the Husband. Even if on the face of it, some of the transactions do not appear to be for the children, there are other transactions which the Wife’s counsel had not raised and which may be for the children, it would be unfair to disregard all the transactions entirely.

30     As at February 2018, there was an outstanding balance of $54,703.65 on the credit cards[^12]. There is no evidence before the Court how this balance came about. There is no evidence to show that part of this or all of this sum of $54,703.65 was incurred for the Husband’s own personal expenses.

31     At the hearing, the Wife’s counsel also raised the issue that some of the credit card transactions appear to be business expenses and that the Husband would have been reimbursed by his employers. If credit card bills were racked up by the Husband without him making any payment of the sums he had been reimbursed, it would be unfair to the Wife.

32     Again, this was an argument only raised orally by the Wife’s counsel at the hearing, and was not raised in her affidavits nor in her submissions.

33     The Husband in his Affidavit of Assets and Means, already declared that some of the transactions were business expenses and were claimable by him. There was no discovery or interrogatories requested by the Wife on how much he had received from his employers for these business expenses and/or whether he applied these monies to reducing the outstanding balance of the credit card liabilities. Even in her 2nd Affidavit, she did not raise the fact that the Husband would have received reimbursements from his employers.

34     Even if the Husband had received reimbursements and did not apply these monies to reducing his credit card liabilities, these reimbursements would have been received by the Husband into his bank accounts, and his bank accounts are already in the pool of matrimonial assets for division. So, the Wife would have the “benefit” of such payment.

35     In relation to the UOB and OCBC credit facilities, the Wife did not raise any issues with it, save for the fact that she should not bear the burden if it was the Husband who was financially imprudent. There is no evidence to show that the Husband used these for his own purposes instead of the family. Again, there was no discovery or interrogatories requested from the Wife in relation to the use of these credit facilities.

36     Therefore, I have taken into account the Husband’s liabilities when determining the pool of matrimonial assets.

##### What is the operative date for determining the pool of matrimonial assets?

37     The Court of Appeal in _ARX v. ARY[^13]_ held that:-

“while the court retains the discretion to select the appropriate operative date to determine the pool of matrimonial assets, there is much to be said that, unless the particular circumstances or justice of the case warrant it, the _starting point_ or _default position_ should be the date that interim judgment is granted.”

38     The Husband’s position is that the operative date for determining the pool of assets should be the date of separation (i.e. in February 2009). His case is that parties had been living apart for almost a decade and the Wife did not make any direct or indirect contributions towards the assets of the Husband which were acquired post separation and vice versa.

39     I did not see that as a good reason to depart from the default position of using the date of the interim judgement as the operative date to determine the pool of assets.

40     While the Husband made that argument in his submissions, he did not adduce any evidence as to which of his assets were acquired before and after separation. In fact, in the Affidavits of Assets and Means, both parties did not make such a distinction between pre and post separation assets.

41     The Wife was agreeable to use the date of the Interim Judgment as the operative date for determining the matrimonial assets. However, she took the curious position to only include the CPF accounts of the parties and the matrimonial property and to exclude the rest of the assets for division. The Husband did not agree with such cherry picking and his position was that if the date of the Interim Judgment was to be taken as the operative date, then all the assets and liabilities should be taken.

42     There were no precedents cited by the Wife’s counsel, where after making a determination of the pool of the matrimonial assets, the Court only divided one or two assets out of the entire pool. In any event, the Wife’s counsel conceded that the Wife had no issues if all the matrimonial assets were to be divided.

43     As such, since the Wife had no issues for all the matrimonial assets to be divided, I took into account the assets of the parties as at the date of the Interim Judgment.

##### Pool of matrimonial assets

44     Save for the Husband’s liabilities, the parties did not dispute the values to be used for the pool of matrimonial assets.

45     The pool of matrimonial assets was therefore as follows: -

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="61.1%"> <col width="38.9%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Value ($)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Matrimonial property<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$547,630.00</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Husband’s assets<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$160,336.64</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Wife’s assets<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$124,988.16</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><u>Less:</u></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Husband’s liabilities: -</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">OCBC Cash Line - $6,609.91</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">UOB Line of Credit - $27,200</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DBS Credit cards – $44,881.09</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$78,691.00</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">TOTAL</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$754,263.80</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

### Direct contributions of the parties

46     For the assets held in their own name, there was no allegation by either party that there had been contribution from their respective spouses.

47     The only asset in which both parties have alleged to have made direct contributions was the matrimonial property.

48     The Husband’s case is that he contributed 100% towards the acquisition of the matrimonial property. The Wife’s position is that she paid $34,600 (on 22 September and 22 November 2005).

49     The various cash payments made towards the purchase of the matrimonial property were as follows: -

a)     When the Offer to Purchase was signed on 21 September 2005, OCBC cheque no. 458925[^17] was issued for $3,950.

b)     The balance 4% of $15,800 was subsequently paid on 3 October 2005 through a cheque issued from the Husband’s OCBC Easicredit account[^18].

c)     $14,400 in cash was paid on 22 November 2005.

d)     Balance $1,083 was paid sometime after 29 November 2005.

#### Cheques for $3,950 and $15,800

50     The sum was $3,950 was paid via a OCBC Cheque No. 458925[^19]. It is clear that this cheque was issued from the Husband’s Easicredit account. This is because the cheques issued from his Easicredit account started with the numbers 4589xxx[^20].

51     The sum of $15,800 was also paid via a cheque issued from the Husband’s Easicredit account[^21]. The cheque number was 458931 and issued on 7 October 2005.

52     While it is clear that the cheques were issued from the Husband’s Easicredit account, the source of funds was disputed.

53     The Wife claimed that she provided the source of funds. In her Affidavit of Means, she said she remembered giving $25,000 to the Husband to pay for the cash deposit[^22]. She claimed that she had some funds then from a USD25,000 fixed deposit with DBS[^23]. She repeated her allegation of giving the Husband $25,000 in her 2nd Affidavit[^24]. In her 3rd Affidavit, after she had obtained her bank statements for the period between September to November 2005, she was able to state specifically that on 22 September 2005, she withdrew cash of $20,200 and she alleged that she gave this to the Husband[^25].

54     It therefore does appear that the Wife did have funds at that material time which would have been sufficient for her to contribute towards the purchase of the matrimonial property.

55     However, while she had shown that she withdrew the sum of $20,200, there is a lack of evidence as to whether this sum was used to make payment towards the matrimonial property.

56     The total down payment to be paid by the parties was $19,750. This was less than what the Wife had withdrawn from her bank account. Moreover, the first sum of $3,950 was to be paid on 21 September 2005 and the balance of $15,800 was to be paid on 7 October 2005. Even if she had transferred the funds from her fixed deposit to her DBS Account on 22 September 2005, there was no need for her to withdraw the entire sum of $20,200 on the same day. She could have withdrawn part of the money to first meet the payment of $3,950 and the balance closer to 7 October 2005.

57     The Husband’s evidence on his sole contributions towards the down payment of $3,950 and $15,800 is also not helpful. While the cheques were issued from his Easicredit account, there is no evidence that he had the source of funds to meet such payments.

58     Looking at his Easicredit account statements, on 3 October 2005, there was a funds transfer of $15,000 in order for him to have the funds to issue a cheque for $15,800[^26]. Prior to this deposit, his Easicredit account was in deficit. There is no evidence showing that the Husband had other bank accounts or assets which would have enabled him to make that funds transfer of $15,000.

59     The only evidence he had produced was his other bank account (DBS), in which there was less than $1,000 in October 2005[^27] and his UOB account. The UOB bank account (UOB) at the material time, did not appear to have sufficient funds because he had to transfer funds from his DBS account to ensure that the cheques issued from his UOB account would be cleared for payment[^28].

60     If the sum of $15,000 came from another of the Husband’s own accounts, there would not be a need for him to have a deficit in his Easicredit account in the first place, as he would have been easily able to clear that deficit.

61     As neither party’s evidence is conclusive in relation to who contributed to the payment of the down payment of $19,750, I have attributed it equally as both parties’ contributions.

#### Cash $14,400

62     The Husband’s case is that he went down to the law firm on 22 November 2005 to pay $14,400 in cash. In preparation for making such payment, he started making cash withdrawals from his DBS Account from 10 November to 22 November 2005, totalling $10,200[^29]. The balance $4,200 (for which there is no documentary evidence), he said he withdrew from various credit facilities at that time[^30].

63     The Husband produced his DBS bank statements to show the withdrawals he had allegedly made between 10 November 2005 to 22 November 2005[^31]. Based on documentary evidence, he could only account for withdrawals of $10,200.

64     While there may have been withdrawals of $10,200, there is no evidence that these monies were then used to pay to the law firm. The withdrawals could be for the Husband’s personal use, or for the family’s use.

65     The parties were supposed to have paid the monies to the law firm on 22 November 2005. The withdrawals by the Husband were made more than one week before 22 November 2005.

66     When the Wife claimed to have withdrawn $20,200 cash on 22 September 2005 to meet the payment on 7 October 2005, the Husband’s counsel submitted that “_\[it\] makes no sense for them to keep such large amount of cash at home from the date of withdrawal (22 September 2005) to the date of payment (7 October 2005)[^32]_”, a similar argument could be made in relation to the Husband withdrawing various amounts from 10 November 2005 to prepare for payment on 22 November 2005.

67     As for the balance $4,400 which the Husband was unable to account for, he said he withdrew from various credit facilities at the time[^33]. This was different from what he had earlier stated in his Affidavit of Assets and Means, where he had claimed that the $14,400 came from his sole bank account and there was no mention of him using any credit facilities[^34].

68     The Wife’s case is that she withdrew $14,400 from her DBS Savings account and gave this to the Husband, who told her that it was to be used for the payment of the matrimonial property[^35].

69     The Wife produced her DBS Bank statement to support her case that she had withdrawn $14,400 from her account[^36]. From the statement, it was reflected that on 22 November 2005, there was a withdrawal of $14,400. However, the Wife had on the same day deposited cash of $14,400. If this sum of $14,400 was to be paid to the lawyers on 22 November 2005, there would not have been a need to deposit the sum into the account only to be withdrawn on the same day. It would have made sense to have the cash paid straight to the lawyers.

70     As the evidence from neither party is conclusive, I have also attributed the sum of $14,400 equally as the parties’ contributions.

#### $1,083

71     For the balance $1,083, the Husband produced copies of his cheque book to show that he had issued a cheque for $1,083 to the law firm. He had transferred funds from his DBS to ensure that this cheque would be cleared for payment[^37].

72     I therefore accept that the Husband was the sole contributor towards this sum.

#### Monthly mortgage instalments

73     For the monthly instalments, there was no dispute that the Husband paid these through his CPF and that the Wife did not make any payment towards them.

74     As at November 2018, the Husband contributed $195,920.60 through his CPF account. I have only taken the principal sum into consideration, as the interest accrued was not withdrawn to make payment towards the mortgage.

#### Renovations

75     The Husband claimed to have spent $16,087.013 on renovations. The Wife did not dispute this[^38].

76     Therefore, the direct contributions of the respective parties were as follows:-

#### Other issues in relation to direct contributions

77     The Husband tried to increase the quantum of his direct contributions towards the matrimonial property by including the payments he had made towards the MCST fees and sinking funds ($50,092.32) and also property tax ($5,824)[^39].

78     In the Husband’s submissions, his counsel did not include the payments towards MCST fees and sinking funds and property tax as part of his direct contributions[^40].

79     Yet, in the Reply submissions, his counsel then submitted that the Husband’s payments of the MCST fees and sinking funds and property tax should be considered as his direct contributions and cited 3 cases which his Counsel says, were authorities to show that such payments were considered as direct financial contributions.

80     If the Husband’s case is that payment of MCST fees and sinking funds and property tax went towards his direct financial contributions, such arguments should have been made right at the outset in the Submissions filed in Court. It should not be raised only in his Reply Submissions. Moreover, looking at his case in totality, it would appear then that there had been a total contradiction in his case. This is because in his Submissions, he did not consider such payments as direct financial contributions and yet in his Reply, he or his Counsel ran a different case by including such payments as direct financial contributions.

81     Moreover, the cases cited by the Husband’s counsel were not of any assistance to this Court as the cases cited, did not make a holding or a finding that such payments were to be considered as direct financial contributions.

82     The Husband’s counsel relied on Paragraphs 13 and 14 of the case of _Pang Rosaline v Chan Kong Chin[^41]_. Unfortunately, those paragraphs are should be read in the context of the whole case.

83     The Court of Appeal in _Pang Rosaline_ found that the parties, for the better of their marriage, conceived a system in which it did not matter how or how much each party contributed to the family’s finances. Throughout the marriage, both parties’ salaries were deposited into the joint account, and bills were then paid from moneys withdrawn from the joint account. While payment of the mortgage and conservancy for a particular property was first deducted from the Husband’s salary before the rest of his salary was credited into the joint account, this did not detract from the fact that in essence, both income and liabilities were treated as an aggregate and integrated by both parties without distinction or regard as to who earned what and who was to pay for what items. Therefore, the Court of Appeal found that:

_“It was merely a matter of practicality and convenience that the husband, and not the wife, was to pay for the abovementioned mortgage instalments as well as the conservancy charges. That being the case, it cannot be gainsaid that the wife had made direct financial contributions to the payment of all property and services purchased by the parties, including the Neptune Court property, by contributing to the joint account. …. The husband himself inadvertently admitted … that the moneys in the joint account were used to pay for, inter alia, the property tax due on the Neptune Court property. Hence, on this count alone and (indeed) on the strength of the husband’s own testimony, there had been some direct financial contributions by the wife to the purchase of the Neptune Court property, viz the payment of property tax”._

84     Moreover, the case of _Pang Rosaline_ was decided before the Court of Appeal put forward the structured approach in _ANJ v. ANK[^42]_.

85     The Husband also relied on paragraph 5 of the case of _BLW v. BLR[^43]_.

86     The case of _BLW v. BLR_ did not hold that such payments were considered as direct financial contributions. From the facts of the case, it appears that parties did not dispute that the Wife had made direct contributions to the flat, amounting to 41%. Before the appellate judge, parties informed the court that there were calculation errors relating to payment of conservancy charges and property tax of the matrimonial flat. Parties came to an agreement on the direct contribution and the issue of whether payment of conservancy and property taxes are considered to be direct financial contributions was not even an issue for determination by the court.

87     Finally, the Husband relied on paragraph 52 of the case of _TBZ v. TCA[^44]_.

88     Unfortunately, it was an inaccurate reading of paragraph 52 of the case of _TBZ_.

89     The essence of the husband’s argument in _TBZ_ was that he paid 23% of a particular property. He submitted that he was entitled to half-share of the rental income of the property since it was an investment in both parties’ names. Part of the property was rented out to the Wife’s clinic, and the clinic had not paid any rent, so the husband submitted that he should be credited with a half-share of the notional rent that the clinic would have paid. The Husband paid property tax on the rental income received from the property. The Judge in the case, agreed with the husband and found that he had made 23% of the direct contribution of the property.

90     Nowhere in the judgement was it reflected how the Husband came to the figure of 23%, and whether his payments of the property tax were taken into account in this figure of 23%.

91     The Husband here, therefore, has not produced any authorities which would support his contention.

92     In any event, the first step of the “structured” approach required the court to have regard to the amount of financial contribution each party made “**_towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets”_****.**

93     Payment of MCST fees and sinking funds and/or property tax do not go towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial asset. These are incidental expenses.

94     MCST fees are collected so that the Managing Agent can pay for the day-to-day recurrent expenses of maintaining the development, for example, the cost of looking after the common property, payment of salaries of the security guards or gardeners or cleaners. The sinking fund is a fund collected for future capital needs, to cover for expenses such as painting of common property, replacing or repairing or making good common property. These are incidental expenses as a result of living in a strata titled development.

95     Property taxes are paid to the government, and is also an incidental expense as a result of being an owner of a property in Singapore.

96     As such payments are incidental expenses, they should be more accurately considered as indirect financial contributions rather than direct financial contributions.

97     If payment of such incidental expenses is to be included as one’s direct financial contributions, then it will open up to a whole array of other incidental expenses such as payment of utilities, repairs, fire insurance, cleaning, purchase of small tools or paint etc. This will then result in parties coming to court and filing thick affidavits containing such information as to who paid for a variety of such incidental expenses and how much these incidental expenses add up to over the years.

### Indirect contributions

98     Parties were married for about 15 years. Out of their 15 years of marriage, there appears to be three phases:

i.     The first phase lasted 6 years from 2003 to about 2009. During this phase, parties first stayed in a rented flat before purchasing a matrimonial property. They were childless for the first 1.5 years of their marriage. During this phase, the two children were born.

ii.     The second phase lasted for about a year from February 2009 to 2010. During this period, the Wife moved out of the matrimonial home and brought the two children with her to Jakarta. The Husband remained in Singapore.

iii.     The third phase started from 2010, when the children came back to Singapore to stay with the Husband and his mother. The Wife remained in Indonesia.

99     Financially, throughout the marriage, it appears that the Husband had been contributing more than the Wife.

100    When the parties were first married, the Wife was not working. The Husband therefore, had to pay for the family’s expenses. In 2004, when parties opened up a clothing business, the Wife then spent the income on the household expenses and also their family van[^45].

101    Both parties claimed to have paid for various family expenses. The Wife worked on and off, and alleged to have received financial assistance from her own parents. Based on her own evidence, she contributed about $1,500-2,000 per month during the first phase of their marriage[^46]. While she claims to have contributed such sums, the Wife has not produced any evidence to show her income or her means during these years, to support her allegation that she was able to contribute financially towards the family’s expenses.

102    After the parties purchased the matrimonial property, the Husband paid for the property related expenses for example the MCST fees and sinking funds and property tax. This was not disputed by the Wife in her 2nd Affidavit.

103    During the second phase, when the children were with her, the Wife paid for the children’s expenses[^47]. The Husband also contributed towards the children’s expenses[^48]. In the meantime, the Husband still continued to pay for the property related expenses.

104    During the third phase, when the children stayed in Singapore with the Husband, the Wife’s financial contributions towards the family was less than the Husband’s. In her own affidavit, she paid for a maid and the children’s expenses when the children returned to Indonesia during their school holidays[^49]. The Husband, on the other hand, would have to bear the rest of the children’s expenses and the family’s expenses.

105    Non-financially, it would appear that Husband has contributed more than the Wife towards the family. The children have been in the care of Husband longer than with the Wife. The Wife’s care of the children, especially in the 3rd phase of marriage, was only for short durations (during their school holidays when the children visited her).

106    In the case of _ANJ_, the Court of Appeal explained :-

_“No mathematical formula or analytical tool is capable of capturing or accommodating the diverse and myriad set of factual scenarios that may present themselves to court as to how the parties may have chosen to divide amount themselves duties and responsibilities in the domestic sphere. It is in making this determination that what is known as the broad brush approach would have to come into play. What values to give to the indirect contributions of the parties is necessarily a matter of impression and judgment of the court. …. What values to attribute to each spouse in relation to indirect contributions would be a matter of assessment for the court and in that regard broad strokes would have to be the order of the day. In seeking to arrive at a ratio that represents both parties’ comparative indirect contribution towards the family, the court must, in the final analysis, exercise sound discretion along with a keen emphasis on all the relevant facts of each case.”_

107    On a broadbrush approach, I therefore apportion the parties’ indirect contributions at 80-20 in the Husband’s favour.

108    Based on the approach in _ANJ_, I then considered the average two ratios to derive each party’s overall contributions to the family.

109    The average two ratios of the parties direct and indirect contributions was as follows:-

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="34.9%"> <col width="33.06%"> <col width="32.04%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Husband</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Wife</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Direct contributions</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">69%</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">31%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Indirect contributions</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">80%</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">20%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Average</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">74.5%</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">25.5%</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

110    After rounding up the percentages, I found that the assets should be divided 75% to the Husband and 25% to the Wife.

### Manner of distribution

111    Based on 75%:25% division, and based on a total net asset pool of $754,263.80, if each party is ordered to keep the assets in their sole names, this meant that the Husband would be entitled to $484,052.20 from the value of the matrimonial property and the Wife is entitled to $63,577.80 from the value of the matrimonial property. This works out to be 88% Plaintiff and 12% Defendant.

112    Therefore, I ordered that the Wife to transfer her share interest and title of the matrimonial property to the Husband, with the Husband paying her the sum equivalent to 12% of the net value of the matrimonial home. The transfer was to take place within 4 months from today. Parties were to obtain a joint valuation of the property. Costs of the valuation to be borne equally. In the meantime, from now until the transfer, the Husband was to be responsible for all the property related expenses, including the mortgage. The Husband was also to be responsible to pay for the costs and expenses of the transfer.

113    The 12% to be paid to the Wife was to be calculated based on the valuation less $262,370 (which was the outstanding loan as at 13 July 2018). This is because the Husband continued to pay for the mortgage instalments without any contributions from the Wife, and if the Wife’s 12% share was to be calculated based on the outstanding loan as at the date of the transfer, she would have benefited from the Husband’s continual payments in reducing the outstanding mortgage.

114    If the Husband did not wish to proceed with the transfer, then I ordered that the matrimonial property to be sold. He was to inform the Wife of his intention (whether to have it transferred to him or sold) within 1 month from my order. Then, the property is to be sold within 9 months. The sale proceeds, after payment of outstanding loan and expenses relating to the sale, was to be divided in the proportion 88% to the Husband and 12% to the Wife, and parties shall be responsible for their own CPF refunds. In the meantime, from now until the sale, the Husband was to be responsible for all the property related expenses, including the mortgage.

## Maintenance

### Maintenance for the Wife

115    As the Wife was not seeking maintenance, I therefore ordered that no maintenance is to be paid by the Husband to the Wife.

### Maintenance for the children

116    The Husband proposed that the Wife pays $1,920 per month for both children. The Wife proposed that the Husband maintains the children solely.

117    Section 68 of the Women’s Charter provides that it is the joint responsibility of the parents to maintain their child. Both parties are therefore responsible to contribute towards their children’s expenses.

118    The Wife therefore cannot ask that the Husband maintain the children solely. She needs to do her part.

119    Based on the parties’ income, their ratio is about 52% (Husband): 48% (Wife).

120    The Husband listed the children’s expenses at $1,414.98 for the elder girl and $1,362.48 for the younger boy[^50].

121    Some items do appear to be on the high side. For example, transportation $400 and $200 for the children respectively, and medical at $75 each.

122    Expenses such as holidays, birthday expenses should not be included because each parent can pay for these expenses for the children when they travel with them or when they purchase presents for the children.

123    The children’s reasonable expenses should not exceed $1600 (for the older child) and $1500 for the younger child.

124    Based on the parties’ income ratio, the Wife’s contribution towards the children’s maintenance should be about $1,450 (rounded down).

125    Looking at the Wife’s income, she should not have problems making payment of this sum. Her expenses can be cut down. For example, entertainment/leisure, household groceries expenses could be reduced. She has no liabilities and she has no dependents.

126    Therefore, I ordered that she pays the sum of $1,450 per month for the maintenance of the 2 children from 15 April 2019 and thereafter the 15th day of each month. This sum was to be deposited into the Husband’s designated bank account.
