Divorce

20 March 2019

### District Judge Nicole Loh:

1       The Husband and Wife were married in 1996 and have 3 children. In 2018, the Husband filed for divorce. On 29 January 2019, an interim judgment for divorce was granted based on the Husband’s claim. The Wife has appealed against this order.

## Husband’s Case

2       The Husband’s case was that the marriage had irretrievably broken down based on the fact that the Wife had behaved in a way that he cannot reasonably be expected to live with her.

3       He pleaded the following particulars:

a.     That parties quarrelled frequently largely over finances, which were provoked by the Wife;

b.     In early 2010, the Wife relieved herself from parental responsibilities and claimed it was better to live as a single than a married woman. The Husband had to take charge of all responsibilities of running the household and caring for the family;

c.     Since 2010, parties led separate lives under the same roof; and

d.     In 2014, the Wife stole the Husband’s handphone and intruded his privacy.

e.     The Husband had withdrawn an earlier divorce writ filed in 2015 based on separation to enter into a formal deed of separation with the Wife for a Writ to be filed 3 years later with the Wife’s consent. However, the Wife subsequently refused to give her consent. This was not disputed.

f.     The Wife then started to harass the Husband, despite their agreement to lead separate lives, by sleeping in the living room to monitor the Husband’s activities at home and found random excuses to enter his bedroom. She also started to stalk the Husband and incessantly called the Husband. She also called up his friends to check on his whereabouts or to tell them what he had told them was untrue after eavesdropping on his telephone conversations.

## Wife’s Defence

4       The Wife denied all of the Husband’s allegations although conceding a Deed of Separation was signed in 2015. She states that despite signing the Deed of Separation, parties never led separate lives. She admitted sleeping in the living room but that was to wait for their second son to return home. She is of the view that the Husband wants a divorce to be with his girlfriend and therefore made up all these allegations against her.

## Findings on the disputed particulars

#### Quarrels largely over finances

5       The Husband’s evidence on this was that the Wife had been in charge of the family’s expenses at the beginning of the marriage and he handed his earnings to her. They had frequent quarrels over what were reasonable expenses. Unknown to him, the Wife mismanaged their finances by living beyond their means, rolling over multiple debts from various banks and credit companies and this eventually led to them being declared as bankrupts.

6       The Wife denied that the financial debts were due to her mismanagement of finances. She denied frequent quarrels over finances although they had many discussions. The financial debts were a result of their wedding expenses, household expenses, investment losses and the Husband’s degree course.

7       I believed the Husband’s claim that the Wife was primarily in charge of the family’s finances prior to their voluntary bankruptcy application in 2003. On the stand, the Wife described their initial arrangement where the Husband placed his salary into a joint account which was meant for her to access to withdraw for household expenses. Her salary did not go into this joint account. She described her husband as a simple person and she will tell him how much she needed and he will tell her to withdraw or pass the money to her. This all changed in 2003 when they were declared bankrupts. The Wife’s claim that the debts were especially due to the Husband’s degree course was not supported by any corroborating evidence.

#### Separation that started in the year 2010 due to the Wife

8       The Husband alleged that in the year 2009, the Wife had declared to him, the children, family members and close friends that she wanted a divorce and refused to clean the house or do housework. She did not participate in the children’s affairs or family events including Chinese New Year. He accepted this state of affairs in the year 2010 and since then parties led separate lives. In 2015, when he contemplated filing for divorce, the Wife suddenly showed up at his parents’ home during Chinese New Year after years of absence. To allow her to accept their marriage was over, he withdrew his Writ for Divorce and entered into a Deed of Separation with her, with the intention of filing for divorce 3 years later with her consent.

9       The Wife denied that she made such a declaration or that parties led separate lives. On the stand, the Wife explained she made a statement in passing that she reminisced their carefree days before getting married as they did not have to talk about household expenses and she envied the couples in Europe who did not have to be married. She denied saying she wanted to divorce. She cited a tea ceremony of her cousin’s, which her Husband attended as evidence to show she never made such a declaration. She admitted signing a Deed of Separation but claimed they never led separate lives. To support this, she claimed that the Husband attended her birthday celebrations and she did have meals with him at coffeeshops. She also claimed that they continued to store their personal belongings together.

10     There was no direct evidence to prove the Wife did make such a declaration as alleged by the Husband. However, I believed the Husband’s allegation as the circumstantial evidence showed:

a.     The last holiday parties went on was in December 2009. Although the Wife explained that they did not go on holidays because they were bankrupts, it is not clear why this reason did not prevent them from going for their holiday in 2009. There were also no holidays after parties were discharged from bankruptcy;

b.     The Wife did not dispute that she had not joined the Husband’s family during Chinese New Year for years except for 2015. She claimed she could not attend because she was teaching tuition to non-Chinese students. I found this explanation rather weak as she could have attended the gatherings before or after her tuition lessons or she could have rescheduled the lessons if the Chinese New Year gatherings were important to her, as with most Chinese families. Furthermore, it is rather unbelievable that despite the different days of the week that Chinese New Year falls on in different years, she had tuition scheduled for non-Chinese students every year during the exact timings that the Husband’s family gathered but not during her own family’s gathering;

c.     The Wife attended the Husband’s family’s Chinese New Year gathering in 2015 which corroborated his account that he had wanted to file for divorce, which then prompted her to show up that very year. The Wife claimed that her sister-in-law had invited her to the reunion dinner to show that the family supported her if the Husband wanted a divorce and she asked her Husband what should she do. She also claimed she was asked to help her mother-in-law to cook as she injured her hand. The Wife’s very statement that she had to receive a personal invitation from her sister-in-law to the reunion dinner, if true, and that she had to ask her Husband what she should do, supports the Husband’s position that parties had been leading separate lives. If parties were living a normal married life all along, it would have been unnecessary for a special invitation from the Husband’s sister and for the Wife to have to check with the Husband before she joined his family;

d.     The Wife’s extensive evidence on messages exchanged between Husband and Wife for the years 2013 to 2018 showed communication mostly relating to the children. She claimed, rather conveniently, all communication between them as husband and wife were oral;

e.     The Husband and Wife had slept in different bedrooms since 2011;

f.     The Wife conceded they stopped having sexual intercourse since the filing of the previous divorce suit in March 2015. (The Husband claims it stopped since 2010);

g.     The Husband had installed an additional door to his bedroom;

h.     The drawer which contained their personal belongings was one which held their old documents such as old passbooks, school records which the Husband explained were just left there since they were mostly unused documents. As conceded by the Wife, they are their birth certificates, report books and jewellery. She admitted they have been there since she put them in and she never takes them out and she does not open this drawer unnecessarily. This did not go to prove her claim that parties did not lead separate lives.

i.     The Wife’s evidence about a tea ceremony which the Husband attended was in June 2009, before 2010 during which the Husband considered their separation to have begun. There was no evidence of the subsequent birthday dinners that they had allegedly shared. Her only evidence was a text message between her and her brother about her birthday dinner with no reference to her husband. There was no evidence that the Wife was involved in household chores (see para 16 below). Her own evidence on the stand was that the Husband had asked her to take up more work to pay for the children’s tuition fees and in return, _he_ then did more housework and picked up the children. A part time helper was employed around 2013 to help out as well.

j.     The Wife had signed the Deed of Separation on 19 August 2016 and was represented by the same lawyer throughout. There is no explanation as to why she signed this Deed. There was also no explanation why she confirmed in the Deed that separation had already started since 17 March 2015, more than 1 year earlier, if it was false. Within the Deed, there is also a clause that if there is a resumption of marital relations, either party has a duty to inform the other party or his/her solicitor in writing within 1 month from the resumption of the co-habitation, failing which the separation shall subsist. The Wife did not send any such notification.

11     With the above evidence, I conclude that parties were somewhat leading separate lives since 2010 although it was formalised in a Deed only in year 2016. There was evidence that Husband and Wife did attend some social functions together. The Husband explained this was because he did not want to reveal the true state of his marriage to his friends. This did not affect my finding because I was not considering whether parties lived separate and apart to satisfy section 95(3)(d) or (e) of the Women’s Charter as this is not the Husband’s case. I was only considering whether the Wife had made a declaration to withdraw from the marriage as alleged by the Husband. The Wife had denied this and had denied leading separate lives as a result. The above evidence of them leading mostly separate lives corroborates the Husband’s account of their marriage. Therefore, I make a finding that the Husband has proven this allegation in that the Wife had caused parties to start leading somewhat separate lives since 2010.

#### Harassment and invasion of privacy by the Wife

12     The Wife admitted to entering the Husband’s bedroom and attempting to take his handphone in 2017 on the stand. She claimed she wanted to check his handphone screen to see why he came home late. There was no further explanation on how a handphone’s locked screen will give her this information. Based on the police report which he filed a few days after the incident, he was at home and went to bed early as he was not feeling well. The Wife had crept into his room at 2:51am to attempt to take his handphone. These particulars were not rebutted by the Wife. Other than this failed attempt in 2017, the Wife provided photographs of the Husband’s messages with his friend as evidence that he has a girlfriend. This shows she did on another occasion, gained access to his handphone and went through his messages. The messages did reveal an exchange the Husband had with his friend that shows he had an interest in some other woman. However, they do not prove he has a girlfriend whom he wishes to marry. It must be stressed that the Wife’s behaviour in attempting to take the Husband’s handphone and/or viewing his messages was considered in light of the state of their relationship at that point in time. As set out earlier, they were already living largely separate lives and in fact, had entered into a formal agreement to lead separate lives.

13     The Wife admitted to calling up his friend (although she claims it is a common friend) to clarify untruths that he had told this friend after overhearing his telephone conversation.

14     The Wife admitted entering his bedroom, allegedly to put their daughter to bed and claimed she did not know it was out of bounds to her as this is her normal routine. However, the message sent by her then 15-year-old daughter does not support her claim that this is a usual routine of hers. In fact, it appears the daughter saw it fit to notify her father that her mother was going through his things.

15     The Wife admitted to sleeping in the living room although she claimed it is on account of waiting for their son and because of better Wi-Fi reception. I accept that there was no evidence to prove that she was monitoring the Husband’s movement by doing this.

16     The Wife admitted she took videos and photographs of the Husband secretly. These were photographs and videos of him dressing. Two of the photographs showed the Husband in the bathroom and she claims he was aware of the photographs being taken as she took them while standing beside him. This cannot be true as the first photograph was taken with his back facing the camera and the entire bathroom door was visible from the photograph, which shows she was outside of the bathroom while taking the photograph. The second photograph was taken from the back at his waist level. He would not have been able to see the camera/handphone to know she was taking a photograph. She claims that she took them to prove she had ironed his clothes (the household chores she did) and they did not lead separate lives. The photographs proved neither but demonstrated the insecurity that the Husband lived with in his own home with photographs and videos of him in vulnerable positions being taken behind his back.

17     There was no evidence of the Wife stalking the Husband or harassing him through messages. The call she admitted she made to his friend (paragraph 13 above) appears to be a one-off incident. However, I find on a whole that the Husband has proven the allegation of her invasion of his privacy from the evidence of her actions in entering his bedroom to try to gain access to his handphone without his consent, trying on his personal effects without his consent and taking photographs and videos of him behind his back.

## Has the marriage irretrievably broken down?

18     The case of Wong Siew Boey v Lee Boon Fatt is instructive in stating that the test to determine if the plaintiff has proven his case based on s 95(3)(b) of the Women’s Charter is a subjective one. The Court must decide whether based on the personality of the Husband in this case, it is reasonable to expect this particular husband to continue living with his wife.

19     The Wife’s defence in this case is that parties have not lived separately through these years and that they had no major disputes and that the Husband just wanted a divorce to be with his girlfriend. However, it does not explain why they stayed in separate bedrooms, why an additional door was added to the Husband’s bedroom, why parties signed a Deed of Separation, why she had to take photographs and videos of the Husband secretly. From the evidence that emerged, the Husband’s account of their marriage is corroborated. Despite the Wife’s numerous exhibits of their messages and photographs, the crucial evidence to prove her defence which she claims she has in possession (e.g earlier parts of a message chain, the video recording itself) was not produced. Pursuant to section 116 of the Evidence Act \[illustration (g)\], the Court can then presume that the evidence that is withheld by the Wife is unfavourable to her case.

20     Although I found that the Husband had proven the Wife caused financial difficulties which led to their bankruptcy, this did not amount to an irretrievable breakdown of their marriage. Based on the Husband’s own evidence on the stand, he accepted the fact that he had to go through and get out of bankruptcy. The children were very young then. He said he went through it and it is not very important to him. Between 2003 to 2006, he tried very hard to take good care of her as he knew she had depression. He also claimed that in 2010, when she wanted to be single and did not want to be involved with the family, he begged her and tried to save the marriage.

21     Therefore, although the financial difficulties caused by the debts and the bankruptcy status that both parties were in for a number of years were understandably difficult years, the Husband did continue to live with the Wife thereafter and did not consider the marriage to have broken down. Parties were still committed to their marriage.

22     The real tipping point was in 2010 when the Wife withdrew herself from his life to which he had no choice but to come to terms with. They then led somewhat separate lives since 2010. This came to a head in 2015 when he filed for divorce formally, only to be objected to by the Wife. He then withdrew it on the agreement that he would file for divorce based on separation in 3 years and the Wife would agree. However, the Wife reneged on this subsequently. This refusal to consent, by itself, would not be a cause for divorce to be granted as it is a right given to a spouse to object to a divorce based on 3 years’ of separation. He could file for divorce one year later, without the requirement of her consent. However, at the same time, he has been unable to live peacefully in his own home due to the strange acts of his Wife in trying to interfere in his life despite her agreement to lead separate lives. Despite putting up an additional door in his room, the Wife has managed to invade his personal space repeatedly. The photographs taken by her and exhibited in Court display a disturbing invasion of his privacy and modesty. I find that due to the cumulative effect of the Wife’s behaviour since 2010 to date, it would be unreasonable to expect the Husband in this case to continue to live with her.

23     Therefore, I find that the Husband has made out his case that the marriage has irretrievably broken. There has been no real or meaningful marital life between Husband and Wife for almost 9 years.

## Cost

24     I invited both counsel to submit on the issue of cost before reserving for decision. The Wife’s counsel claimed cost of $27,455.60 for work done and for disbursement. The Husband’s counsel claimed cost of $15,000. As I had granted the Husband’s case, cost will be awarded to the Husband. The Wife’s counsel originally claimed cost of $27,455.60 on the assumption that the Writ will be dismissed, and made no submission against the Husband’s submission on cost. I was of the view that both parties’ claim on cost was high for party and party basis. I considered the work done in a contested trial took one full day with one Affidavit of Evidence in Chief (“AEIC”) from each party. However, the Wife also succeeded in part on a preliminary issue of striking out parts of the Husband’s AEIC which I also took into account. I then awarded the Husband cost of $6,500.
