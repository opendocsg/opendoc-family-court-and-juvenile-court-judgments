Family law – Matrimonial assets – Division – maintenance - Family law

2 July 2019

### District Judge Jinny Tan:

## Introduction

1       The Plaintiff (Wife) and the Defendant (Husband) in these proceedings were married on xx May 1996. The Wife is 46 years old, and the Husband is 64 years old. There are two daughters to the marriage, one is 23 years old and the other is 19 years old.

2       On 26 September 2017, the Wife commenced these proceedings on the grounds that the Husband had behaved in such a manner that she was unable to continue living with him. The Husband initially contested the divorce, and filed a counterclaim, alleging that the marriage broke down due to the Wife’s unreasonable behaviour.

3       Parties were able to come to an agreement and the divorce proceeded on both parties’ claims. Interim Judgment was obtained on 14 February 2018.

4       The issues before me were the arrangements for the younger daughter, maintenance for both the Wife and the younger daughter, the division of assets and costs.

## Orders made

5       After hearing the parties’ submissions, and after considering all the evidence before me, I made the following orders:

a)     Both parties to have joint custody of their younger daughter.

b)     The Husband shall have care and control of their younger daughter, with the Wife having reasonable access. The Wife is to liaise with the child directly in relation to access.

c)     The Wife is to transfer her share, interest and title of the matrimonial flat to the Husband or his nominee within 3 months, upon payment of the sum of $85,480 to her. The Wife will then be responsible to refund her own CPF account of the monies used and the accrued interest. The costs of the transfer shall be borne by the Husband.

d)     Alternatively, if the Husband does not wish to take over the Wife’s share of the matrimonial flat, he shall inform her of his intention within one month. The matrimonial flat shall then be sold in the open market within 9 months and the sale proceeds, after deducting the outstanding loan, costs and expenses, shall be divided in the proportion of 29.5% to the Wife and 70.5% to the Husband, and each party shall make the necessary refunds into their respective CPF accounts of the monies used and the accrued interest.

e)     No maintenance is to be paid by the Husband to the Wife.

f)     The Wife is to pay the sum of $300 per month to the Husband, towards the maintenance of their younger daughter commencing 1 May 2019.

g)     The Registrar of the Family Justice Courts shall be authorised to execute, sign or indorse all necessary documents relating to the matters contained in this Order on behalf of either party should either party fail to do so within 7 days’ written request being made to the party to execute the said documents.

h)     Each party to bear their own legal costs.

i)     Liberty to apply.

## Appeal

6       The Wife has now appealed against part of my decision. Her appeal relates to my orders in relation to the division of the matrimonial flat, maintenance for herself and the younger daughter.

7       As the Wife is only appealing against part of my decision, I will give my reasons for the decision I made only in respect on those aspects which she has appealed against.

## Division of matrimonial assets

### Just and equitable division

8       The Court of Appeal set out the structured approach in _ANJ v ANK[^1]_ to work out a just and equitable division of matrimonial assets. This approach (with reference to _Twiss, Christopher James Hans v Twiss, Yvonne Prendergast[^2]_ and _ANJ v ANK_ ) may be summarised, as follows:

(a)     express as a ratio the parties’ direct contributions relative to each other, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets;

(b)     express as a second ratio the parties’ indirect contributions relative to each other, having regard to both financial and non-financial contributions; and

(c)     derive the parties’ overall contributions relative to each other by taking an average of the two ratios above (the derived ratio shall be referred to as “the average ratio”), keeping in mind that, depending on the circumstances of each case, the direct and indirect contributions may not be accorded equal weight, and one of the two ratios may be accorded more significance than the other. Adjustments could also be made in respect of other relevant factors under s 112 or 114(1) of the Charter.

### The matrimonial pool of assets

9       Both parties have agreed that the only asset to be divided is the matrimonial flat at Dover Crescent.

10     Both parties have confirmed that they are not making a claim on their respective spouse’s assets and those assets in their individual names are not to be divided.

11     The agreed value of the flat is $352,000. The outstanding loan as at 15 March 2019 is $62,245.

12     The matrimonial flat was purchased in 1996/1997 in the Husband’s own name, even though parties had been married then. The Wife’s was added as a co-owner only in 2006[^3].

### Direct Contributions of the parties

#### Parties’ CPF Contributions

13     The Wife contributed $12,323.19 through her CPF[^4] (as at 24 April 2018). As the Wife used her CPF monies to make payment towards the mortgage instalments until sometime in 2008[^5], the principal amount used from her CPF account remains at $12,323.19 as at today.

14     The Husband contributed $68,499 through his CPF[^6] (as at 2 May 2018).

15     The Wife alleged that out of the Husband’s contribution of $68,499, $50,000 came from a HDB grant given due to the proximity with his father’s home. The Husband does not deny that there was a grant given. The issue was whether the sum of $50,000 attributable to the Husband’s contribution solely or to parties equally.

16     I attributed the $50,000 equally between the parties as their respective contributions. This is because the matrimonial flat was purchased based on the fact that there was a family nucleus by virtue of the parties being married. The grant was therefore given to both parties (as a family) and not given to the Husband solely.

#### Downpayment - $30,000

17     There is no dispute that there was a sum of $30,000 downpayment made. However, there is a dispute as to the source of funds.

18     The Husband alleged that there was a loan from his sister to him[^7] to enable him to make the downpayment in 1996. The Husband’s sister filed an affidavit confirming that she had given him a loan of $30,000 for the downpayment[^8].

19     The Wife alleged that she gave the Husband $30,000. She claimed that she won $65,000 through a lottery, the lottery winnings helped to pay for this downpayment[^9].

20     In the Husband’s sister’s affidavit, while she claimed that she had given him a loan of $30,000, there was no mention of any agreed repayment term. Instead, according to her, the Husband could take his time with the repayment.

21     There is no corroborating evidence to show that the monies were used by the Husband towards the payment of the downpayment of the matrimonial flat.

22     In any event, even if there was a loan, and even if the Husband had used it for the downpayment, the Husband has not made any repayment to his sister[^10]. The loan from his sister should be treated in the same manner as a loan given by the banks to the parties for the purchase of the matrimonial flat. If payments had been made towards the reduction of the loan, such payments would be considered as direct contributions. However, since no payment has been made towards the reduction of the loan, the Husband cannot attribute the entire $30,000 loan as his contribution towards the purchase of the matrimonial flat.

23     There is no evidence that the Wife had won the lottery in 1997, save for her own bare assertions. There is also no evidence that she had given the sum of $30,000 to the Husband so that he was able to make payment towards the purchase.

24     If the downpayment did come from the Wife’s lottery winnings, it cannot be said to be attributable only to her contributions. This is because, if the parties had remained married, both parties would have shared in the windfall. It did not matter who won because that money would have gone to the entire family.

25     In the case of _LV v. LW[^11]_, District Judge Mr Khoo Oon Soo split the lottery winnings equally between the parties when considering the parties’ direct contributions. While the case went on appeal, the appellate judge did not disturb the findings of the District Judge.

26     After I had given my decision in this matter, there has been a case decided by the Court of Appeal in _BOI v. BOJ[^12]_ wherein the Court of Appeal found that in relation to the attribution of lottery winnings and with regard to contributions to the pool of matrimonial assets, there is a presumption that both spouses contribute equally to that pool:-

_“In so far as the issue of attribution of lottery winnings with regard to contributions to the pool of matrimonial assets is concerned, there is a presumption that both spouses contribute equally to that pool (for the reasons set out above)_ **_unless_** _the spouse who purchased the winning lottery ticket can show that he or she purchased that ticket with a view to only benefitting himself or herself and not with a view that the family as a whole should benefit from such winnings should they materialise”_

27     In any event, there is no dispute that the sum of $30,000 was indeed paid towards the downpayment in the purchase of the matrimonial flat. Since there is no concrete evidence by either party as to the source of funds, I attributed the sum of $30,000 equally as the parties’ contributions.

#### Renovation - $10,000

28     The Husband claims to have paid $10,000 towards renovations[^13].

29     The Wife’s rebuttal was that the parties did not do much renovations and most of the furniture were second hand/recycled ones provided by the Husband’s brother who was a contractor. She said that the Husband requested his friend to construct the kitchen cabinets, but she was not sure if he paid his friend or whether it cost $10,000[^14].

30     Nowhere in her affidavits did she allege that she paid for the renovations. Therefore, it is clear that the Wife did not contribute to the renovations. She was not privy to what was paid.

31     As the renovations took place many years ago, it is understandable if the Husband did not keep record of the payments made.

32     I therefore allocated $10,000 as the Husband’s sole contributions.

#### CASH CONTRIBUTIONS TOWARDS MORTGAGE

33     The Husband’s position is that the Wife did not make any cash contributions. The Wife, however, disagreed.

34     The Husband says that the Wife was a habitual gambler, and had incurred heavy debts due to her gambling addiction. She begged for money from the Husband and children and even stole money from their matrimonial property to pay off her debts. The Husband relied on documents to support his allegation that the Wife was not in a position to contribute financially[^15].

35     The Wife’s evidence in relation to her cash contributions has been inconsistent throughout the proceedings.

36     In her submissions, the Wife’s stated that she paid $38,500, in terms of cash from 2003 to 2013, and she also paid when he defaulted in the monthly payments[^16].

37     In the Wife’s Affidavit of Assets and Means, she claimed that she paid cash for instalments after 2008. Prior to 2008, she paid through her CPF money. She claimed that when the Husband made payments towards the instalments, she would then not make payment. She would only pay when he did not pay[^17]. However, at Paragraph 19 of the same affidavit, she only listed her direct financial contributions as the amounts withdrawn from her CPF Account[^18].

38     As can be seen, even within the Affidavit of Assets and Means, there is already a contradiction. In one paragraph, she alleged using cash and CPF, and yet in another paragraph, she only alleged using her CPF monies to pay for the matrimonial property.

39     There is also a contradiction between her Submissions and her Affidavit of Assets and Means. Nowhere in her Affidavit of Assets and Means did it state that she paid $38,500.

40     Moreover, her Affidavit of Assets and Means at paragraph 7f stated that she paid cash only after 2008. Even then, it did not appear to be a regular contribution. This is different from her Submissions where her position was that she paid cash from 2003 to 2013, and also whenever the Husband defaulted in the monthly payments, which seems to imply that it was a regular payment from 2003 to 2013 and on top of that, if the Husband defaults.

41     Her Reply Affidavit tells a different story. At Paragraph 12, she stated that from 2003 to 2013, because the Husband was away from the family, she was solely paying for the monthly instalments. If she was included as a co-lessee in 2007, this meant that she could not have used her CPF prior to 2007 and therefore she would have to make payment in cash from 2003 to 2007. However, then, this contradicts her Affidavit of Assets and Means where she said the cash payments were made after 2008.

42     All these inconsistencies show that the Wife’s contributions (as she alleged) cannot be believed.

43     The Husband’s position is that he made payment of $62,284.88 towards the mortgage instalments from 1 July 1997 to 31 December 2017. The Wife submits that the Husband’s contribution would not exceed $10,000.

44     The Wife’s case is that the Husband had not proven that he was gainfully employed before 2013. There was no evidence of his income. On the contrary, the Wife says that she had been gainfully employed over the years.

45     In the Husband’s Affidavit of Assets and Means, he stated that from 1996 to 2013, he made cash payments towards the instalments as he received his income in cash. From 2013, on top of his deductions from CPF, he would also make various payments of $500-900 in cash as his CPF contributions were not enough to pay for the monthly instalments.

46     In his 2nd Affidavit, he also repeated that the cash contributions came from him and his income.

47     The figure of $62,284.88, the Husband’s counsel explained that it was also not based on any documents, but rather on a rough calculation.

48     While the Wife’s case is that the Husband has not provided evidence of his income over the years, the fact is that the Wife is the one asserting that she contributed to the monthly instalment. The burden is on her to show proof. She cannot submit that since the Husband had not provided evidence of her income, therefore he is not to be believed.

49     All the Wife has done was to list her employment history over the years. Whether she used her income to make payment towards the mortgage, there is no evidence forthcoming from her.

50     Evidence from both parties on the parties’ respective income over the years and the payment by cash towards the mortgage instalments is scanty. However, what was clear from the evidence before the Court that the Wife was the one who had issues with her finances[^19]. She had sent messages to the Husband and their daughter, asking for assistance. Loansharks had also demanded for payment from her. The Wife herself admitted she borrowed money from her own daughter and friends[^20].

51     Therefore, I find that it is more credible that the cash payments towards the monthly instalments were made by the Husband and not the Wife.

52     As the figure given by the Husband is an estimate, I have adopted the figure of $60,000 (round down from his figures) as his direct financial contributions.

53     Therefore, the direct contributions of the parties towards the matrimonial property are as follows: -

### Indirect Contributions

54     Both parties in their respective affidavits listed their own indirect contributions, while downplaying the contributions of their spouse.

55     The Wife claims that the Husband was gambling a lot and was making his income from gambling and being a bookie shortly after they were married. She had stopped working, and was a full time home maker. She claimed she also helped out when the Husband invited his friends over for gambling. She looked after the two children. In 2004, she started working part-time and one year later she took on a full-time job. In 2008, she became a sole-proprietor of a cleaning business and subsequently she also included courier services into its business.

56     She claimed that the Husband left the matrimonial property in 2003 and came back in 2009 for a few months before leaving again. He then returned in 2013. After he returned, he had a job and the Wife claims that she then stopped making payments for all the outgoings of the matrimonial property. Only when the Husband did not have money to pay, she would then chip in. She moved out of the home in 2015. After she moved out, she claimed that the children would stay over with her on Friday nights until Sunday nights. One child stayed with her in June 2016 until March 2017 when they had a quarrel.

57     The Husband’s account of what happened during the marriage is very different from the Wife’s.

58     In his Affidavit of Assets and Means, he stated that he paid for all the family’s expenses, and his relatives and he had been the main caregivers of the children. He stated that the Wife was an irresponsible mother and wife, and had stopped returning to the home regularly since 2009 and stopped returning at all since 2014.

59     The Husband denies ever leaving the home, contrary to the Wife’s allegations.

60     From the affidavits, it is clear that the Husband made more financial contributions towards the family than the Wife.

61     For the early part of the marriage, the Wife was not working, and therefore, it would have been the Husband who had been the breadwinner. According to her, she only started working part time in 2004[^21]. Also according to her, after 2013, she stopped making payments for the outgoings when the Husband had a job[^22].

62     The Husband had also given some financial assistance to the Wife on occasions when she needed money. He exhibited the telephone messages which showed that the Wife borrowed money due to her gambling, and was not even able to make payment of her own rental[^23].

63     The Wife even resorted to borrowing money from her own daughter, as can be shown in the messages between them[^24].

64     Hence, the Husband’s financial indirect contributions towards the family is far greater than the Wife’s.

65     For the non-financial contributions, it is not disputed that after 2015, when the Wife left the home, the Husband had been the main caregiver for the children. Prior to 2015, while the Wife’s caregiving role is disputed by the Husband, the fact that the children did not want to stay with her when she moved out, shows that the children were not close to her.

66     When she moved out in 2015, she was staying in a terrace house with 4 bedrooms[^25]. This was large enough for the Wife to stay together with her two children. It also did not make sense for the Wife not to have brought the two children along, especially in light of the fact that she alleged that the Husband and/or his friend had behaved inappropriately in their daughters’ presence[^26].

67     In relation to the Wife’s allegation that the Husband had left the home in 2003, and only returned briefly in 2009 and later in 2013, he permanently returned home, there appears to be some inconsistences in the Wife’s story.

68     She stated that the Husband left the matrimonial home with a few of his things in 2003[^27].

69     Yet in another paragraph in the same affidavit, she stated that the Husband returned home, and sometimes stayed for a few days[^28]. In a subsequent paragraph, she stated that the Husband started to come home more often[^29]. If he had indeed left the matrimonial home, he would not be coming back to stay. There is therefore an inconsistency.

70     In her reply affidavit, she changed her tune and now stated that the Husband “was hardly at home” between 2003 and 2013[^30].

71     On the contrary, it appears that it was the Wife herself who was not returning to the home regularly since 2003. This is corroborated by their daughter, who stated in her affidavit, that in 2003, the Wife started staying out a lot, and the Husband remained in the matrimonial home and cared for them[^31].

72     It therefore does appear that the Husband has also contributed significantly in a non-financial indirect manner towards the family.

73     On a broadbrush approach, I am apportioning the parties’ indirect contributions at 30% (Wife) 70% (Husband).

### Division of the matrimonial assets

74     Using the structured approach as set out in _ANJ_, I found that the average of the direct and indirect contributions worked out to be 29.5% for the Wife and 70.5% to the Husband.

75     The Wife submitted that a higher weightage of 70% should be accorded to the parties’ indirect contributions[^32].

76     In relation to the different weightage to be given for direct and indirect contributions, the case of _UBM v. UBN_ is of some guidance.

77     In the case of _UBM_, it was a long marriage, stretching over 37 years and Judicial Commissioner Debbie Ong (as she then was), declined to give different weightage to the direct and indirect contributions. She held that:-

_“I observed that the consequence of according a 70% weightage to indirect contributions and a 30% weightage to direct contributions is that the Wife’s indirect contributions would be given pre-eminence as a factor in the division exercise. The direct and indirect contributions of the parties are already taken into account in steps 1 and 2 of the structured approach in reaching the average ratio. Having been accorded 65% as her indirect contributions, the Wife’s 65% ratio would be given an amplified consideration by a weightage of 70%. I declined to use the approach suggested by the wife for it must be borne in mind that the Court of Appeal has also said in ANJ v ANK (at \[26\] and \[28\]) that:_

_26_      _… We would underscore that s 112 of the WC does not give pre-eminence to any of the factors enumerated in s 112(2). … Put simply, the “average ratio” is a non-binding figure; it is meant to serve as an indicative guide to assist courts in deciding what would be a just and equitable apportionment having regard to the factual nuances of each case._

_…_

_28_      _… We are mindful that there remains a number of other factors under s 112, including the needs of the children; the presence of an agreement between the parties with respect to the ownership and division of matrimonial assets; period of rent-free occupation or other benefit enjoyed by one party in the matrimonial home to the exclusion of the other party; and the matters referred to in s 114(1) relating to a maintenance order for the wife. Insofar as the remaining factors become relevant for consideration in the appropriate case, the court is well-advised to make adjustments as it deems necessary to the principles stated in this judgment for the purposes of reaching a just and equitable result on the facts before it._

_Further, giving unequal weightage to direct and indirect contributions involves a measure of artificiality and may send the message that the court is constrained to adjust the ratio mathematically, when it is not so restricted; its discretion is, on the contrary, to be exercised in broad strokes.”_

78     The Wife submitted that different weightage be given for the direct and indirect contributions, and 70% weightage should be given on the indirect contributions. She submitted that there are 3 reasons for this Court to give a higher weightage to indirect contributions:-

a)     This is a long marriage of 22 years;

b)     The Wife had to shoulder the role of care-giver and breadwinner of the family;

c)     The Husband caused significant financial and emotional distress to the family.

79     I do not agree that the reasons are sufficient for this Court to give a different weightage to the direct and indirect contributions.

80     This is a relatively long marriage, and there are no good reasons why indirect contributions should be given a greater weightage than the direct contributions. For short marriages, a greater weightage may be given for the parties’ direct contributions because there would not have been significant indirect contributions made. However, there is no basis for the court to emphasise a party’s indirect contributions by giving a greater weightage to the indirect contributions in a long marriage.

81     Even if it is true that the Wife was the care-giver as well as the breadwinner and/or the Husband caused significant financial and emotional distress, the Court would have taken into account by awarding a percentage to her indirect contributions. There is no need for the Court to award a greater weightage to the indirect contributions. However, the facts in this case reflect that the Husband was the person who made significant contributions both directly and indirectly, towards the family and therefore, I had accorded him a bigger percentage to take into account his indirect contributions.

### Manner of Division

82     I therefore ordered that:-

a)     The Wife is to transfer her share, interest and title to the Husband or to Husband’s nominee within 3 months, upon payment of 29.5% of $289,755 (nett value). This amounts to $85,480 (rounded up). The Wife will then refund her own CPF account of the money used and the interest. The cost of the transfer shall be borne by the Husband.

b)     Alternatively, if he does not wish to take over her share, then, he shall inform her of his intention within 1 month. The property shall then be sold in the open market within 9 months from today, and the sale proceeds, after deducting the outstanding loan, costs and expenses, shall be divided 29.5% to the Wife and 70.5% to the Husband. Each party is to make the refunds into their respective CPF account(s).

## Maintenance for the Wife

83     Having made the order on the division of assets, I considered the Wife’s prayer for maintenance.

84     Based on the Wife’s own evidence, she is self-employed and does free lance work for courier companies. She is also a sub-contractor for a pet business[^33]. She also receives rental by sub-letting her place of residence[^34].

85     Therefore, it appears that the Wife is a capable person and is able to find ways to get income and maintain herself.

86     In any event, the Husband’s income is even lower than hers. He is a hawker stall assistant, earning $1,017.50 per month (take home salary)[^35]. On top of his own expenses, he is still paying for their daughters’ expenses without any contribution from the Wife[^36].

87     The Wife’s income as declared in her Affidavit of Assets and Means was $1,900 per month (for the year of assessment 2018)[^37].

88     Hence, I ordered that no maintenance is payable by the Husband to her.

## Maintenance for their younger daughter

89     Section 68 of the Women’s Charter provides that it is the joint responsibility of the parents to maintain their child. Both parties are therefore responsible to contribute towards their daughter’s expenses.

90     The Husband asked that the Wife pay a lumpsum maintenance of $28,250 being half the cost of both their daughters’ intended degree course and also $500 per month for 4 years.

91     As the older child is above 21 years old, she has to apply for maintenance in her own right. The Husband’s counsel clarified that the cost of their younger daughter’s intended degree course is $20,800.

92     Unfortunately, this is an event that has yet to happen. The Court cannot make an order for an event which has yet to happen because the costs may not be incurred. Maintenance can always be varied in future, so once the child goes to university, it can be subject of a variation application.

93     The Husband asked that the Wife pay a monthly maintenance of $500 per month for 2 years for the younger daughter. The Wife did not make any proposal on maintenance, but stated that she was willing to provide for their daughter, and their daughter was to liaise with her directly should she require financial help for her maintenance.

94     As stated above, the Wife’s income is higher than the Husband’s.

95     The Husband listed their daughter’s expenses at $700 per month[^38]. The list of expenses is rather bare, and appear reasonable.

96     Based on proportion of parties’ income, the Wife should be bearing about 60% of their daughter’s expenses. However, looking at her own expenses, her income is not sufficient to meet her own expenses.

97     Maintaining a child is the responsibility of both parents. While the Wife’s income appears to be insufficient, she should try to cut down her expenses or find an alternative source of income so that she can contribute towards the child’s expenses. Currently, she has not contributed to their daughter’s expenses, and everything falls upon the Husband financially. The Husband’s income is not very high and their elder daughter has to also try to contribute towards the household expenses. The Wife should try to alleviate the Husband’s and their elder daughter’s burden.

98     I therefore am ordering that she contributes a small amount, so that she can assist the Husband financially towards the child’s expenses.

99     I therefore ordered that she is to pay the sum of $300 per month towards the child’s maintenance commencing 1 May 2019.

## Conclusion

100    I ordered that each party is to bear their own costs. This was because they have a daughter who has deferred her education due to her depression and obsessive compulsive behaviour. Both parties should try to work together to see how they are able to help their daughter in this difficult time of her life. Both parties should not be spending money and time, and being acrimonious in these proceedings. They should focus on what is important in their lives – their children.
