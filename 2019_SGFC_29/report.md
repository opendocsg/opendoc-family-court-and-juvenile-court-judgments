Variation of Ancillary Order – Division of Matrimonial Assets

1 March 2019

### District Judge Goh Zhuo Neng:

## A.   INTRODUCTION

#### Original Order

1       Under the Order of Court dated 20 May 2016 (“**Order**”) which was made by consent, the Plaintiff ex-Husband (“**Plaintiff**”) was supposed to purchase the Defendant ex-Wife’s (“**Defendant**”) share of the matrimonial property (“**Property**”) within 6 months after the grant of the Certificate of Final Judgement (by 23 December 2016, as Final Judgement was extracted on 23 June 2016).

2       As consideration for the Defendant’s share of the Property, the Plaintiff would transfer to the Defendant (“**Plaintiff Acquisition**”):

a)     $75,000.00 in cash.

b)     A full refund of the Defendant’s monies utilised from her Central Provident Fund (“**CPF**”) Accounts towards the purchase of the Property with accrued interest. This included the $15,000.00 from the CPF Housing grant.

3       The Plaintiff would then take over the existing housing loan for the Property as owner and also bear all conveyancing, stamp, registration and administrative fees for the above transfer. There was no provision under the Order for the Property to be sold in the open market – or “**3rd Party Acquisition**” as defined in paragraph 4(b) below.

#### Orders Sought in the Present Application

4       In SUM 3297 of 2018 (the “**Application**”), which was filed by the Defendant on 17 December 2018, she was seeking a variation of the division of matrimonial assets under the following two scenarios:

a)     That the Defendant would acquire the Plaintiff’s share of the Property instead (“**Defendant Acquisition**”). This would be a transfer other than by way of sale with no CPF refunds made to the Plaintiff. At the hearing, the Defendant’s counsel said that she would be willing to transfer $60,000.00 to the Plaintiff and make a refund of his CPF monies utilised for the purchase of the Property, including accrued interest.

b)     That the Property would be sold in the open market with the net proceeds to be determined by the Court (“**3rd Party Acquisition**”). The order in which the proceeds of sale would be applied is as follows:

i)       The outstanding housing loan to the mortgagee bank together with interest.

ii)       The requisite CPF refunds in accordance with applicable CPF laws to the parties’ respective CPF accounts, including the housing grant.

iii)       The legal costs and expenses of the mortgagee bank and the CPF Board.

iv)       The management fees and sinking funds, and all legal costs and expenses of the Management Corporation in the lodgement of Management Corporation charge no. xx/xxx.

v)       The Property Tax outstanding on the Property.

vi)       All costs and expenses of the sale of the Property (including estate agents’ fees and conveyancing fees).

vii)       The legal costs of the Defendant on a full indemnity basis in respect of this application and all work carried out ancillary hereto or in consequence of the Application, including for any eviction proceedings to be taken against the Plaintiff and any occupiers of the Property.

viii)       The amounts paid by the Defendant in 2018 to the mortgagee bank on the housing loan.

ix)       The sum of $75,000 to the Defendant, and interest thereon at the rate of 5.44% per annum from the date of the Order (from 20 May 2016) till the date of full payment.

x)       The surplus (if any) to be paid as determined by the Court. It was only in her affidavit dated 29 October 2018, that the Defendant submitted that the remainder should go to the Plaintiff.

#### Orders Made in this Application

5       On 20 November 2018, I heard the Application, and made orders. These orders were clarified on 3 January 2019, for the Order be varied so that the Parties’ share in the Property would be disposed of as follows:

**Defendant Acquisition**

a)     The Plaintiff will transfer his share of the matrimonial property to the Defendant in return for the “**Consideration**”.

i)       Defendant refunds/transfers to the Plaintiff his CPF utilised for the purchase of the Property, together with any accrued interest.

ii)       Defendant transfers to the Plaintiff in cash, the sum of $73,763.76

b)     Following the transfer of the Consideration to the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff will vacate the Property within 1 month. The Defendant will also be solely responsible for the outstanding mortgage loan, property tax and outstanding maintenance and sinking fund contributions.

c)     Costs and expenses of the sale will be borne solely by the Plaintiff.

d)     The Registrar of the Family Court shall be empowered to sign the transfer form on behalf of the parties if neither of them do so within 7 days of written notice.

**3rd Party Acquisition**

a)     If the transfer of the Plaintiff’s share to the Defendant does not take place in 3 months from the date of this order, the Property shall be sold on the open market with the parties having joint conduct of the sale.

b)     In the event that the property is sold, whether by conduct of the parties or the forced sale of the mortgagee bank, the proceeds will be applied in the following order:

i)       Housing Loan and expenses that the mortgagee bank is entitled to deduct (if any) repaid.

ii)       CPF is refunded to parties with accrued interest (including the $15,000 Housing Grant to the Defendant).

iii)       Costs and expenses of the sale.

iv)       Management fees and sinking funds.

v)       Property tax

vi)       Amount that each party had contributed to the housing loan after 20 May 2016 will be returned to the parties.

vii)       Remainder divided 51.4 : 48.6 in favour of the Plaintiff.

6       Both parties were represented by counsel. On 4 December 2018, the Defendant filed a Notice of Appeal, appealing against all of my decision.

7       These are the detailed grounds of my decision.

## B.   THE LAW

8       The following principles on the variation of ancillary orders on division of assets can be extracted from the Court of Appeal decision of _AYM v AYL_ .

a)     The court does not have the power to revisit or re-open an order of court with respect to the division of matrimonial assets that has been completely implemented, except in the limited case of fraud. \[22\]

b)     However, if the order has not been fully effected or implemented, then the court would still be able to vary an order to divide matrimonial property. However, this would only be done if the order was unworkable or has become unworkable. E.g. if the order is impossible to implement \[25 to 29\]

9       In the case where the Court has not made a decision on who is to bear the expenses of the Property post the making of the ancillary matters order, the High Court in _TIG v TIH_ stated that :

a)     If there is a transfer to one party – Borne solely by the transferee who is the only person who benefits from the transfer \[18\].

b)     If it is a sale on the open market – Borne by the parties in the proportion to their shares in the matrimonial property, as both of them stand to benefit from the sale \[19\].

10     It should also be noted that in the case of _UKA v UKB_ , the High Court found that where an order for the distribution of sale proceeds of a property did not take into account refunds of the parties’ cash contributions to the housing loan, this lacuna could be filled in by ordering a refund of these cash contributions before an equal division between the parties. \[38 to 42, 51\]

## C.   WAS THE ORDER IMPOSSIBLE TO IMPLEMENT?

11     At the hearing, parties confirmed that the method of division of the Property under the Order was no longer possible to implement. The Plaintiff was no longer able to take over the Property as he was suffering from financial difficulty.

12     Therefore, this was an appropriate case for the Court to vary the existing Order in respect of the division of the Property.

## D.   HOW TO VARY THE ORDER?

#### Defendant’s Case

13     In support of her application, the Defendant explained that she had consented to the Order as she had been chased out of the property since 24 March 2016 (the Plaintiff agreed that she had left since 24 March 2016, but disagreed that she had been chased out). She never received the consideration of $75,000 or the refunds to her CPF monies under the Order, and the matter dragged on without any further progress.

14     In November 2017, the Defendant discovered that there were outstanding payments on the housing loan, which the Plaintiff was supposed to be responsible for. The Defendant repaid the outstanding payments on the housing loan and continued to service these payments up till July 2018. In March 2018, she also discovered that the Management Corporation of the Property had lodged a charge on the Property for the payment of outstanding maintenance and sinking fund contributions due. These payments remained outstanding.

15     Throughout this period, the parties continued to negotiate. However they were not able to reach an agreement.

16     It was also informed that by 17 October 2018, the mortgagee bank had issued a notice of intention to repossess the Property to parties, as the default on the housing loan had continued after the Defendant stopped making payments after July 2018.

17     In her application, the Defendant did not provide a justification of the consideration she should pay to the Plaintiff if there was going to be a Defendant Acquisition. In respect of the 3rd Party Acquisition, she was not able to provide an explanation as to why she would be entitled to receive the $75,000 she would have received under a Plaintiff Acquisition under the Order.

#### Plaintiff’s Case

18     The Plaintiff submitted that he should receive a cash consideration of $80,000 under a Defendant Acquisition, together with a full refund of his CPF monies. This was on the basis that he had made “_huge financial contributions_” towards the Property – for which he had no documentary proof. He did not have a position on how the sales proceeds should be divided in the event of a 3rd party Acquisition.

#### Methodology of Division

19     In determining the appropriate payments made by/to parties under a Defendant Acquisition and 3rd Party Acquisition of the Property, it was important for the Court to understand how parties had arrived at the original distribution under the Order which prescribed for a Plaintiff Acquisition of the Property. This basis could then be applied to determine the division of assets under the Defendant and 3rd Party Acquisition scenarios.

20     However, there was no evidence submitted by parties on how they arrived at the original distribution of assets for a Plaintiff Acquisition under the Order.

21     In this scenario, I then had to work backwards from the original distribution under the Plaintiff Acquisition to determine how each party’s share of the Property was valued, and then apply that valuation in the division of assets under the Defendant and 3rd Party Acquisition scenarios.

22     This was not an easy task as it was not possible to fully ascertain all the financial contributions made by the parties to the Property, aside from the CPF contributed by the parties and the Defendant’s payments on the housing loan after the Order was made. The parties did not even provide the Court with valuations of the Property in support of their submitted valuations for the Property.

23     First, I assumed the following facts under (a) below. Facts (b) to (f) were not disputed by the parties.

a)     That the matrimonial assets for division under the Order were the Property and the sum of $75,000 that the Plaintiff was to pay the Defendant for her share.

b)     That the net value of the Property was $216,934.21 (including the value of each party’s CPF refunds). This was the only value of the Property available to me, taking into account of the following:

a.       I adopted the average of parties’ valuations, and valued the Property at $625,000, (as the Defendant valued the property at $600,000 and the Plaintiff valued it at $650,000).

b.       Then I deducted the outstanding amount of the housing loan was $408,065.79 (as represented by the mortgagee bank on 4 October 2018).

c)     The Plaintiff’s CPF refund including accrued interest was $21,222.37.

d)     The Defendant’s CPF refund including accrued interest was $67,031.34.

e)     The Plaintiff’s contribution to the housing loan after the Order was made was $22,400.00.

f)     The Defendant’s contribution to the housing loan after the Order was made was $15,876.33.

g)     The outstanding maintenance and sinking fund contributions due to the Management Corporation of the Property as at 24 August 2018 were $16,591.96 ($4,663.47 as of and including 1 April 2016 which would cover the period where both parties still lived in the Property).

24     Second, I imputed these facts into a Plaintiff Acquisition under the Order. The distribution of the assets to each party amounting to $291,934.21 shows that the intention of the Order was that the Plaintiff receive 51.4% of the matrimonial assets for division and the Defendant receive 48.6% of the matrimonial assets for division.

#### Distribution under a Defendant Acquisition

25     Applying the above methodology to a Defendant Acquisition, the amount that the Plaintiff is to receive from the Defendant for the acquisition of the Plaintiff’s share of the Property should be a cash payment of $73,763.76, together with the refund of his CPF monies utilised for the Property (including accrued interest). I will explain below.

26     As set out in the table below, the Defendant would receive $53,680.50 more of the assets under the Defendant Acquisition scenario than she would under the Order.

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="33.1%"> <col width="32.64%"> <col width="34.26%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Plaintiff</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Defendant</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Property (excluding each party’s CPF)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$128,680.50</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Plaintiff’s CPF refund (which the Defendant has to refund to the Plaintiff)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$21,222.37</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Defendant’s CPF refund</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$67,031.34</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$75,000.00 cash (which the Plaintiff can keep and does not need to pay the Defendant)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$75,000.00</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$96,222.37</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$195,711.84 ($53,680.50 more than the $142,031.34 received under the Order)</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

27     In addition to the $53,680.50, as she is acquiring the Property, the Defendant will have to pay the Plaintiff an additional $20,083.26 (for a total of $73,763.76), which takes into account the following:

a)     The Defendant must repay the Plaintiff the sum of $22,400.00, being the amount that he had contributed to the housing loan (see paragraphs 9(a) and 23(e)).

b)     The Defendant will be entitled to deduct from the above, half of the maintenance fees incurred prior to the Order that still remained overdue (while the Defendant also resided there), being the sum of $2,316.74 (half of $4,633.47 – see paragraph 23(g)). While the High Court has taken the view that the party who acquires the property (in this case the Defendant) is to bear the expenses of the property that were incurred _after_ the ancillary matters order (see paragraphs 9(a)), I took the view that expenses incurred _prior_ to the order while both parties inhabited the property should be borne equally by them, as at that point, the division of the Property had not been determined and parties were living in the Property. So it was only fair for parties to share that liability equally.

#### Distribution under a 3rd Party Acquisition

28     Applying the above determinations to a 3rd Party Acquisition, the sales proceeds of the parties will be applied in payment of the housing loan, refund of CPF (including the $15,000.00 housing grant), costs and expenses of the sale, any outstanding management and sinking fund contributions, property tax, and the amount that each party had contributed to the housing loan after 20 May 2016 (see paragraph 10 above), and the remainder divided 51.4 :48.6 in favour of the Plaintiff (applying the share stated in paragraph 24 above).

29     I decided that the Defendant would be given 3 months from the date of this order to acquire the Plaintiff’s share of the Property. The Plaintiff would then be given 1 month to leave the property after the consideration directed in this Application had been repaid. The Defendant would then be responsible for the housing loan and outstanding maintenance and sinking fund fees and a registrar’s empowerment clause would apply in either party did not sign the documents within 7 days.

30     After the 3 month period for the completion of Defendant Acquisition had expired, the Property would be sold on the open market with parties having joint conduct of the sale.

## G.   CONCLUSION AND COSTS

31     For the foregoing reasons, I made all the above orders. On the issue of costs, I made no order as to costs as the Plaintiff had not succeeded completely, in her respective application.
