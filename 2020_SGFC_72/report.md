Family law – Personal Protection Order

27 August 2020

### District Judge Kathryn Thong:

## Introduction

1       The 49-year-old Father and 38-year-old Mother had each filed for a personal protection order (“PPO”) against each other. Both had also taken out PPO applications on behalf of their three children.

2       At the end of the hearing, I found that it would be necessary for the Father and Mother to have a PPO against each other. They clearly could not handle their interpersonal conflict without resorting to family violence.

3       As for the children, I found that the events complained of by the Father were unsubstantiated and some time ago. He conceded that if not for the Mother filing her PPO application in SS XXX/2019, he would not have done the same. Likewise, in relation to the Mother’s application, she did not produce any evidence that the Father would commit family violence on the children. She was in fact content for him to fetch the children to school and back everyday and hardly saw the children herself. This strongly suggested that she believed the children were safe with him. I thus dismissed her PPO application for the children.

4       Dissatisfied with my decision to issue a PPO against him in favour of the Mother, the Father has since filed this appeal, having been granted leave some 9 months after my decision, to file his notice of appeal out of time.

5       These grounds of decision thus concern my decision in relation to SS 613/2019 only, which is the Mother’s application for a PPO against the Father.

## The incident on 19 March 2019

6       Both parties’ PPO application against the other were filed based on an incident in the matrimonial home on 19 March 2019. Parties had an argument whilst their eldest son was eating breakfast. The Mother admitted to throwing a chopstick in the Father’s direction though it did not hit him.

7       In his police report filed on 26 March 2019, the Father stated that the Mother had thrown things at him during the argument and to stop her, he rose from his seat. Upon seeing this, the Mother kicked the Father. The kick landed on his left hand. He stated how he “immediately tried to control her. I tried to pin my wife onto the sofa and subsequently received scratches by my wife on my left arm.”

8       The Father’s account of pinning the Mother down onto the sofa was consistent with the Mother’s account in her police report filed on 20 March 2019, where she stated that: “..he pushed me against the sofa and pushed my neck into the sofa, and used his other hand to repeatedly hit the back of my neck. I struggled and he continued to grab my neck.”

9       In support of their account of being hurt by the other, the Father produced a medical report stating that he had a fracture of his left middle finger while the Mother produced photographs of her injuries, such as bruising on her knee and scratches on her hand. She also produced a medical report which noted some numbness and mild tenderness over the centre of her upper back; redness and abrasions over her right shoulder blade region and linear abrasions over the left dorsum of her hand.

10     At the hearing, the Father repeatedly acknowledged that he had “pinned” the Mother down on the sofa. He explained that she was screaming and shouting, and had refused to heed his requests to stop throwing things. Worried that she would eventually hit the LED television (“the TV”), he stood between her and the TV and she then kicked his hand.

11     The Father admitted that he then “grabbed” the Mother’s neck and pinned her down to the sofa. He described how the Mother was going “berserk” and how he had to keep pushing her down into the sofa as she was struggling to break free from him. When she tried to get up, he said he would push her down. He surmised that the bruises on her knees could have been because she was in a kneeling position whilst being pinned down. However he denied punching the Mother in the back, nor did he have any clue as to how the scratches on the Mother’s hand came about.

12     His evidence was that he had simply wanted to bring the Mother to his room, which he eventually did. He admitted that he may have also exerted some force as she refused to follow him to his room, and he had to hold her left hand from the back as he “guided” her towards the room. Once she was in, he closed the door and held the knob for awhile to prevent her from coming out. According to him, she was screaming away even as he left the room.

13     By the Father’s own evidence, it was readily apparent that family violence had been committed on the Mother. After the Mother had kicked him, the Father could have disengaged from the situation and walked away. Instead, he chose to pin her down to the sofa where she was forced into a kneeling position. This appeared to be a retaliatory response more than anything else.

14     But even if I were to accept that the act of pinning her down was reasonable insofar as it was to restrain her from potentially causing hurt, there was no reason for the Father to subsequently push her down continually as she struggled to get free.

## Conclusion

15     I ordered for parties to attend counselling to learn how to manage conflict rather than resorting to physical violence. As parties were continuing to reside together at the material time, and had minor children, they had to learn to co-exist without throwing chopsticks at each other, or pinning the other down.
