Family Law – Variation of access – s128 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353)

13 September 2019

### District Judge Cheryl Koh:

## A.    Introduction

1       Summons 1741/2017 is an application filed by defendant mother (the “**Mother**”) to vary access by the plaintiff father (the “**Father**”) to the one (1) child of the marriage (the “**Child**”) as set out in the Interim Judgment dated 1 August 2016. Summons 2951/2017 is the Father’s application for replacement and increased access to the Child. The Child is highly resistant towards seeing the Father, and has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD) by KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (“**KKH**”).

2       After various interventions by KKH, the Divorce Support Specialist Agency (“**DSSA**”), and through an Access Evaluation Report (“**AER**”) prepared by the Court’s Counselling and Psychological Services department (“**CAPS**”), the Mother sought for the Father’s access to the Child to be suspended until the Child completed his PTSD treatment at KKH. On the other hand, the Father was open to the Court’s recommendation for parties and the Child to undergo counselling and/or therapy with a private psychologist trained in family intervention and reunification work, who would then with input from KKH, supervise the Father’s access to the Child at an appropriate time. On 22 May 2019, I made the appointment as such. The Mother has appealed.

3       This case involves a consideration of a myriad of complex issues, including parental alienation or estrangement of a child against the access parent, and the subjugation of a child towards enmeshment and alignment with the care and control parent, following a divorce. Parental alienation is the psychological manipulation of a child into showing unwarranted fear or hostility towards the other parent. Parental estrangement is a refusal by a child to see a parent due to the parent’s negative behaviour. Enmeshment and alignment results from a child aligning his position with that of one parent, and mirroring that parent’s negative views and emotions against the other parent. The Court must be cognizant of these psychological pressures which may be unconsciously faced by a child following a divorce, and decisively intervene where necessary to prevent the further loss of a relationship between the estranged parent and the child, whilst always bearing in mind the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration.

4       The present case is one such instance where at least a certain degree of enmeshment and alignment exist between the Mother and the Child against the Father who has been estranged from the Child, and the Court has to intervene to alter the unhealthy _status quo_ for the long term benefit of the Child.

## B.    Background facts

5       Parties married on 18 September 2004. The Child is the only child of the marriage, and is now 13 years old and studying in Secondary One. On 19 November 2014, the Father filed for divorce. Interim Judgment was granted on 1 August 2016 on an uncontested basis with all ancillary matters agreed. Final Judgment was granted on 4 November 2016.

6       The Interim Judgment provided for joint custody of the Child with care and control to the Mother and access to the Father, including on Wednesdays 1.30PM to 7.30PM and Fridays 8.00PM to Saturdays 8.00PM (save that on the last weekend of each month, access shall be from Saturday 8.00PM to Sunday 8.00PM instead).

7       Nine (9) months later, on 25 May 2017, the Mother filed Summons 1741/2017 to vary the Father’s access in the Interim Judgment, as well as to appoint a Child Representative. The Father’s last access to the Child was on 24 May 2017. On 26 May 2017, the Father received the application. From 27 May 2017 onwards, the Father made various unsuccessful attempts to see the Child. On 4 July 2017, the Father filed an application for committal against the Mother. On 11 August 2017, the Mother obtained leave to adduce a letter from KKH Psychology dated 10 January 2017 as evidence, which reported that the Child had nightmares and fears of the Father. On 25 August 2017, the Father filed Summons 2951/2017 for replacement and increased access, as well as for the Court to call for an AER.

8       The three applications (the Mother’s variation application, the Father’s variation application and the Father’s committal application) were fixed for hearing before me on 21 September 2017. I ordered for a Child Representative to be appointed and called for an AER. Parties were also agreeable for the Father to have supervised access to the Child at the DSSA. I further granted the Father leave to withdraw his committal application. The DSSA supervised access was directed to proceed first, whilst the Child Representative and AER were put on hold pending the DSSA.

9       After considering a DSSA report dated 12 January 2018 (which reported that supervised access could not take place due to the Child’s resistance), I ordered on 27 February 2018 for KKH to furnish a report on the progress of the Child’s treatment to the Court, for parties to attend counselling at the DSSA, and for supervised access to be suspended pending the DSSA and KKH reports. Subsequent to a further DSSA report dated 25 May 2018 (which recommended for counselling to cease), I ordered on 18 June 2018 for intervention at the DSSA to terminate and for the AER to proceed. KKH furnished a medical report dated 7 September 2018 and after interviewing the Father, a second medical report dated 14 February 2019, confirming the prognosis of the Child as suffering from PTSD. The AER was completed on 30 November 2018, following which it was recommended that a private psychologist with expertise in family intervention and reunification work be appointed for parties and the Child to attend counselling and/or therapy, and thereafter, with input from KKH, to supervise the Father’s access at an appropriate time. I also conducted a child interview on 13 May 2019, in lieu of the Mother counsel’s request to proceed with the Child Representative.

10     The Mother’s arguments in these proceedings are as follows:-

> (a)     on 10 January 2016, the Father made the Child ride on a bicycle for a long period of time without stopping, causing abrasions on the Child’s inner thighs. Even after the abrasions healed, the Child continued to suffer pain. The Child was referred to KKH Psychology department in March 2016, followed by further sessions in May 2016, December 2016 and January 2017. KKH Psychology issued a letter dated 10 January 2017 reporting that the Child had fears and nightmares of the Father;

> (b)     following further treatment, KKH has diagnosed the Child with PTSD which is caused by the Father. The Father is not understanding of the Child’s feelings, did not respect his wishes in not wanting to see him and did not accept that he had caused the Child to suffer pain; and

> (c)     as such, the Father’s access to the Child should be suspended pending the completion of KKH’s treatment of the Child’s PTSD. The Mother is not keen on the appointment of a private psychologist to further assist parties, as unsuccessful interventions have already been made by the DSSA, and she wanted the Child to focus on the completion of his PTSD treatment.

11     The Father’s arguments in these proceedings are as follows:-

> (a)     there is parental alienation by the Mother and the Child is being influenced by the Mother not to see him;

> (b)     after the bicycle incident on 10 January 2016, his access to the Child continued with no issue for over one and a half years until May 2017. He had videos and photos of the Child enjoying his time with the Father. The Father had no idea that the Mother had brought the Child to see KKH Psychology during this period. If the Child indeed had PTSD which was caused by the Father, then why was the Father not consulted or involved in the treatment and how could the Father learn to change if he is not involved?

> (c)     he is agreeable to the appointment of a private psychologist to assist the family, as KKH is not able to involve him in the treatment of the Child, and KKH does not have the expertise in dealing with divorced families.

12     On 22 May 2019, after taking into account the reports from DSSA, KKH and CAPS, as well as parties’ affidavits and submissions, I made the following orders:

> _Paragraph 3b to z (including aa to cc) of the Order of Court dated 1 August 2016 be varied as follows:_

>> (_a_)     _Both parties and the child are to attend all necessary counselling and/or therapy sessions scheduled by \[XXX\] with a view to facilitating access between the Plaintiff and the child. Each party shall bear the costs of their own sessions with \[XXX\], and any sessions involving the child shall be shared equally;_

>> (_b_)     _The Plaintiff shall commence access to the child supervised by \[XXX\] as and when she deems appropriate and in the best interests of the child, taking such input from the relevant KKH doctor who is treating the child for PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) as may be necessary;_

>> (_c_)     _A report (which shall be kept confidential from parties) shall be prepared by \[XXX\] for the Court with regard to the various sessions held with parties and the child, in the event that a report is required for use in court proceedings. No court review is required in the meantime._

#### Parties’ affidavits and submissions

13     Parties have filed the following affidavits and submissions in Summons 1741/2017 and Summons 2951/2017:

> (a)     the Mother’s affidavit filed on 25 May 2017;

> (b)     the Mother’s affidavit filed on 24 July 2017;

> (c)     the Father’s affidavit (together with his family members’ affidavits) filed on 25 August 2017;

> (d)     the Mother’s affidavit filed on 12 September 2017;

> (e)     the Mother’s Skeletal Submissions filed on 20 September 2017;

> (f)     the Mother’s affidavit filed on 10 May 2019;

> (g)     the Father’s Submissions filed on 17 May 2019; and

> (h)     the Mother’s Submissions filed on 23 May 2019.

## C.    Grounds of Decision

14     Section 128 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353) provides that the court may vary an order for custody, or the care and control, of a child where it is satisfied that the order was based on any misrepresentation or mistake of fact or where there has been any material change in circumstances. It is trite that the “_golden thread_” that runs through proceedings affecting the interests of children is the welfare of the child as the paramount consideration: _BNS v BNT_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGCA 23</span> at \[19\]. In this regard, the Court is able to have regard to the wishes of the child where the child is of an age to express an independent opinion: section 125(2) of the Women’s Charter.

15     In the present case, both parties do not dispute that the access orders under the Interim Judgment dated 1 August 2016 should be varied. The Mother wants the Father’s access to be suspended pending the completion of the Child’s PTSD treatment, whilst the Father is open to the appointment of a private psychologist who has expertise in family intervention and reunification work. In my judgment, for the reasons that follow, it would be in the best interests of the Child for the private psychologist to be appointed. Whilst explaining these reasons, I bear in mind that the contents of the reports from DSSA (dated 27 February 2018 and 25 May 2018), KKH (dated 7 September 2018 and 14 February 2019) and AER (dated 30 November 2018), as well as the child interview on 13 May 2019, are confidential and have not been disclosed to parties. Hence, I shall refer to the contents therein only insofar as such information has already been revealed to both parties and/or the Child over the course of the various interventions by the doctors, counsellors and social workers.

16      _First_, I bear in mind that KKH itself acknowledged that PTSD treatment would require an indefinite amount of time to complete, and that in the meantime, parties and the Child would benefit from independent family work, which KKH would not be able to provide.

17     In terms of time required to complete the PTSD treatment, KKH acknowledged that despite intensive therapy sessions for the Child (33 sessions for about 2 years from March 2017 to February 2019) and despite the Child not seeing the Father throughout this time, the Child’s post-traumatic stress symptoms continue to remain elevated and require further treatment. It is not able to confirm the exact amount of time or sessions further treatment would take, although it estimates that up to a further 20 sessions could be required. As for KKH’s scope of work, it would be to work with only the Child in the treatment of the Child’s trauma symptoms. It has not involved, nor will it be involving, the Father or any third persons in the treatment. It also does not proclaim to have any expertise in dealing with family intervention and reunification work in the context of a divorce. This essentially meant that (a) KKH’s treatment of the Child could take up to a further 2 years and (a) KKH’s ongoing treatment would be solely focused on working with the Child without involving the Father. By the end of a further 2 years, the Father would have not received any therapeutic intervention for his relationship with the Child for 4 years since the loss of access in May 2017. Waiting indefinitely for the completion of the PTSD treatment before deciding on the next step would represent an irretrievable loss of time, and a further and potentially irreparable loss of relationship between the Father and the Child.

18     On the other hand, the appointment of a private psychologist to focus on family therapy with both parties and the Child would, in addition to and complementary with KKH’s treatment of the Child, provide a more holistic approach in this case. The private psychologist who has expertise in family intervention and reunification work would be able to provide counselling and therapy to the Father to help him gain insight and understanding as to on how to tailor his parenting approaches and modify his behaviours, with a view towards rebuilding a relationship with the Child. She could also assist the Mother to gain awareness and appreciation on how to refrain from any unconscious alienating behaviour and actively encourage the Child to meet with the Father. She would further be able to work with KKH and other third persons, and assess when it would be appropriate to attempt the Father’s supervised access to the Child. This would hence provide a more wholesome solution for parties and the Child and seek to address the multi-faceted considerations in this case, other than just PTSD. This would also mean that the family therapy work could happen in _concurrent with_, rather than _consecutive to_, the PTSD treatment, representing a savings of time for necessary interventions to be made before the Child may be ready again to see the Father.

19      _Second_, I take into account the limitations of the two KKH reports confirming the Child’s prognosis as suffering from PTSD. Whilst there is no reason to doubt the independence and professionalism of KKH, KKH itself confirmed that its prognosis is based on self-reporting by the Child, and there is no independent verification of the Child’s reported symptoms or information with the Child’s school or third persons (such as the maternal grandmother as a caregiver), as the Child did not want KKH to do so. In fact, the Child was a highly functioning child who had scored 264 marks for PSLE in 2018 and who had gained entry into one of the top secondary schools in 2019. The AER shows that the Child’s then primary school had no concerns about any behaviour dysregulation or poor functioning by the Child, nor did it mention any medical condition, chronic pain or arrangements put in place to support the Child. The Child enjoyed good relationships with his peers and was active in class participation and activities. The Child’s symptoms therefore do not appear to have affected his performance in school. Moving forward, KKH will also not be involving the Child’s school, other caregivers or family members in its treatment of the Child. The appointment of a private psychologist who is trained in family therapy and who is able to verify and receive information from the Child’s school, caregivers and family members, and work in tandem with KKH, would provide a much more wholesome and holistic approach to this case, than merely focusing on PTSD.

20      _Third_, I consider that the AER confirms the Father’s willingness and capacity for change. The Father’s attitude shifted considerably from the start of the proceedings in September 2017 where he was initially insistent on his access rights and the committal application, blaming the Mother for parental alienation and for taking the Child to KKH without consulting him, to a posture now where he expressed grief and helplessness at the loss of his relationship with the Child, and an openness towards any form of assistance and intervention towards reunification and reconciliation with the Child. In particular, at a session on 11 October 2018 facilitated by CAPS for the AER, the Child wrote messages to the Father expressing that he did not wish to see the Father and that there was nothing the Father could do to make things right again. The Father replied to the Child that he loved the Child very much, he was not angry with the Child, he was sorry that the bicycle incident had caused the Child pain and anguish, and asked the Child for forgiveness.

21     The Father cried and expressed grief over the realization that he had lost his son. He was able to acknowledge that the more he forced the issue of contact with the Child, it may push the Child further away from him. He demonstrated an openheartedness to try any form of intercession towards reunifying him and the Child. In my view, family work would greatly assist the Father to gain better insight into his actions and identify any weaknesses which could have led to the build-up of the Child’s resistance against him, and equip him with awareness and knowledge as to how to tailor his parenting approaches, and manage his communication with and behaviours towards the Child, so as to rebuild his relationship with the Child. Leaving the Child to be treated for PTSD alone without involving the Father would not address the Father’s capacity for change and would instead leave him ill-equipped and incapacitated to attempt reunification with the Child.

22      _Fourth_, I bear in mind that the reports from KKH, DSSA and AER point to a level of emotional dysregulation by the Mother over her negative perceptions and distressed emotions towards the Father arising from the divorce, which may have unwittingly exacerbated or reinforced the Child’s fearful and hostile attitudes and behaviours against the Father. There appears to be some level of enmeshment and alignment between the Mother and the Child, where both echoed the same anguishes and apprehensions against the Father, mirrored each other’s negative emotions and anxious actions, and experienced the same physical stresses and symptoms such as stiffness, numbness and pins and needles, when speaking of the Father. Disconcertingly, there are concerns expressed about the development of the Child as he reaches his adolescence, as to whether he would be able to individuate and differentiate himself from the Mother, given the level of enmeshment and alignment. In my view, the appointment of a private psychologist for family therapy would assist the Mother to gain insight into any unconscious polarizing behaviour on her part which may have compounded the Child’s anxieties, move away from any unhealthy levels of co-dependence between her and the Child and equip her on how to actively encourage the Child towards reconciliation with the Father. Having PTSD treatment as the only form of intervention would ignore the underlying relational dynamics and any psychological pressures faced by the Mother and the Child arising from the divorce.

23      _Fifth_, whilst I am able to take into account the Child’s emphatic wishes that he did not wish to see the Father, his wishes cannot be determinative of the Court’s decision on access. The Child is an extremely intelligent, expressive and eloquent boy. During my interview with him on 13 May 2019, he asked me to just _listen_. He said no adults have listened to him when he expressed that he did not wish to see the Father, but he hoped that I would be the one adult who would. In this regard, I would like to assure the Child that I did listen and in fact weighed his views with grave solemnity. I however had to arrive at a decision that is, although contrary to his wishes, made with only his long term best interests at heart. In return, I ask that the Child to just _try_: not try to see the Father whom he does not want to see, but try to see the appointed psychologist who would focus on family work with both parties and the Child. The psychologist would be able to help the Child gain understanding on issues that have arisen with the life change of his parents’ divorce, and identify goals and strategies for the Child to manage his emotions during the transition. It would take time for the appointed psychologist to build a therapeutic relationship of trust with the Child, but I have confidence in the Child’s intelligence, adaptability and maturity to be able to open up to another adult.

24      _Sixth_, it is not a situation where the Court has left it to parties to search on their own for a psychologist who would have the expertise and experience in engaging in family therapy in the context of divorcing families. Instead, the Court suggested that one could be chosen from a list of various private psychologists, as these psychologists have worked on family cases in the court system where access has been lost between the access parent and the child, and hence would be suitable and equipped to handle this case of a similar nature. The private psychologist appointed in this case happened to be one from the list of psychologists who confirmed her availability and willingness to CAPS to take up the appointment. This is in contrast to KKH, who has confirmed that it would not able to administer family therapy. Once the appointment is communicated to the private psychologist, parties can work with the psychologist and the Court on the drafting of the full and exact terms of reference. No review is required to be fixed for this case in the meantime, as this case has been reviewed since September 2017 and the appointed psychologist would take time to build a relationship with parties and the Child. Any necessary application may be made at a later stage.

25      _Finally_, I also consider that the Father has been having weekly access to the Child since parties physically separated in 2012. The Father has exhibited countless photographs in his affidavit filed on 25 August 2017 to illustrate the close and loving relationship he had shared with his son. The Father’s weekly access to the Child was incorporated as part of a consent order reflected in the Interim Judgment dated 1 August 2016. This was some seven (7) months after the bicycle incident in January 2016, which meant that the bicycle incident was not a new circumstance which should ordinarily justify the unravelling of the access orders agreed to. The Mother also applied to vary access just a mere nine (9) months after the access orders were made. The Court should give weight to the sanctity of the access orders agreed to and find a solution to restore access between the Father and the child. If left to wait until the Child is fully treated and ready for access, the relationship with the Father may by then have become fully irreparable.

## D.    Conclusion

26     The benefits of a holistic and targeted family intervention plan in the context of a divorce cannot be underestimated. It would help parties and the Child cope with the major life change of a divorce, identify underlying family dynamics and psychological issues arising from the relational breakdowns, and equip parties with set goals and useful strategies for coping with the transition. During my interview with the Child, the Child clutched his soft toys. These soft toys were apparently bought by the Father for the Child when he was young. It is hoped that with the holistic family therapy that is provided by the appointed psychologist for parties and the Child, the relationship between the Father and the Child may someday be restored to a place greater than it was ever before.
