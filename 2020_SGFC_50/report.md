Division of Matrimonial Property

29 May 2020

### District Judge Goh Zhuo Neng:

## A.   INTRODUCTION

1       This was an ancillary matters hearing. The Plaintiff ex-wife and Defendant ex-husband were represented by counsel. After hearing parties and considering their submissions, I ordered that there be no maintenance for the Plaintiff, and made orders on the division of matrimonial property which are broadly set out below.

> a)     That the matrimonial property at (address redacted) (“matrimonial home”) be sold in the open market within 6 (six) months from the date of the Final Judgment and the sale proceeds after deducting the costs and expenses of the sale, are to be divided 68% to the Plaintiff and 32% to the Defendant. The Defendant will continue bearing all expenses and fees relating to the matrimonial home pending its sale.

> b)     Parties will retain all other assets held in their name.

2       On 3 March 2020, the Defendant filed his Notice of Appeal against my orders. The Plaintiff has not appealed against my decision not to grant her maintenance. Therefore, I set out below my order on the division of matrimonial property.

## B.   BACKGROUND

3       The parties were married on 15 August 1975. Interim Judgement was made on 25 March 2019 on the grounds of 4 years separation since 23 October 2013 making it a marriage of 44 years. Even where the separation was taken into account, by 2013 the parties had lived together as man and wife for 38 years, raising 3 children who had all attained the age of majority at the time of the hearing.

4       It was acknowledged by both sides that this was a marriage whether the Defendant was a sole breadwinner, and the Plaintiff, a housewife. Disputes were raised about the Plaintiff’s role in bringing up the children, but I will address them later in this judgement.

5       Since the parties separated, the Defendant was living in the matrimonial home with one of the children, and the Plaintiff was living in rental accommodation of her own with one of the children. The eldest child had now moved into a home of his own. The Mother was currently working odd-jobs, and the Father was working as an ad-hoc teacher with the Ministry of Education.

## C.   VALUE OF MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY

6       The assets of the parties and my valuation of these assets are set out in **Annex A**. They were valued at a total of $422,810.52. The valuation of the assets and their inclusion into the pool of matrimonial assets were generally agreed, save for the following assets.

> a)     The value of the matrimonial home. The Plaintiff tendered a copy of recent sale transactions. The highest price and most recent valuation here was $290,000.00 for a unit on a lower level (1st to 3rd floor) on March 2019. The only other valuation was $288,000.00 for a unit on a higher level (10th to 12th floor) on September 2018. The Defendant submitted a value of $270,000.00, but conceded that he did not have any documents in evidence to support this. I adopted the latest valuation of $290,000.00.

> b)     Withdrawals from the Defendant’s Central Provident Fund (“**CPF**”) Retirement Account. On 27 March 2019, the Defendant withdrew $2,645.78 from his CPF Retirement Account. This took place three months after the writ of summons had been filed on 16 July 2019. He explained in an affidavit filed in response to interrogatories that he had done so to supplement his household expenses and for his son’s education expenses. No proof of these alleged education expenses were provided. It also bears noting that in his Affidavit of Assets of Means, the Father declared a monthly take home income of $4,769.08 which exceeded his stated personal expenses ($1,967.00) and his dependant son’s expenses ($1,265.00). I treated the withdrawal of $2,645.78 as a dissipation of matrimonial assets and added them back to the pool.

## D.   DIVISION OF MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY

#### I.    The Manner of Division

7       There was an issue as to whether I should apply the structured approach in _ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span> (“**ANJ**”):

> a)     Step 1 - Express as a ratio the parties’ direct contributions relative to each other, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets.

> b)     Step 2 - Express as a second ratio the parties’ indirect contributions relative to each other, having regard to both financial and non-financial contributions.

> c)     Step 3 - Derive the parties’ overall contributions relative to each other by taking an average of the two ratios above (the derived ratio shall be referred to as “the average ratio”). Weightage could be given to the different ratios depending on the facts.

8       The Plaintiff’s counsel submitted that structured approach in _ANJ_ should not applied and that I should order an equal division of matrimonial assets. Reference was made to the decision of the Court of Appeal in _TNL v TNK_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 15</span> (“**TNL**”) that in a long single-income marriage like the present where one spouse was a breadwinner and other the homemaker, the structured approach in _ANJ_ should not be applied \[_TNL_, 41 to 45\]. An equal division of matrimonial assets should be adopted in such cases \[_TNL_, 47 to 51\]. This position was taken after considering single income marriages of 28 and 30 years long – far shorter than the present case.

9       The Defendant’s counsel disagreed with the Plaintiff’s characterisation of the parties’ roles. It was submitted that the Defendant had also acted as a homemaker, as he had attended to all the needs of the children, and took care of the children’s educational needs. This was evident from his strong relationship with two of them. The Plaintiff had not been a good spouse as she had refused to cook for him some time before she left the matrimonial home.

10     When asked how he proposed to apply the structured approach in _ANJ_ to the facts, the Defendant’s counsel was not able to assist the Court. He informed the Court that he was instructed to ask that each party retain the assets held in their own names. No legal analysis was provided for his view.

11     I did not accept the Defendant’s submissions. It was not possible for him to deny that this was a single income marriage with the Plaintiff fulfilling the role of homemaker, and Defendant fulfilling the role of breadwinner. The parties did not have a maid, the Defendant was working full time as a teacher, and the Plaintiff did not work. It was quite inconceivable that the Defendant could have single-handedly juggled all the responsibilities of homemaker and breadwinner.

12     Therefore I accepted the Plaintiff’s submission that the structured approach in _ANJ_ would not be applied, and the matrimonial assets be divided equally.

#### II.   Orders on the Division of Matrimonial Property

13     Applying an equal division of the matrimonial assets of $422,810.52, each party would be entitled to the sum of $211,405.26.

14     It was not possible to transfer the matrimonial home to either party, as the value of the home ($290,000.00) was greater than either of their shares of the matrimonial assets ($211,405.26). Neither of them had sufficient assets to purchase the other party’s share of the matrimonial home.

15     Therefore, I ordered that the matrimonial home be sold in the open market within 6 months of the final judgement. These proceeds would then be distributed to the parties to address the disparity between the value of matrimonial property held by the Defendant ($118,555.80) and the Plaintiff ($14,254.72) in their own names.

16     The entitlement of each party to the sale proceeds would be based on the amount required to make up their half share of the matrimonial assets. This amount would be assessed as a percentage of the value of the matrimonial home to arrive at their share of the proceeds. Applying this methodology, I decided that after paying off the costs and expenses of the sale, the proceeds would be divided 68:32 in the Plaintiff’s favour. This took into account the division of assets to the Plaintiff on the following basis.

17     As the Defendant was currently staying in the matrimonial home, I felt it was only fair that he bear the cost of the expenses accruing from the matrimonial home pending the sale.

## E.   CONCLUSION

18     For the reasons set out above, I made the above orders on the division on matrimonial property.
