Family Law – Child Maintenance – Variation – Consent Order – Self-inducement

17 September 2019

### District Judge Azmin Jailani:

## Introduction

1       SUM 3610/2018 (“SUM 3610”) was an application by the defendant-wife against the plaintiff-husband to vary a maintenance order for the two children of the marriage, \[K1\] and \[K2\]. Both children are girls, with the elder child \[K1\] born on November 2004, and the younger child \[K2\] born on June 2007.

2       Specifically, the defendant sought variations on three areas – (1) an increase in fixed monthly maintenance from $3,000 to $6,522; (2) the removal of a provision dealing with the reimbursement / apportionment of certain “ad-hoc expenses”; and (3) separate provision for the children’s “major medical and dental expenses (including but not limited to braces not covered by the plaintiff’s employer’s medical insurance policy)” to be borne by parties in proportion of their respective income.

3       Parties’ counsels appeared before me on 22 March 2019 and 12 April 2019 to present their arguments. After considering the matter, I gave my decision on 10 May 2019 and provided brief reasons for the same. The entirety of my orders may be found in Annex A of this judgment below.

4       In broad terms:

> (a)     I only allowed a moderate and what I considered a reasonable increase in fixed monthly maintenance from $3,000 to $4,700;

> (b)     I substantively dismissed the defendant’s prayer for the complete removal of the reimbursement clause, save that I removed a few items stated therein. I also made a minor adjustment to the proportion of parties’ respective contributions, and made clearer how the mechanism of reimbursement would operate; and

> (c)     I made no order for there to be a separate clause dealing with “major medical and dental expenses”.

5       Dissatisfied, the plaintiff filed HCF/DCA 60/2019 (“DCA 60”) appealing, curiously in my view, the _entirety_ of my orders.

6       Against that backdrop, I now provide the full grounds of my decision.

## Background

### Parties and the terms of the consent order for the children’s maintenance

9       Briefly, parties were married in November 2002 in Singapore. As I mentioned earlier, \[K1\] was born on November 2004, whilst \[K2\] was born on June 2007.

10     The plaintiff commenced divorce proceedings in October 2012. Interim judgment was granted in April 2013. In terms of the ancillary matters, the issue of the children’s maintenance was resolved separately by way of a consent order dated 10 September 2013 (the “CO”).

11     The salient terms of the CO were as follows:

> 5.    Orders Made (by consent): -

>> (1)    The Plaintiff shall pay the sum of $3,000.00 a month as maintenance for the two children of the marriage, namely \[K1\] and \[K2\] ("the children"), being 55% of their living expenses, with effect from 1 October 2013 and thereafter on the 1st of every month.

>> (2)    In addition, the Plaintiff shall pay 55% and the Defendant shall pay 45% of the following ad-hoc expenses:-

>>> (i)    Eye consultation for \[K1\];

>>> (ii)   IPL for \[K1\];

>>> (iii) Assessment, treatment and management of \[K2\]'s dyslexia (if assessed);

>>> (iv) Spectacles for the two children;

>>> (v) \[T\] holiday program, which is agreed, and any other enrichment programs by mutual consent.

>> (3)    In the event \[K2\] has to attend dyslexia classes, the Plaintiff and the Defendant shall equally share the taxi or transport costs for her classes once a week.

>> (4)    The joint account in DBS shall be used only for GIRO deduction of utilities and property tax of the matrimonial home. All other deductions to be borne by the parties responsible for them, e.g., income tax of the Plaintiff to be borne by the Plaintiff or other expenses such as maid's levy and children's school fees to be borne by the Defendant.

12     At the time the CO was executed, \[K1\] and \[K2\] were 9 and 6 respectively. \[K1\] was still in primary school, whilst \[K2\] had not yet commenced primary school.

13     Other than children’s maintenance, all other ancillary matters were litigated. This resulted in a separate decision relating to the custody and care and control of the children, division of assets, and spousal maintenance. Those orders were made on 15 August 2017. Those orders were subject to separate cross-appeals by parties, and were substantively dismissed (save that the order for $1 nominal maintenance for the defendant was removed).

### Components of the fixed maintenance sum

14     At the heart of the defendant’s application for an increase in fixed monthly maintenance was broadly (a) the increase in the children’s general expenses due to the effluxion of time,[^1] and (b) \[K1\]’s enrolment to \[B\].[^2] Against that backdrop, it would be necessary to briefly recapitulate what formed the initial components of the fixed maintenance sum under the CO.

15     In this regard, the defendant annexed, which was not disputed, a spreadsheet used as the basis at arriving at the figure of $3,000 in the CO.[^3] This was relied upon and commented on by both parties in their respective affidavits. The list of the children’s expenses was presented in the following terms:

16     The aggregate value of the aforementioned items amounted to approximately $5,900. Given parties’ respective incomes at the time, parties had agreed that the apportionment ratio be 55:45, with the larger portion allocated to the plaintiff.

17     On that basis, a 55% share of the aforementioned sum would have been approximately $3,250. Be that as it may, and perhaps after parties’ further negotiation and compromises at the material time, the plaintiff’s contribution was eventually revised, and agreed to be $3,000 (approximately 51%). In short, parties were, in actual fact, already sharing the children’s expenses equally.

### \[K1\]’s enrolment to \[B\]

18     In 2016, \[K1\] sat for her PSLE. She attained an aggregate score which unfortunately did not allow her to qualify for her preferred local school of choice. Given that the cost relating to her enrolment to \[B\], an international school, was a hotly contested issue, I will deal with those specific circumstances in greater detail later.

19     It suffices to state at the present time that it was not disputed that it was the plaintiff who first broached the idea of \[K1\]’s potential enrolment to an international school. What followed thereafter were fairly lengthy discussions regarding the qualitative and, to a lesser and less specific degree, the financial aspects of enrolling \[K1\] to either a local or international school. This was done principally through a WhatsApp group chat which involved the _entire family_ (which was in excess of 50 pages of the exhibits in D1)[^4].

20     Around late November 2016, \[K1\] received an offer letter from \[B\].[^5] Notwithstanding the offer letter, and arising from certain exchanges between \[K1\] and the plaintiff, the plaintiff appeared to have highlighted his objection towards \[K1\]’s enrolment to \[B\]. This resulted in a further assessment of local secondary schools (principally undertaken by the defendant’s efforts). Without any firm resolution on the matter, and through an effluxion of time, an application was also made to local secondary schools. Even then, and as I will elaborate later, it _could not_ be said that \[B\] was completely off the table.

21     Posting results were released around December 2016, and \[K1\] was allocated a local school. At that point, _both_ \[B\] and the local school options were available. Taking into account \[K1\]’s views and the plaintiff’s contemporaneous comments at the material time, the defendant made the decision to formally accept \[K1\]’s enrolment to \[B\]. The plaintiff subsequently expressed his displeasure with the defendant’s decision and what he purportedly contended to be a clear and express choice for a local school.

22     Be that as it may, \[K1\] was formally enrolled to \[B\], and is still a student of the school. This has been the case since 2017. From the evidence before me, there is no dispute that she is performing reasonably well, and has acclimatised well in her new environment. There is also no dispute that the defendant has been the parent _solely_ bearing \[K1\]’s \[B\] fees. Put another way, for two years, \[K1\] has been in \[B\] (a fact which is cannot be disputed), without any direct financial contribution by the plaintiff apart from the amounts provided in the CO (which _does not_ include the school fees for \[B\]).

## Parties’ respective cases in brief

23     Against that backdrop, I now briefly set out parties’ respective cases in respect of the various heads of claim in SUM 3610.

### Claim 1A:Increase in the fixed maintenance sum (children’s general and specific expenses)

24     I first deal with the defendant’s claim for an increase in the fix maintenance sum from $3,000 to $6,552. For ease of discussion, this claim can be further divided into two sub-claims, namely the increase in the children’s general expenses, and secondly \[K1\]’s international school fees in \[B\].

25     With regard to general expenses, the defendant’s simple case was that the children’s expenses have change significantly since the execution of the CO in September 2013.[^6] In support of her contention, the defendant provide a table of comparison between the children’s expenses in 2013 and the time of the application:[^7]

26     On those figures, the plaintiff’s existing contribution of $3,000 per month was “manifestly insufficient”.[^10]

27     In response, the plaintiff made the following contentions:

> (a)     First, the plaintiff contended that a large proportion of the general items of expenses included by the defendant were items which _already existed_ at the time the CO was made, but that the defendant had “failed to consider \[such items\], or rather deemed that they were not required to be considered”.[^11] In short, the plaintiff contended that this was a belated attempt to inflate the children’s expenses by including expenses which were _already in existence_ at the time of the CO, but were specifically not included.

> (b)     Second, excluding \[K1\]’s \[B\] fees and the items above, as well as the plaintiff’s position on the proper value of expenses, some of the children’s expenses appear to have actually decreased since 2013.[^12]

> (c)     Third, in any case, and insofar as the defendant’s figures show “some”[^13] increase in general expenses (excluding the issue of \[K1\]’s \[B\] fees), the plaintiff contended that the _quantum of increase_ was not significant enough to warrant a variation. The corollary to this was that the increase was something which “the defendant could very well afford on her own income” [^14].

### Claim 1B: Increase in the fixed maintenance sum (\[K1\]’s \[B\] fees)

28     I turn now to \[K1\]’s \[B\] fees.

29     In gist, it was the defendant’s position that an examination of the contemporaneous conversations at the material time showed that the plaintiff had “encouraged and consented to \[K1\] attending \[B\]”.[^15]

30     On the other hand, the plaintiff denied this, and essentially contended that the defendant’s decision to enrol \[K1\] to \[B\] was done _in spite_ of his purportedly clear objections (in term of choice of school and/or fees), and was therefore an expense which was “self-induced”.[^16]

31     Further, the plaintiff contended that the defendant herself was prepared to bear the school fees solely[^17], which, as I mentioned earlier, the defendant has been doing since 2017. And insofar as the defendant did submit evidence of an increase in the school fees contemporaneous to the filing of SUM 3610[^18], the plaintiff contended that the _quantum of increase_ was not material to warrant a variation[^19]. In this regard, and on the documentary evidence available[^20], the increase in fees would approximately $110 per month.

32     In those circumstances, it was the plaintiff’s submission that since the defendant has been shouldering the burden of \[K1\]’s \[B\] fees for two years, and given the marginal increase, this was _not_ a material change in circumstance which justified making any variation to the plaintiff’s detriment.

33     For completeness, the plaintiff also highlighted his “reservations” of the children attending an international school “as the cultural differences and the friends \[K1\] would end up mixing with may cause them \[sic\] to lose their Singaporean values given I was brought up in a traditional Singaporean Chinese family”.[^21] Notwithstanding this assertion, I note that this point was not pursued, rightly in my view, by his counsel, Ms Looi, either in her written or oral submissions. Indeed, nowhere in the corpus of the contemporaneous evidence had the plaintiff raised such an ‘reservation’, which in any case would fly in the face of the _undisputed_ fact that it was the _plaintiff himself_ who broached the idea of K1 attending an international school. At best, the plaintiff’s ‘reservation’ was unsubstantiated, and at worst, gratuitous lip service wholly contradictory to the contemporaneous evidence. I found it apposite to pause here and restate the observations made by the Court of Appeal in _BOI v BOJ_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 2 SLR 1156</span> (at \[2\]) on the duty of lawyers to counsel their clients on the things which are worth saying to justifiably advance their case. Sometimes, as the adage goes, it is _indeed better_ to remain silent.

34     In response, the defendant sought to highlight, amongst other things, that:

> (a)     The plaintiff was the one who first raised the possibility of enrolling \[K1\] to \[B\]. Put another way, _if not_ for the plaintiff making the suggestion in the _family group chat_, international school would never have been on the table.

> (b)     While the issue of funding was discussed, there was no flat-out rejection by the plaintiff that he would not pay for such fees. In this regard, the plaintiff was being indecisive and non-committal on the issue of \[K1\]’s enrolment, but at the same time was deferring the decision to \[K1\] and/or the defendant.

> (c)     Any apparent disapproval or purported neglect to pay was not born out of the plaintiff’s financial capability or the welfare of \[K1\]. Instead, the plaintiff’s unclear and conflicting stance was borne out his personal perception on how the defendant ought to use her share of the matrimonial assets, and his personal feelings towards the defendant and/or \[K1\].[^22]

> (d)     Any acceptance to solely pay for \[K1\]’s school fees, was temporary. [^23]

35     Against this backdrop, counsel for the defendant, Ms Gill, maintained the defendant’s stance at \[29\] above. That said, Ms Gill candidly accepted at the hearing that amidst the vacillating stance adopted by the plaintiff at the material time, the defendant’s decision to opt for the more expensive option was not without its attendant risks.[^24] However, Ms Gill essentially sought to impress on this court that it would fly in the face of reason and/or justice why the plaintiff, as a parent, should be allowed to be absolved of _any_ responsibility to support \[K1\]’s school fees for \[B\],[^25] a school which would never have been on the table if not for the plaintiff’s own suggestion.

### Claim 2: Defendant’s claim to remove the reimbursement clause

36     In support of her claim to remove the reimbursement clause, the defendant’s simple case is that the plaintiff has been difficult and “recalcitrant”[^26] with reimbursement. In this regard, the defendant cited certain incidents where, in essence, the plaintiff was either being pedantic on how the claims were presented by the defendant[^27], or ignoring them completely[^28]. This resulted in the defendant taking out an enforcement summons seeking such reimbursements.

37     In response, while the plaintiff acknowledged issues in payment previously, his position was that such issues were “teething”[^29], and has since been resolved. For completeness, the plaintiff also disputed some of the defendant’s claims.[^30]

### Claim 3: Inclusion of a separate provision on “major medical and dental expenses”

38     In support of this claim, the defendant’s position on affidavit was as follows:

> 62.    The only expenses which ought to be treated separate from the full monthly sum are the children's major medical and dental expenses. Due to the nature of such expenses, it is impossible to budget for them ahead of time. Unexpected emergencies may happen from time to time. If that occurs, it is imperative that the children have access to the funds necessary to provide them with treatment.

> …

> 64.    As such, I have prayed for an order stating that the children's major health-related expenses (including braces) that are not covered by the Plaintiff's employer's medical insurance policy shall be borne by both parties in the proportion of their incomes.

> 65.    I fear that unless there is express provision for the same in an Order the Plaintiff will not contribute. This is because the Plaintiff has expressed his distaste for the children via text and essentially wishes to disown them in favour of a new family. It is however the duty of parents to maintain their children and the Plaintiff's petty personal feelings do not detract from such a legal obligation.[^31]

39     In response, the plaintiff objected to this relief on the basis that there was no need for such a provision, and that “medical expenses have already been provided for in calculating the children’s monthly expenses”.[^32]

40     For clarity, at the time the CO was executed, the plaintiff had allocated an amount of $73.33 towards a bundle of miscellaneous costs including “doctor fees”[^33]. On the apportionment which I highlighted at \[17\] above, the plaintiff’s monthly contribution would be approximately $37.40 (i.e., 51%, assuming that the _entirety_ of the bundle be allocated to such doctor’s fees). In any event the plaintiff further contended that:

> It is clear that the Defendant is also not in financial difficulty. In fact, the Defendant had received about $200,000 from the division of assets from the divorce and till to-date, it has not been used…[^34]

## The law

41     Against that backdrop, I deal briefly with the law.

42     The law regarding the variation of maintenance is not controversial. The relevant statutory provisions applicable in the present case are sections 127 read with 72 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev. Ed) (“WC”).

43     As with any variation application, the principle inquiry is to determine whether there have been any change of circumstance or good cause which necessitates the court invoking its powers to intervene. On the basis that the courts do determine the need to intervene, what follows is essentially an assessment on parties’ financial positions, and the extent to which the payor (in this case the plaintiff) should shoulder the change.

44     Additionally, and given that the application relates to a consent order and maintenance of children, it goes without saying that the court will also be cognizant of the primacy of the children’s welfare above all other factors. This is, in my view, encapsulated in section 73 of the WC.

45     Separately, the present case also touches on certain issues which commonly arise in variation applications which I considered appropriate to comment on.

46     First, this is a case which deals with a _consent order_, which is essentially an agreement made between parties. In this regard:

> (a)     The terms of the CO were executed pursuant to parties’ _own_ deliberations and compromises. In this regard, I restated my earlier observations on the need to hold parties to their self-concluded bargains (see _UNC v UND_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGFC 62</span> (at \[24\]) which they legitimately expect to be upheld. There is a legitimate expectation by both parties that whatever was agreed upon (and the reasonable circumstances leading to that agreement) would be sufficiently conclusive to resolve parties’ disputes at the material time.

> (b)     To my mind, it is not this court’s function to allow parties to revisit their agreements to improve on their previous bargains, or to reverse the compromises they have consciously chosen to make. As will be evident in my analysis in Claim 1A, if parties have chosen to compromise or make concessions on items which were _reasonably foreseeable_ at the time the agreement was made, this court should be slow in allowing a variation on the continued existence of these items. Exceptional circumstances would have to be shown why this court ought to depart from parties’ legitimate expectations of such compromises or concessions have been made earlier.

> (c)     To be clear, this not an exercise in clairvoyance. Given time and space one can ponder and articulate an infinite number of permutations of the types of expenses to be incurred by children. In my view, the crux of the inquiry is whether the omitted expense flows reasonably and with sufficient proximity with the expenses forming part of the agreement for this court to prevent the matter from being revisited. This will ultimately depend on the specific circumstances of each case.

> (d)     Separately, and as highlighted by the Court of Appeal in _AYM v AYL_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 1 SLR 924</span> (in the context of division of assets) (at \[29\]), in situations where the _underlying basis of the agreement_ is either invalidated, rendered redundant or unworkable, the court’s powers can justifiably be invoked to make the necessary variations to give effect to what parties had originally objectively intended. This would be an unworkability apparent on the face of the agreement.

47     The second point is the issue of self-inducement. In this regard:

> (a)     As I had stated in _UYH v UYI_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGFC 73</span> (_“UYH”)_ (at \[93(j)\]), it is my view that the inquiry of self-inducement is predicated on the assessment of whether the decision made by a party was one which was sufficiently inexplicable or imprudent, giving rise to the inference that it was made more out of design than of circumstance. This would be the underlying basis of the decisions dealing with the topic of self-inducement (be it a payor seeking to reduce maintenance, or a payee seeking an increase in payment).

> (b)     In this regard, the inquiry of self-inducement necessitates examining the culpability of the decision against the circumstances of each specific case. In the present case, it necessitated examining the interplay between the relevant parties at the material time. In this regard, I had also stated in _UYH_ that family dynamics and the process of decision-making are never straightforward matters. Not infrequently, parents find themselves in a position where they are genuinely unable to properly articulate their concerns, causing the matter to be dragged on. The family unit is the domain where parties naturally express themselves in a less polished fashion (coupled with their inherent emotions and vulnerabilities) as compared to commercial correspondence. In the process, sometimes things are said or done driven more out of emotion than of rationale reflection.

> (c)     To this extent, I was of the view that it would be incorrect to undertake what I would call a hypercritical or excessively syntactical analysis of what was said between family members (especially against the backdrop of tense relationships and family proceedings) to ascertain parties’ conduct in determining whether there was self-inducement. To be clear, this _does not_ prevent the court from undertaking a more in-depth analysis of the facts where necessary, but not one with the principal intent of finding fault.

> (d)     That having been said, any such latitude _cannot be taken too far_, and it is not my view that parties have free reign to conduct themselves with complete impunity. To my mind, and especially for parents when it comes to addressing their children’s welfare, there must be a level of rationality, reasonableness, and decisiveness (rightly or wrongly) in dealing with such matters. Certain expressions ought to be made with sufficient clarity and consistency, without which, nothing can move. If a parent chooses to operate without any meaningfully, with sufficient direction, and with sufficient reasonableness, he or she should not expect this court’s protection to unravel any decisions ultimately made which he or she is unhappy with.

## Analysis and my findings

48     I now turn to my analysis and findings on the defendant’s claims.

### Claim 1A

49     On the defendant’s claim for an increase in fixed maintenance, I first deal with the children’s expenses. This can be broken down to 3 sub-categories – (1) the children’s common expenses, (2) \[K1\]’s expenses (excluding school fees for \[B\]), and (3) \[K2\]’s expenses. At \[15\] above, I had listed out the expenses which formed part of the CO.

50     For ease of reference, I reproduce the relevant portion of those expenses vis-à-vis what the defendant had sought to claim for in the present application, and my findings on the same.

#### (1)   Children’s common expenses

51     The defendant’s claim in relation to the children’s common expenses were as follows:[^35]

52     Just from a cursory reading of the aforementioned table, it will be apparent that the defendant’s original valuation of expenses at the time of the CO was S$2,447.38. At the time of her present application, this value has dropped to $2,121.43, _which includes the new items of expense_ (see items 16 to 21 above).[^38]

53     This results in a nett benefit to the plaintiff which I was prepared to accept fully.

54     Whilst it would have been convenient to simply have adopted the defendant’s figure wholly given that it was lower than the original value, I was of the view that in light of the observations I made at \[46\] above, further deductions were necessary.

55     In this regard, items 16 to 19 dealt with _other_ expenses related to the domestic helper (i.e., medical, return air ticket, agency fees and etc). After assessing parties’ submissions, I was inclined to accept the plaintiff’s submission that given that these were expenses which were consciously omitted from the calculation in the CO, _it should not be included in the present figures_. I was of the view that those expenses not only flowed reasonably with the helpers’ salary and levy[^39], but were in fact so _inextricably linked_ that those costs must have naturally been on the defendant’s mind when dealing with the helper’s salary and levy. Put another way, it could not be said that the omission of those expenses were unintended given the proximity of the other expenses related to the maid.

56     Therefore, the necessary inference to be made was that the defendant consciously chose to make the compromise and concession to exclude those items, which the plaintiff was entitled to and did rely on. Further, there was nothing to suggest that the defendant was unable to maintain these sums which she had agreed to omit in the CO.

57     For the same reasons, but to a lesser extent, I was of the view that items 20 (air conditioning) and 21 (repair and replacement of electronic goods) were items which were within reasonable contemplation and sufficient degree of proximity with the items initially provided for in the CO, and were general expenses associated with the maintenance of the house and other miscellaneous expenses.

58     For those reasons, I rejected items 16 to 21 being included into the defendant’s calculation of the children’s common expenses. This amounted to a final nett sum of $1,894.21. In recognition that there would be general fluctuations with such common expenses in the future and with the hope of preventing further litigation, I was inclined to make a modest adjustment and value this bundle of expenses as $1,950, an increase of $60.

60     With regard to \[K1\], items 1 to 10 (save for item 3) were expenses which were originally included in the CO.

61     I would pause here and note that the inclusion of some of these items would have, in my view, rendered various provisions in the reimbursement clause at paragraph 5(2) of the CO to be redundant otiose. Specifically, items 5 to 7 were items which were also included in the reimbursement clause. In short, there were items of expenses which applied both to the reimbursement clause and the fixed monthly sum

62     In other words, without the reimbursement clause, and regardless of whether a claim had been made, the defendant has already been receiving monies for those items under the fixed maintenance sum in the CO. For the reasons I provided at \[91\] to \[99\] below, I was more inclined to remove the relevant provisions in the reimbursement clause which dealt with the items already provided for in the CO, and not vice versa.

63     I now turn to the specific items claimed by the defendant:

> (a)     Item 1 – Given that that expense was no longer applicable, I accepted the reduction to the plaintiff’s benefit.

> (b)     Items 2 and 3 – I was inclined to accept the defendant’s calculation of \[K1\]’s tuition expenses as reasonable. I did not accept the plaintiff’s submission that he was kept completely in the dark on \[K1\]’s educational matters. I further accepted the defendant’s submissions that tuition costs are by and large fluid, and would change depending on \[K1\]’s needs at the material time.

> (c)     Item 4 – I will deal with \[K1\]’s school fees in greater detail at paragraphs \[67\] to \[81\] below.

> (d)     Items 5 to 7 – For the reasons I have explained in respect of Claim 2 below, I have retained these items in the general pool of expenses, and removed the same from the reimbursement clause. With regard to item 7, given that the defendant herself had reduced the value of that expense, I was prepared for the plaintiff to have the benefit of that reduction. As for the other items, their value remained the same as previously provided for in the CO.

> (e)     Items 8, 9, 10, and 17 – I was prepared to accept the defendant’s calculation for school books and pocket money as reasonable, especially in light of my decision below to accept that \[K1\]’s fees in \[B\] be included. As regards 10 and 17, I was more inclined to allow a global figure of S$50 for \[K1\]’s shoes and clothes.

> (f)     Item 11 – I found that S$16.67 per month for a girl’s haircut (i.e., $200 a year) was not wholly unreasonable. I rejected the plaintiff’s argument that S$4 per month ($48 a year) was reasonable for a girl’s haircut.

> (g)     Item 12 – I accepted the plaintiff’s submission that his insurance covered basic dental coverage for the children, and was not inclined to include this figure on the premise that the defendant made the necessary claims under his plan. Should he not do that, that is a separate avenue for the defendant to seek the necessary recourse at the material time.

> (h)     Items 13 to 16, and 18 – These expenses related to birthdays and outings with the children. After assessing parties’ submissions and considering the matter, I was inclined not to include these items of expenses. These are expenses which parties would principally be spending on their own when they have their personal time with the children.

> (i)     Items 19 to 22 – These expenses relate to Chinese New Year expenses, separate personal toiletries, \[K1\]’s eye-drops and mobile phone. I was inclined to include these items as reasonable expenses principally borne by the defendant given the duration of time spent with the children. I also found the sums stated to be broadly within reasonable limits.

#### (3)   Variation in \[K2\]’s expenses

64     I now turn to \[K2\]’s expenses. In this regard, the defendant’s valued the expenses as follows:[^44]

65     With regard to each of the items claimed by the defendant:

> (a)     Item 1 – Given that this item was agreed, I saw no reason to depart from the defendant’s reduce figure and for the plaintiff to benefit from the same.

> (b)     Items 2, 18, 19, and 20 – For the same reasons as stated at \[63(b)\] above, I was prepared to accept the defendant’s quantification in respect of the children’s tuition.

> (c)     Items 3 to 6 – As these items of expenses no longer existed, the plaintiff would benefit from the overall reduction of these costs.

> (d)     Item 7 – This item relates to \[K2\]’s primary school fees amounting to $6.50. At the time of the CO, \[K2\] was not enrolled in primary school yet. While the basis of the plaintiff’s objection is not clear[^45], it was fairly evident that the plaintiff was not agreeing to this figure. I saw no basis for the plaintiff’s position, and accordingly allowed this sum to be included.

> (e)     Item 8 – For the same reasons stated at \[63(f)\] with regard to \[K1\]’s haircut, I similarly allowed the costs in respect of \[K2\]’s haircut.

> (f)     Item 9 – For the same reasons stated at \[63(g)\] above, I was prepared not to include this item on the basis that the children’s basic dental needs would be promptly addressed by the plaintiff’s insurance policy.

> (g)     Items 10 to 13 and 15 – For the same reasons at \[63(h)\] above, I was not inclined to include these expenses.

> (h)     Item 14 – Similar to \[K1\], I allowed \[K2\]’s expenses for clothes and shoes to be valued at a global sum of $50.

> (i)     Item 16, 17, and 24 – for the same reasons at \[63(i)\] above, I allowed these expenses.

> (j)     Item 23 – I found the defendant’s valuation of $80 for \[K2\]’s pocket money to be broadly within reasonable limits, and accordingly allowed for the same.

> (k)     Items 21, 22, 25, 26, and 27 – These items of expenses were provided for in the reimbursement clause. As I was not inclined to remove the reimbursement clause, I similarly disallowed these items to be included into the general pool of expenses.

### Claim 1B

67     I now turn to Claim 1B, specifically \[K1\]’s school fees for \[B\].

68     After assessing parties’ evidence and submissions, I was not inclined to accept the plaintiff’s submissions that the defendant’s decision to enrol \[K1\] to \[B\] was an act of self-inducement. Further and/or alternatively, I was _not_ inclined to accept that the plaintiff should not be made to bear _any responsibility_ for contributing to \[K1\]’s school fees moving forward.

69     In arriving at my decision, I first found it apposite at this juncture to go through certain key points of the parties’ discussions in relation to \[K1\]’s choice of school after she received her PSLE results. In the present case, I found it necessary to go into some detail as to the plaintiff’s behaviour over the relevant period of time when \[K1\]’s secondary school choice was in play. It was through this analysis where issues with the plaintiff’s conduct were more apparent.

70     Turning now to the plaintiff’s conduct at the material time:

> (a)     It was not disputed that it was the plaintiff who _first_ broached the idea of enrolling \[K1\] to an international school.[^46] Notwithstanding the fact that it was the plaintiff who raised the idea, and that the defendant made the effort to share with the plaintiff the International Baccalaureate (“IB”) programme and fees, the plaintiff curiously asked the defendant:

>> Can _you_ afford \[K1\] going to international school.[^47] (emphasis added)

> (b)     It was as if the plaintiff suggested international school, but had no intention in discharging his parental responsibility to financially support \[K1\].

> (c)     When queried by \[K1\], the plaintiff’s response was that the defendant had “received a lot of money from me from divorce”.[^48] The upshot of the plaintiff’s statement was that because of what the defendant obtained via the division of assets, the plaintiff was no longer obliged to contribute any further to the children.

> (d)     I would pause here and simply state that the plaintiff’s statement is simply without merit.

> (e)     What followed thereafter, in my view, were somewhat unnecessary personal attacks against the defendant[^49]. When \[K1\] sought to defend her mother[^50], the plaintiff simply sought to disengage and told her to ask the defendant to “sort out your future for you”.[^51] This was subsequently followed by further emotive language by the plaintiff. I would pause here and express some regret on how the children had to openly witness (albeit in a group chat) the plaintiff’s conduct against the defendant.

> (f)     Notwithstanding the exchange between the plaintiff and \[K1\], the defendant sought to bring the conversation back on track. At that point, the plaintiff then informed \[K1\] to obtain funding from her grandparents.[^52] Once again, the plaintiff wished for \[K1\] to follow up on enrolling to an international school, but _did not wish to have any financial responsibility for the same_.

> (g)     Perhaps sensing the plaintiff’s wavering, the defendant asked the plaintiff whether he was keen on \[K1\] going to an international school.[^53] The plaintiff appeared to have singularly focused on the topic of funding, saying “who will fund it”[^54] and “no use looking at \[international school\] if there is no funding”[^55].

> (h)     Once again, this was following by the plaintiff going on another a personal, and somewhat unhelpful, tirade against the defendant.[^56]

> (i)     Notwithstanding this, the defendant was, rightly in my view, level-headed enough to have the conversation focus towards the decision of whether to go for an international or local school. The defendant was cognizant of plaintiff’s funding ‘concerns’, and suggested focusing on local options.[^57] When seeking the plaintiff’s confirmation, his response, almost repeating himself, was:

>> I don’t know.

>> What does \[K1\] want? Does she have funding?[^58]

> (j)     I would pause here and observe and this was the first time where the plaintiff chose _not_ to take the matter head on, only to be evasive and circuitous in his response.

> (k)     What followed was another spate of ranting by the plaintiff about the division of the matrimonial assets, which the defendant expressly stated she was saving for the children’s university. This was followed by the plaintiff’s somewhat cynical comment of the utility of that plan, as \[K1\] may not go to university if she went to a “lousy school”.

> (l)     Once again, the defendant asked the plaintiff whether he still felt that going to an international school was better for \[K1\].[^59] It is at this point where the defendant mentioned her understanding that \[B\]’s school fees were $1,400 per month. When asked by the plaintiff again about funding, the defendant said:

>> I think I can fund it _for now if_ the extra is $1,400. I think the fees do increase a bit over the 6 years. [^60] (emphasis added)

> (m)     The plaintiff then responded:

>> What do you mean you will fund her for now. I give the kids $3,000 a month.[^61]

> (n)     It suffices to pause here to note that I accepted the defendant’s submissions that her preparedness to fund for \[K1\]’s school fees was _not intended to be permanent_. Indeed, the plaintiff’s immediate response (or retort) left no doubt as to his understanding of the defendant’s position. It was also evident from the plaintiff’s statement that on the misguided premise I highlighted to at \[69(c)\] above, the plaintiff demanded the defendant to utilise the monies awarded via division to fund this additional cost.[^62]

> (o)     More importantly, the above exchange made it clear that _the plaintiff was alive_ to the point that the fixed S$3,000 under the CO _would not be sufficient to cover the school fees_. In my view, this must be the inference because if not, there would not have been the need for the plaintiff to demand the defendant to use the monies received from division. Further, at the time the CO was executed, there was no provision for \[K1\]’s international school fees. In short, the plaintiff simply did not want to pay for \[K1\]’s school fees on his belief on how the defendant ought to be using the monies she received from the division of assets.

> (p)     Moving on, when pressed again on whether it was ok for \[K1\] to apply to \[B\][^63], the plaintiff again went back to the same position of “who is going to pay”[^64]. He goes further to state:

>> I _am ok_ with \[K1\]’s decision. But pls find funding.[^65] (emphasis added)

> (q)     Attempting to close the point of, the defendant once again put the point plainly:

>> So if there is no funding u r ok with local school?

> (r)      _Once again_, without assisting the situation, the plaintiff simply decided that the defendant would “have to decide and tell \[him\]”.[^66] Seeking clarity, the defendant then went to say:

>> You are giving me the authority to decide? Since you said you are ok we’ll go ahead.[^67]

> (s)     The plaintiff responded by stating:

>> _Like I said, I am ok with international_. But where will funding be from? What does \[K1\] want? (emphasis added)

71     For the exchange presented, it was clear that the plaintiff was simply going in loops about stating his apparent acquiescence for to \[K1\] going to an international school and his perennial question of funding, which essentially translate to mean that he’s happy for \[K1\] to go international school so long as he was not paying for it. When pushed to make a clear decision that if the question of funding was not answered _to the plaintiff’s liking / preference_ that \[K1\] would be sent to local school, the plaintiff restarted the whole conversation loop.

72     Returning back to the key events:

> (a)     What followed was the plaintiff’s questioning \[K1\] on why she wanted to do the IB programme. The plaintiff went as far as querying \[K1\] on what she was going to do to ‘prove her worth’ to be able to be enrolled to the IB programme.[^68]

> (b)     On 26 November 2016, the defendant informed the plaintiff that \[K1\] was offered a place to \[B\], and asked whether they should accept it. The plaintiff’s immediate answer was that it was “up to \[K1\]”[^69]. To my mind, this was an unequivocal confirmation of the plaintiff’s confirmation of \[K1\]’s decision on the school, which would have placed matters to rest.

> (c)     However, on the same day, and perhaps in connection with other matters, \[K1\] wrote a fairly lengthy response to one of the plaintiff’s comments denigrating the defendant.[^70]

> (d)     In response, the plaintiff said the following:

>> If you feel that you \[sic\] dad is evil than \[sic\] forget about going to \[B\]. I object to it then.

>> …

>> No \[B\]. I think you need to learn the hard way then.[^71]

73     Notably, at this juncture, the defendant then responded to list out the choice of local schools. I was prepared to accept that the defendant wished for the matter to move on, and to a certain extent accepted the plaintiff’s objection (rightly or wrongly) as the decision on the matter.[^72]

74     From this point on:

> (a)     Notwithstanding her confirmation on the choice of local schools (without any specific input from the plaintiff)[^73], \[K1\] maintained her preference to do the IB programme. What followed shortly thereafter was the plaintiff seeking some vindication of the “hurt” \[K1\] had allegedly caused her. Essentially, the plaintiff re-stated his position for \[K1\] to go to a local school.[^74]

> (b)     About 2 days later (29 November 2016), and concurrent with the submission of local school choices, the defendant again asked the plaintiff about international school.[^75] Given how family decisions evolve, I would discern this as the defendant getting the final confirmation from the plaintiff.

> (c)     What can be discerned from the subsequent messages was the plaintiff’s indignance on what he considered to be rude behaviour couple with more disparaging comments against the defendant, and stating that:

>> \[K1\] is going to local school unless you educate her properly.[^76]

75     At this juncture, I was of the view that the plaintiff’s objection was, in the circumstances, _not_ borne from any real or meaningful reservation of \[B\], but rather, his discontentment with \[K1\] and the defendant. Against the backdrop of those comments being made by the plaintiff _in the family group chat_, the defendant responded, correctly in my view:

> …if you are making the decision for local school just to “teach her a lesson”, then you are not acting \[sic\] her best interest.[^77]

76     Following from the defendant’s aforementioned statement were further disparaging remarks against the defendant and how she raised the children.

77     At this juncture, it would appear that, rightly or wrongly, the direction was for local school over international school. However, on the following day, the plaintiff asked the defendant the percentage of students from a local school and IB which qualified for junior college. [^78] This, in my view, was clearly for the purposes of assessing the difference between a local and international school. More pertinently, and notwithstanding his earlier position, this indicated that the plaintiff was still keeping his options open.

78     Accordingly, it could not be conclusively said, contrary to the plaintiff’s assertions, that he had closed the door on \[B\]. At best, he had stated a position (wrongly and irrationally in my view) he was inclined to. If the plaintiff’s mind was made up, what follows in the next sequence of events would not have happened:

> (a)     On 1 December 2016, and after all the research which _the defendant provided to the plaintiff_, the defendant updated the plaintiff that there were 15 vacancies left in \[B\].

> (b)     In response, the plaintiff stated:

>> _If \[K1\] acknowledges that I have been supporting her then go ahead_. But funding how?

>> She needs to know how much her dad is suffering and I still need to clean things up after messes are made. (emphasis added)[^79]

> (c)     Once again, the plaintiff reverted back to his circuitous position acquiescing \[K1\]’s enrolment to \[B\] on his hanging, non-committal, self-serving, and unhelpful ‘query’ on funding. This was also against the backdrop of \[K1\]’s clear desire to enrol to the IB programme. Further, the tenor of the plaintiff’s statement was also for \[K1\] to display some form of repentance and contrition to what he perceived as \[K1\]’s disrespectful comments to him when she defended the defendant.

> (d)     But more importantly, by this time, it was even clearer that the plaintiff was _not_ objecting to \[K1\]’s enrolment to \[B\].

> (e)     On 21 December 2016, the defendant received \[K1\]’s posting notification to a local school. Upon receiving this, \[K1\] once again stated her desire to go to \[B\].

> (f)     Against that backdrop, the defendant said:

>> Mummy will support your decision since it is in your interest.

>> We will need to inform \[KR\] tomorrow about the change in schools.[^80]

> (g)     What followed thereafter was the plaintiff contention that he did not agree to the defendant’s decision, followed by more disparaging comments against the defendant, with an argument ensuing.[^81] To conclude the plaintiff stated:

>> \[Defendant\] – \[K1\] told me that you enrolled her in \[B\]. I didn’t agree and you went ahead. Please make sure she is well funded to get through it.

>> As I opted for \[KR\] and you didn’t listen. You have already violated the court agreement for joint custody.

> (h)     In response, the defendant stated the following:

>> U \[sic\] were the one who initiated the option of international school and even said to go ahead when I informed there are only 15 vacancies left. Please don't send confusing messages especially where timelines are tight. And turn around after that and say you didn't agree. You have never once put on the chat messages that your option is \[KR\], in fact you insinuated it's a lousy school and that she may not make it to uni. And even questioned the percentage of \[KR\] students making it to uni.

>> …

>> If your main issue is funding, I would have asked for increase in maintenance whether it's a local or international school. As all expenses are going up anyway.[^82]

79     Separately, and from the evidence submitted, \[K1\]’s fees were not $1,400 per month, but instead $2,200 per month (i.e., $6,600 per term).[^83] It is not in dispute that the defendant was funding this _solely_ by herself. As I had highlighted earlier, in a letter dated 2 August 2018, the fees were revised to $6,930 per term (i.e., $2,310 per month).

80     As I had stated earlier, I was not inclined to accept the plaintiff’s submission that \[B\]’s school fees be omitted from \[K1\]’s pool of expenses principally on the grounds of self-inducement, and for such expenses to _continue_ to be solely funded by the defendant. In this regard:

> (a)     First, I was satisfied on the evidence before me that it could not be said that the plaintiff put forward any meaningful reservation towards \[K1\] attending \[B\]. This is separate from the undisputed fact that the plaintiff himself suggested that option, never did the plaintiff every state that \[B\] was a bad school for \[K1\]. Indeed, I was further prepared to accept that his ‘objection’ against \[B\] was not borne out of a real and/or justifiable concern of \[K1\]’s welfare or a serious lack of financial capability, but an unwarranted means of punishing her for speaking up for the defendant against the plaintiff.

> (b)     Second, I would accept the plaintiff’s submission that funding was a perennial ‘concern’ or ‘caveat’ in his conversations regarding \[B\]. However, in my view, it was necessary to appreciate _the nature and context of that concern_. As I mentioned earlier, the plaintiff’s concern was not so much whether international school was a broadly affordable option, but rather, his own self-centred and misconceived desire not to pay for such education. Instead, the plaintiff was more fixated that the defendant use the monies from the division of matrimonial assets, intended for her, to be used solely on the children. In summary, it was almost as if the plaintiff was not too bothered where \[K1\] went, so long as he did not have to pay for it. This was not a case of a genuine issue of financial capability (which I will touch on later) or welfare of \[K1\], but simply that he just did not want to pay for it. In my judgment, that was simply an untenable position to take. What was perhaps more puzzling was the plaintiff’s inability to have the mettle to state his position directly and maintain it.

> (c)     Third, and related to the second, the plaintiff’s aforementioned position was simply untenable because there was no basis for him to insist that the defendant fund the school fees from the division of matrimonial assets. It is trite that what the defendant received post-division was _her entitlement arising from the breakdown of the marriage_. It is a redistribution of the assets they have jointly built up through their financial and non-financial contributions. When viewed in this light, the plaintiff’s contention makes even less sense because the plaintiff is effectively saying that what the defendant had received ought to be used solely for \[K1\], which then comes back to the same point that the plaintiff _would still not be contributing anything_. To close off the point, I accepted the statements made by the Court of Appeal in the decision of _BPC v BPB_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGCA 3</span> (at \[112\]) cited by the defendant of the distinction between matrimonial division and child maintenance.

> (d)     Fourth, and even if the plaintiff’s position was untenable, it must be noted that the defendant was made alive of the issue of funding. This much could not be disputed. The more important question was whether this would be sufficient to place the defendant on notice such that the decision against the plaintiff’s underlying preference (i.e., that he doesn’t want to pay) was sufficiently imprudent to constitute self-inducement? This was especially given that at least on two occasions, the defendant herself appeared to have implicitly conceded to the fact that the local school approach would be adopted.

> (e)     In assessing the evidence holistically, I was inclined to answer this question in the negative. In my view, the lack of decisiveness and the flip-flopping clearly showed that the plaintiff either (i) was not prepared to take a firm position, or (ii) simply wanted the gratification (i.e. repentance and contrition from \[K1\] and/or the defendant) as a means to assert himself. Indeed, this was clear when the plaintiff sought, _inter alia_, (i) for \[K1\] to prove her worth, (ii) statistics of university admissions rate between local and international schools even after making a decision (statistics which the plaintiff did not have to lift a finger as the defendant was doing most of the research), and (iii) seeking acknowledgement from \[K1\] that the plaintiff has been supporting her. To my mind, all this _does not_ point towards a person who was raising real and serious concerns, but a person who simply bore a grudge and could not get past the resentment and make a proper and rational choice.

> (f)     Fifth, an insofar as the defendant did mention her amenability to fund the school fees, I stated earlier that I was prepared to accept that (i) it was not intended to be permanent, and (ii) it was predicated on a mistaken assumption on the actual school fees. Even then, the defendant was prepared to shoulder the difference, and was equally prepared not to seek backdated maintenance. Further, I was not inclined to accept Ms Looi’s submission that the defendant ought to continue paying by focusing on the _increase_ in school fees from $6,600 per term to $6,930 per term. To my mind, that completely misses the point that the defendant should not have had to shoulder the $6,600 solely in the first place.

> (g)     Sixth, and insofar as \[K1\] had contemporaneously been accepted to a local school, I placed little weight to that development because that posting notification was not borne out of the plaintiff’s firm position for \[K1\] to go to an local school, but merely through the effluxion of time. To my mind, it does not lie in the plaintiff’s mouth to state that he expressly chose \[KR\] (which he did not) or that it was against the backdrop of his real objection to \[B\] (which I have highlighted above which was without merit).

81     For those reasons, I was inclined to include the school fees for \[B\] into \[K1\]’s expenses.

### Summary for Claim 1

82     On that basis, the overall expenses for the children is as follows:

### Plaintiff’s financial capability, and corresponding proportion of his contribution

83     Following from the above, the next issue I had to deal with was the apportionment of the expenses.

84     As I highlighted earlier, under the CO, the effective distribution between parties was almost equal. In her submissions, the defendant submitted that the proportions should be revised to 67:33, with the defendant bearing the greater burden in light of their salaries. Based on parties’ payslips disclosed, the defendant has a take home salary of approximately $11,150[^84], whereas the plaintiff’s take home salary is approximately $21,300[^85].

85     It is trite that the _starting point_ of apportioning the financial burden children’s expenses is _not_ the relative proportion of the parties’ salaries. This is _not inconsistent_ with the case of _TIT v TIU and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHCF 8</span> cited in the defendant’s submissions.[^86] While parties’ incomes are a relevant factor, it should not be viewed solely from that lens. If parties were able to afford an equal share, there was no sound reason in logic or principle to have the wealthier party shoulder a greater burden purely on income (see _TBC v TBD_ \[2015\] 4 SLR 49).

86     On that basis, and equal share would be approximately $3,875. The question is whether the parties (more particularly the defendant) could shoulder that.

87     In her evidence, the defendant valued her expenses to be approximately $7,800.[^87] When coupled with the ½ share of expenses I valued above together with the expenses parties would spend separately with the children, the defendant would be in a nett deficit. I pause here and separately note that evidence was adduced of the defendant’s dwindling savings (not that it was exhausted). On balance, I was not inclined to accept the thrust of the plaintiff’s submission that this still meant that the defendant was in a position to pay for the increase expenses. In this connection, I was also not inclined to accept the plaintiff’s submission that the plaintiff could afford the increase of expenses on account of what she receive during division.

88     On the other hand, there would be a clear surplus on the plaintiff side. In this regard, the plaintiff asserted that his expenses currently exceed his income.[^88] In support of this contention, he furnished a 2-page document of his monthly list of expenses[^89], which includes, amongst other things:

> (a)     Income tax payments - $3,046;

> (b)     Meals - $2,700

> (c)     Property tax - $3,333

> (d)     Loan repayments - $15,376 (two loans of $9,376 and $6,000)

> (e)     IVF treatment - $4,166

89     I would first state that the plaintiff provided little, if any, supporting evidence of these expenses. For instance, the plaintiff furnished no documents in relation with the loan requiring a monthly repayment of $6,000 (a loan from the plaintiff’s parents), or the IVF treatment. As regards income tax and property tax, I accepted the defendant’s response[^90] that these figures were overinflated. For instance, the documentary evidence shows that for property tax, the plaintiff’s real monthly outlay would be approximately $290 per month, and _not_ $3,333 as alleged. This is but one example of the not insignificant (and unsubstantiated) inflations to the plaintiff’s costs. I would only record my reservations as to how the plaintiff had chosen to declare his finances, particular given his present employment. I would additionally note that _nowhere_ in the written submissions was the _plaintiff’s lack of finances_ highlighted. Instead, the plaintiff chose to focus on the defendant’s financial capability.[^91]

90     Be that as it may, after assessing the evidence, I was not inclined to take the defendant’s apportionment, but made modest adjustments to the same. In this regard, I assessed a more reasonable proportion to be 40:60, with the plaintiff’s share being a rounded figure of $4,700. This amounted to a moderate increase of $1,700 from the CO executed more than 5 years ago, an amount which, on the plaintiff’s own documents, would be absorbed by the plaintiff’s overstatement of his property tax alone.

### Claim 2

91     I now turn to the defendant’s second claim in respect of the reimbursement clause. To recap, I made the following orders in respect of this particular claim:

> (a)     First, against the plaintiff’s prayers, I retained the reimbursement clause, but removed selected items which, upon a further analysis of parties’ evidence, was already provided for in the fixed maintenance sum;

> (b)     second, I revised the apportionment of distribution from 55:45 to 60:40 for consistency with my findings for Claim 1; and

> (c)     third, I included supplementary terms to clarify the reimbursement terms.

92     Given that the plaintiff has appealed against the entirety of my orders, I deal with each of the variations below.

#### 1st Variation: Removal of certain items from the reimbursement clause

93     Turning to the first variation. To recap, the reimbursement clause in the CO deals with 5 categories of expenses[^92]:

> (a)     eye consultation for \[K1\];

> (b)     IPL for \[K1\];

> (c)     assessment, treatment and management of \[K2\]’s dyslexia;

> (d)     spectacles for the children; and

> (e)     \[T\] holiday program and other mutually agreed enrichment program.

94     After assessing parties’ evidence and as I had indicated earlier, I noted that items (a), (b), and (d) (insofar as it related to \[K1\]), _was already an expense factored into the basket of expenses constituting the plaintiff’s $3,000 fixed monthly contribution_. This would appear to mean that the plaintiff had essentially agreed to providing a fixed monthly sum on a particular head of expense (regardless of whether the amount would have been expended for that particular month), _and additionally_, pay 55% of such expenses on a reimbursement basis if and when such expenses were actually incurred. When read in its totality, the plaintiff, in essence, had agreed to pay for the _entirety_ of such expense.

95     Whilst I accept that it is not within the purview of this court to rewrite parties’ bargains, including bad bargains, I was satisfied that the present circumstances justified invoking the court’s powers under section 127 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev. Ed) (“WC”) to remove the aforementioned items in the reimbursement clause. To my mind, on the plain reading of paragraphs 5(1) and 5(2) of the CO, both provisions were intended to deal with _separate types of expenses (i.e., fixed expenses and ad-hoc expenses)_. Put another way, parties _could not_ have intended for the _same_ expenses in paragraphs 5(1) and 5(2) to overlap each other. That would be tantamount to reading a particular expense _to be both_ a fixed and ad-hoc expense, which, in my view, would be internally inconsistent, self-contradictory, and render either provisions to be redundant.

96     Additionally, such an interpretation would give rise to an unfair result. If such an unfair result as highlighted at \[94\] above was indeed intended, it is an established canon of construction that clear words are required to support such a construction (see Lewison, _The Interpretation of Contracts_, 5th Edition, Sweet & Maxwell)(at 7.18)).

97     In my view, this was not evident in the present case.

98     To my mind, allowing the provision to remain in the present form would be to continue something which was _radically different_ from what parties had, on a plain reading of the CO, originally intended. This would render the _underlying basis_ of reimbursement clause, at least insofar as the three items I stated above were replicated therein to either be invalidated, rendered redundant or substantively unworkable. In such a situation, the court would be empowered to make the necessary variation to address, in my view, a fundamental error in parties’ agreement.

99     For completeness, and whilst this position _was not_ submitted before me, another possible interpretation would be that the fixed sum may have dealt with a particular expense _up to a cap_, with the reimbursement clause intended to be an apportionment of the cost of that same item _exceeding the cap_. As I mentioned earlier, such an interpretation would necessitate clear language and/or evidence, which was absent in this case.

100    Given the overlap, the next issue which the court had to deal with was how it was to be rectified. This involved either (a) removing those overlapping expenses from the fixed maintenance sum, or (b) the reimbursement clause. Given the nature of the plaintiff’s appeal, his position would be to have those expenses removed from the pool of fixed expenses. After assessing parties’ positions, I was not inclined to accept the plaintiff’s submission for the following reasons:

> (a)     First, the plaintiff’s contention would hold water if he was able to establish that the listing in the reimbursement clause would supersede those in the fixed reimbursement clause. However, no evidence was submitted to that effect. In fact, the plaintiff himself, in rejecting the additional heads of expenses for the children’s common expenses, aligned his position, which I accepted, _on the sanctity of the table of expenses tendered by the defendant for the purposes of the CO_.[^93] It does not lie in the mouth of the plaintiff to either align or distance himself from the CO to his personal preference or advantage.

> (b)     Insofar as the plaintiff asserted that the reimbursement clause was agreed on the basis that “some payments that are incurred sporadically and not on a regular basis”[^94] be left in the reimbursement clause, this would be inconsistent with the fact that _if not for_ the defendant’s application, the plaintiff was happy to pay the fixed sum of $3000, which already included items also covered in the reimbursement clause. This was the bargain the plaintiff himself accepted, which I saw no reason to depart from. Separately, I would pause here and note that even if expenses were properly included in the reimbursement clause (i.e., \[K2\]’s spectacles), the plaintiff himself took the view that he was not obliged to make such payment.[^95] On the evidence before me, it was clear that the plaintiff was prepared to take whichever position possible (notwithstanding it being contradictory) so long as he does not have to pay more than the $3000 he agreed to.

> (c)     Second and following from the above, I was inclined to retain the expense as a fixed sum on the basis that it was the bargain the _plaintiff himself accepted_, which the court will not disturb.

> (d)     Third, retaining the expense as a fixed sum, in light of the plaintiff’s conduct, would provide greater clarity and certainty to the defendant’s affairs with the children. Issues of underutilisation, if any, may be addressed in a separate application not before this court. The corollary to this was that removing this item from the reimbursement clause would provide greater clarity and certainty to _both_ parties insofar as there can be no allegation of over-claiming. Furthermore, by reducing the list, this was actually _in the plaintiff’s favour_.

101    For those reasons, I removed the items of expenses stated at \[94\] above from the reimbursement clause. To be clear, the observations I have made are not intended to be of general application, but are specific to the circumstances of the present case.

#### 2nd Variation: Apportionment of expenses

102    On the second variation, and consistent with my findings with regard to the first claim, I was inclined to make a slight adjustment of the plaintiff’s contribution from 55% (as provided for in the reimbursement clause) to 60%. For the same reasons I highlighted earlier, I was of the view that this marginal adjustment was well within the plaintiff’s financial capability to meet.

#### 3rd Variation: Mechanism of reimbursement

103    As regards the third variation, and giving the plaintiff the benefit of doubt on the “teething issues” for previous non-compliance, I was inclined to provide for more precise terms for the submission and payment of the defendant’s claims. In terms of the mode of submission, I provided for specific modes in which the claims may be presented to the plaintiff. As regards the timeline for payment, I was of the view that reimbursement period of 14 days was reasonable.

104    All these orders were made to give clarity towards the orders given the “issues” raised by the plaintiff in making timely reimbursement. While not the subject of this appeal, and notwithstanding the plaintiff’s conduct I highlighted above, I did not think that it was proportionate to remove the entire clause completely. I would hope that by this clause (as opposed to just a fix maintenance clause), the plaintiff would still be involved in the children’s lives in terms of certain decision making processes.

### Claim 3

105    I now turn to the defendant’s third and final claim regarding “major medical and dental expenses”.

106    At the outset, I had made no order in respect of this prayer. The upshot of my decision was that the defendant _did not_ get what she wanted, and that the plaintiff _did_. In the premises, I found the plaintiff’s present appeal against _the entirety_ of my orders (including this order) to be highly peculiar. Taken to its logical conclusion, by appealing against the entirety of my orders, the plaintiff is dissatisfied, at least in respect of this claim, of making a finding _in his favour_.

107    If that is the case, and the plaintiff wishes for the insertion of the clause as prayed by the defendant, I say no further on the matter.

## Costs of SUM 3610

108    Given that the defendant was holistically successful in her application (albeit not to the extent she had prayed for), I found it appropriate to make costs orders in the defendant’s favour. After hearing parties, I awarded the defendant costs of an incidental to the application (including disbursements) to be fixed at $1,000. I found the quantum to be reasonable in the circumstances of this case.

## Cost of separate discovery proceedings

109    My last order dealt with the defendant’s separate application in SUM 4521/2018 on 21 December 2018 for discovery of some of the plaintiff’s financial documents. The defendant’s application was granted on 4 January 2019. After hearing parties, and given the costs orders I made above, I ordered that parties’ bear their own costs for that particular application. I was of the view that the costs orders made for SUM 3610 would be a more holistic cost order.

## Conclusion

110    For the above reasons, I made the orders as highlighted at Annex A below. It leaves me to thank Ms Looi, Ms Gill and their respective teams for their assistance on the matter.

111    As a final point to the plaintiff - putting aside his misgivings against the defendant (and occasionally the children), at the end of the day, \[K1\] and \[K2\] will need _both_ their parents. This episode may not have gone in his favour, but it will be up to the plaintiff to decide the type of relationship he wishes to have with both his girls moving forward.
