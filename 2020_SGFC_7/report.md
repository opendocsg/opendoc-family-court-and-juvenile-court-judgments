Family law – Variation of order – Child

14 February 2020

### District Judge Guy Ghazali:

## Background

1       The Plaintiff-Mother (“Mother”) and the Defendant-Father (“Father”) married on 22 October 2006 in Perth, Australia. The Father is a dual British and Hong Kong citizen while the Mother is a dual British and Malaysian citizen. Both parties are permanent residents of Singapore.

2       There is one child to the marriage, \[B\], female, born in 2007 in Perth. \[B\] is a dual Australian and British citizen. She is also a permanent resident of Singapore.

3       \[B\] has been living in Singapore since she was 2 months old.

4       The Mother filed the Writ for Divorce on 30 January 2012.

5       Interim Judgment was granted on 8 October 2012. The Interim Judgment contained, among other things, consent orders entered into by the parties in relation to \[B\].

6       I reproduce below the relevant parts of the Interim Judgment:

> _“3_.     _Further Orders Made (By Consent)_

>> (_a_)     _Custody, care and control of the child of marriage_

>> (_a)(1_)   _There shall be joint custody of the child of marriage namely \[B\], female born on xx.xx.2007 (“the said Child);_

>> (_a)(2_)   _There shall be joint care and control of the said Child with the \[Mother\] and the \[Father\] residing together with the said Child at the same premises although living separate and apart from each other;_

>> (_a)(3_)   _During such period as the parties are residing together with the said Child at the same premises, neither party shall be (sic) bring to the residence, friend of the opposite gender to such party save and except family members and relatives;_

>> (_a)(5_)   _Such joint care and control shall be implemented as follows:-_

>>> (_aa_)    _the \[Father\] shall have care and control of the said Child on Mondays through to Thursdays;_

>> (_a)(6_)   _The \[Mother\] is to be entitled to stay in the same residence until the \[Mother\] chooses to move out. in the event that the \[Mother\] and the \[Father\] are not residing on the same premises, the \[Father\] shall be liable to pay for a monthly sum of $850.00 for accommodation costs of the \[Mother\] and the said Child under such separate residence for so long as the said Child is residing in Singapore and until such times as the parties agree to send the said Child abroad for overseas studies. The \[Father\] shall bear all of the said Child’s accommodation expenses if the said Child is sent abroad for overseas studies._

>> (_a)(7_)   _Irrespective of whether the \[Mother\] and the \[Father\] together with the said Child are residing at the same premises or otherwise, the \[Father\] shall have care and control of the said Child for every Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and Boxing Day i.e. 24th, to 26th December and the \[Mother\] shall have care and control of the said Child for every festive period of Chinese New Year’s Eve through 1st and 2nd day of Chinese New Year and up to such time as the said Child’s school curriculum permits during such festive holiday period. In such respect, the \[Mother\] shall be entitled to take the said Child out of jurisdiction during such Chinese New Year festive period._

The \[Father\] shall pay for all the tertiary education expenses of the said Child.”_

7       At the time of the Interim Judgment, \[B\] was 5 years old. She is now 12 years old and has completed her Primary School Leaving Examinations (PSLE) in a local primary school.

8       In the present applications before me, both parties have sought to vary parts of the Interim Judgment.

9       Before I deal with these applications in detail, it is not disputed between the parties that after the Interim Judgment was made, the parties and \[B\] continued to reside together in the same house for a period of six years until April 2018. At this time, \[B\] was about 11 years old. Since then, \[B\] spends time at the Mother’s residence from Friday after school until Monday morning when she goes to school and at the Father’s residence from Monday after school until Friday after school, before she makes her way to the Mother’s house.

10     The two applications can be summarised as follows.

## FC/SUM 1480/2019

11     FC/SUM 1480/2019 is the Mother’s application for variation of the Interim Judgment. In her application, the Mother seeks a variation of the care and control order from joint care and control to sole care and control to her. The Mother also seeks an order that she be permitted to relocate with \[B\] to Perth, with the Father having reasonable access to \[B\]. According to the Mother’s prayers, such access arrangements are “to be agreed between the parties or otherwise to be determined by the Court”. With regard to \[B\]’s maintenance in the event of her relocation to Perth, the Mother seeks a variation of the maintenance order such that the Father shall be solely responsible for \[B\]’s maintenance including her educational and educational-related expenses.

## FC/SUM 1902/2019

12     FC/SUM 1902/2019 is the Father’s application to vary the joint care and control arrangements in the Interim Judgment such that \[B\] shall be with the Mother from Friday after 6 pm until Sunday at 6 pm, during which time the Mother shall ensure that \[B\]’s homework is attended to. \[B\] shall be with the Father for the remaining time. The Father also prays for a new clause to be added, namely that, “if \[B\] requires medical attention, the parent with care and control of \[B\] shall seek all necessary medical assistance immediately”. Additionally, the Father seeks to remove paragraphs 3(a)(3), 3(a)(4), 3(a)(6) and 3(c)(1) of the Interim Judgment. As for \[B\]’s maintenance, the Father seeks a variation of the maintenance order such that each party shall be solely liable for the costs of maintaining \[B\] during his/her care and control.

13     In arriving at my determination, I have had the opportunity of interviewing \[B\] with a court counsellor. Hence, in making my present orders, I have taken into account my observations from the child interview, in addition to the affidavits that have been filed and both Counsel’s submissions.

14     My orders on the two applications are as follows.

> (i)      FC/SUM 1480/2019 (the Mother’s application):-

>> a.       The application is dismissed.

>> b.       Each party to bear his or her own costs.

> (ii)      FC/SUM 1902/2019 (the Father’s application):-

>> a.       Paragraphs 3(a)(2) and 3(a)(5) of the Interim Judgment are varied as follows:

>>> i.       The Mother and the Father shall have shared care and control of \[B\].

>>> ii.       \[B\] shall be with the Mother from Thursday after school until Monday morning when \[B\] goes to school and with the Father from Monday after school until Thursday morning when \[B\] goes to school, provided that, on days when the Father is not in Singapore, \[B\] shall be with the Mother.

>>> iii.       Paragraphs 3(a)(3), 3(a)(4) and the first sentence of paragraph 3(a)(6) of the Interim Judgment are deleted.

>>> iv.       Save as set out above, the other terms of the Interim Judgment stand.

>> b.       The parties and \[B\] shall attend counselling at the DSSA.

>> c.       Prayers 3 and 4 of the Summons are dismissed. \[Prayer 3 relates to the variation of the joint care and control arrangement while prayer 4 relates to the variation of the maintenance order in respect of \[B\].\]

>> d.       Each party to bear his or her own costs.

15     Both parties have filed appeals against my orders in both applications although I note that the Father’s appeal in respect of FC/SUM 1480/2019 is against the cost order only.

16     I set out below the reasons for my decision.

## The Mother’s variation application for relocation and sole care and control

17     It is the Mother’s position that she should be allowed to relocate to Perth with \[B\] as she has family there. Like the Father, the Mother does not have family members in Singapore. The Mother has two younger sisters residing in Perth with their spouses and children. One sister is an Australian citizen while the other is an Australian Permanent Resident. \[B\] shares a close relationship with her cousins in Perth. \[B\]’s maternal grandmother who resides in Kuala Lumpur also travels to Perth twice or thrice a year to visit her grandchildren. \[B\] also travels to Perth during her holidays on an average of twice a year. According to the Mother, the parties have also discussed the possibility of \[B\] furthering her studies in Perth in 2017.

18     The Mother asserts that, notwithstanding the terms of the Interim Judgment, she remained \[B\]’s primary caregiver until April 2018 (six years after the Interim Judgment) when parties ceased to live together. During this time, she was physically present to care for \[B\] and attend to \[B\]’s needs. The Father, on the other hand, travelled (and continues to travel) frequently for work. He previously held a regional role when he was working in Singapore. He has been working in Hong Kong since 2018 and delegates the caregiving arrangements to his helper who has been with the family since December 2007. According to the Mother, in 2018 alone, the Father was out of Singapore for 136 days. When \[B\] is at the Father’s residence, she spends most time with the helper.

19     It is also the Mother’s contention that \[B\] has expressed her desire to live with the Mother “full-time”. Given that \[B\] is a female child who is entering adolescence, the Mother says that she is better positioned to take care of \[B\] physically, mentally and emotionally. While the Father is unable to communicate well with \[B\] and invokes fear in \[B\] due to his dictatorial parenting approach, the Mother is \[B\]’s confidante. The Mother is also involved with \[B\]’s activities such as assisting her with school work, taking her for her swimming class and attending school events.

## The Father’s variation application and response to the Mother’s application

20     According to the Father, when the parties were living together, the Mother led “a carefree lifestyle heavily biased towards her numerous personal engagements”. As a result, there were instances where the Father and the helper had to take care of \[B\] during the Mother’s care and control time with \[B\].

21     The Father maintains that he is a better parent than the Mother. He has been the sole financial provider for \[B\]. He has been actively involved in \[B\]’s life for the past 12 years, instilling “hard work and discipline” in \[B\]. The Father claims that it is only recently, when \[B\] has grown up, that the Mother is taking an interest in \[B\].

22     According to the Father, it is not in \[B\]’s best interest to relocate to Perth as she has living in Singapore since she was two months’ old, is well-adjusted to the Singapore education system, has close friends and a support structure in Singapore. If \[B\] relocates to Perth, she has to adapt to a new educational system and there is no certainty that she will do better in the Australian system compared to the Singapore system. Also, by being in Singapore, \[B\] can continue to have access to relatives from both sides of the family who are residing in Australia and the United Kingdom. Significantly, the Mother’s plan to relocate to Perth lacks proper and sufficient planning. The Mother has not secured employment in Perth, she has not stated where she will live, she has yet to secure a place in school for \[B\] and she has not set out the caregiving arrangements for \[B\] when she is at work.

23     With regard to his work travels, the Father contends that as the child’s sole financial provider, he has to meet a certain annual income. It is with this in mind that he decided to take up the job offer in Hong Kong. His role in Hong Kong is not intended to be permanent and allows him to work from home in Singapore for at least 1 week out of every 3 weeks. According to the Father, he is presently exploring roles in Singapore.

24     It is also the Father’s case that he has been actively involved in the caring of \[B\]. \[B\] is close to him and also shares her troubles with him. He supervises \[B\]’s schoolwork, ensures that her homework is completed on time and is constantly in contact with \[B\]’s teachers to seek feedback on \[B\]’s progress and development. He is also responsible in instilling discipline in \[B\] such as ensuring that she completes her homework before having her leisure time or making her way to the Mother’s residence on Friday. The Mother, on the other hand, constantly indulges \[B\] and does not put in place rules for \[B\] to follow. As for the helper, she has been a mother figure to \[B\] all these years and per the Father’s Counsel’s submissions, “the _de facto_ caregiver” for the child.

## My decision

25     Section 128 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353) allows the Court to vary any order for the custody, or the care and control, of a child on the application of any interested person, where it is satisfied that the order was based on any misrepresentation or mistake of fact or where there has been any material change in the circumstances.

26     I am satisfied that there has been a material change of circumstances since the Interim Judgment was made, in that the parties are no longer living together since April 2018. In any event, I note that both parties have applied to court to vary parts of the Interim Judgment.

27     While paragraph 3(a)(2) of the Interim Judgment contemplated for there to be joint care and control of \[B\] when the parties were both residing with \[B\], it did not provide for \[B\]’s living arrangements should parties cease to reside under the same roof. As it turned out, parties ceased residing at the same premises in April 2018. However, they have largely implemented the framework in the Interim Judgment. Under the Interim Judgment, the Mother is to have care and control of \[B\] from Thursday after school until Sunday at 6 pm. This is on the basis that all parties were residing together at the same premises. When parties started to live in different residence, \[B\] spends time at the Mother’s residence from Friday after school until Monday when she goes to school. According to the Mother, this adjustment was necessary because \[B\] had tuition at the Father’s residence on Thursday afternoons (\[B\] has since completed her PSLE).

28     In determining the present applications, I have directed my mind to the paramount consideration, which is the welfare of the child.

29     I will first deal with the Mother’s prayer for variation of the joint care and control order to sole care and control. In this regard, I note the Mother’s Counsel’s submission that the Mother intends to have sole care and control of \[B\] even if her application for relocation is not allowed. I will deal with this prayer together with the Father’s prayer to limit the Mother’s care and control time from Friday 6 pm to Sunday 6 pm.

30     In arriving at my determination, I have taken into account two significant considerations. As stated earlier, I had the benefit of interviewing the child with a court counsellor and the interview has assisted me in making certain observations.

31     The first consideration is the age of the child. At the time the Interim Judgment was made, \[B\] was five years old. She is now 12 years old. The needs of the child, in particular that of a female child, changes as she enters adolescence.

32     The second consideration is the physical absence of the Father due to his work commitments and travels. In this regard, while the Father has delegated the caregiving duties to the helper who has been with the family since \[B\] was three months’ old, I am of the view that a helper is no substitute for a parent insofar as that parent is capable of providing for the child’s needs.

33     I further take into account that \[B\] is an only child, with no sibling. At the Father’s residence, she has the Father who is often overseas and the helper. At the Mother’s residence, she has the Mother who appears to be available and accessible to \[B\] whenever \[B\] requires her. The Father has, in his affidavit, cited examples of times when the Mother was not around to care for \[B\] as she chose to prioritise her personal engagements. However, taking the Father’s position at its highest, these incidents happened years ago. For the purpose of ascertaining the arrangements that are in the best interest of the child, the court has to look at present circumstances. From the affidavit evidence and the interview with the child, I am satisfied that the Mother is capable of providing care, attention and comfort to the child and is a constant presence whom the child can readily reach out to. The child is at an age where she requires attention and time, particularly from her parents, and to be able to communicate her needs and concerns to her trusted caregivers. In this regard, I am of the view that the Mother is capable of meeting such needs. It is therefore in the best interest of the child that she spends more time with the Mother than she presently is.

34     This then begs the question as to whether the joint care and control order ought to be varied such that the Mother has sole care and control of \[B\]. I am of the view that it is important to the child that the Father continues to maintain a relationship with the child and be involved in the child’s life. The relationship between the Father and \[B\] may have evolved since she was five years old, considering that she is now older and does not see the Father as regularly as before. There appear to be communication challenges between the Father and the child, as expressed by the child. However, I note that even though the Father travels significantly, he is an involved and participatory parent and cannot be said to be an absent parent. He is actively involved in the child’s education and school affairs and even when he could not attend to the physical caregiving of the child, he would delegate the supervision of the child to the helper. As such, I am of the view that is important for the relationship between the Father and \[B\] to be maintained, preserved and nurtured. It would also be beneficial to the father-child relationship if the Father could spend more quality time with the child when he is in Singapore and to endeavour to better understand the child’s emotional needs even though this court acknowledges that he has been striving to meet the child’s financial and educational needs.

35     In the circumstances, I am of the view that it is in \[B\]’s best interest for the shared care and control order to remain with the parents having almost equal time to \[B\] (i.e. three days with the Father and four days with the Mother). If the Father is not in Singapore on his allocated days with the child, \[B\] shall be with the Mother on these days.

36     It follows from the above that the Mother’s prayer for relocation is disallowed as the relocation prayer is premised on the Mother having sole care and control of \[B\]. Be that as it may, while the Mother’s wish to relocate cannot be said to be unreasonable, it is evident that there is no proper plan in place, not just in terms of the child’s access to the Father, but also the living, schooling and caregiving arrangements of the child.

37     Taking the above factors into consideration, I am of the view that it is in the best interest of the child:

> i.     for parties to continue to have joint care and control of the child in that the parties shall have shared care and control of the child;

> ii.     the Mother shall have time with the child from Thursday after school until Monday morning when the child goes to school;

> iii.     the Father shall have time with the child from Monday after school until Thursday morning when the child goes to school;

> iv.     in the event that the Father is not in Singapore during his time with the child, the child shall be with the Mother.

38     I am also directing for the parties and the child to attend counselling at the Divorce Support Specialist Agency (“DSSA”) to assist them to co-parent more effectively and where required, to understand the child’s present needs better.

39     In the interest of completeness, I note that the Father has sought an additional provision that the Mother shall ensure that the child’s homework is attended to. Given the child’s age and that she will be entering secondary school, I am of the view that this provision is not necessary as she will be able to manage her homework herself. The Father has also prayed for an order that requires the parent with care and control to seek all necessary medical assistance immediately if the child requires medical attention. I have no reason to believe that the parents will not seek medical attention for the child if the child so requires, as I am satisfied that they both care sufficiently for the child to be able to attend to the child’s needs including and in particular her medical needs. As such, I am not minded to include a clause that is not necessary in the circumstances.

40     As for the Father’s prayers for the variation of maintenance, he has sought for the removal of the clause in the Interim Judgment that requires him to pay the Mother $850 per month “for accommodation costs for the \[Mother\] and \[B\] under such separate residence \[in the event that the parties are not residing on the same premises\] for so long as \[B\] is residing in Singapore..”. The Father has also prayed for a variation of the maintenance order in the Interim Judgment that requires him to be solely liable for all the maintenance expenses of \[B\]. The Father instead requests that each party be liable for the costs of maintaining \[B\] during the period when \[B\] is in their respective care and control.

41     I have not allowed the Father’s prayers for variation of the maintenance orders. I am of the view that the Interim Judgment has sufficiently provided for the scenario where the parties are no longer living together in the same residence and the financial provisions that will be made by the Father in such eventuality. There has also been no material change of circumstances that warrants a variation of these orders.

## Costs

42     The Father’s Counsel submits costs of $4,000 on the basis that the Mother’s application for relocation has not been allowed. The Mother’s Counsel argues that there should be no order as to costs but if this court is minded to order costs, costs should not exceed $3,000.

43     In determining costs, I do not view the two applications as separate but as related applications that were heard together with issues and facts interlinked. While I note that the Mother has not been successful in her application, it cannot be said that the Father has been successful in his application given that the Mother will now have more time with \[B\] under my present order compared to the amount of time that she has previously enjoyed or the amount of time that the Father has sought for in his application.

44     In the circumstances, I am of the view that it is appropriate for each party to bears his or her own costs for the two applications.
