Rescission of maintenance order

25 October 2019

### District Judge Guy Ghazali:

## Introduction

1       This is an application by the Complainant-Husband (“the Husband”) for rescission of the maintenance order dated 19 December 2017 (“the 19 December 2017 Order”).

2       The 19 December 2017 Order was entered into by the consent of the parties and was a variation of maintenance order made under section 72 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353), pursuant to an application made by the Wife (who is the Respondent in the present application).

3       Based on the court records, the history of the maintenance orders made by the court involving both parties can be summarised as follows:

> a.     Pursuant to a maintenance application by the Wife under section 69 of the Women’s Charter, parties entered into a consent maintenance order on 18 June 2014 (“the 18 June 2014 Order”). Under the 18 June 2014 Order, the Husband was to pay the Wife a sum of $300.00 per month for the Wife’s maintenance with effect from 30 June 2014 and thereafter on the 10th day of each month.

> b.     The 18 June 2014 Order was subsequently varied by the consent of the parties on 3 August 2017 (“the 3 August 2017 Order”). Under the 3 August 2017 Order, the maintenance amount increased from $300.00 per month to $400.00 per month, payable on the 10th day of each month with effect from 10 August 2017. Additionally, the 3 August 2017 Order stipulated that the maintenance amount would increase to $500.00 per month with effect from 10 January 2018.

> c.     Thereafter, parties entered into a further consent order on 19 December 2017 (“the 19 December 2017 Order”) in which the date of payment was varied from the 10th day of the month to the 3rd day of the month, commencing 3 January 2018. However, there was no change to the maintenance amount, which remained at $500.00 per month (with effect from January 2018).

4       As stated at \[1\], the 19 December 2017 Order is the subject of the present application by the Husband for rescission. By his rescission application, the Husband is seeking a revocation or a cancellation of the 19 December 2017 Order. The Husband is not seeking a downward variation or a reduction in the payment amount. The effect of a rescission order is that the Husband will no longer be liable to pay any maintenance to the Wife.

## The Husband’s reasons for the present application for rescission

5       In the Husband’s complaint dated 15 May 2019, the Husband provided three reasons to support his application for rescission of the 19 December 2017 Order:

> a.     First, that he would cease employment on 2 June 2019.

> b.     Secondly, that he was unable to work due to “body pain” and his age (62 years).

> c.     Thirdly, that the Wife was financially supported by her adult child. (It is not clear whether the said child is a child of the marriage or the Wife’s child.)

## The facts

6       Both parties are 62 years old.

7       Based on parties’ oral testimony and the documentary evidence before the court, the facts can be summarised as follow:

> a.     At the time of the making of the 19 December 2017 Order, the Husband was working in the hospitality industry at a five-star hotel in Singapore, earning a gross income of $2,100 per month and a take-home income of about $1,900 per month.

> b.     On 1 April 2019, the Husband tendered his resignation.[^1]

> c.     On 4 April 2019, the Husband’s employer accepted his resignation.[^2] The Husband’s last working day was 31 May 2019.[^3]

> d.     By June 2019, the Husband had resumed working at the same hotel but on a part-time basis. It was the Husband’s oral testimony that his part-time work involved him working for “sometimes 8 hours, sometimes 9½ hours” for “2, 3 or 4 days in 1 week”.[^4] The Husband’s pay slips for June 2019 reflected the Husband’s work department as “room-housekeeping”.[^5] When asked about the scope of his present work, the Husband informed the court that his work involved him being in the linen room to “hang the clothes”.[^6] When he was in full-time employment, he was “in charge of the minibar” in the hotel rooms.[^7] For completeness, I would add that the Husband also indicated at the trial of this matter that he was working “on a part-time basis as a cashier”.[^8] It is not clear if this job is supplemental to his part-time employment in the hotel as there is no document or evidence on this.

> e.     The Husband’s abovementioned pay slips for June 2019 showed that he was paid $7.50 per hour for his part-time employment. Based on his pay slips, the Husband earned a total net income of $209.41 for the period from 1 June 2019 to 15 June 2019 (for 27.92 hours of work) and a total net income of $342.55 for the period from 16 June 2019 to 30 June 2019 (for a total 45.67 hours of work). This worked out to a total net income of $551.96 for the month of June 2019. The Husband worked for about 73 to 74 hours or roughly about 9 days in June 2019 (based on the Husband’s evidence on the average number of hours he worked per working day).

## The Husband’s case at the trial of this matter

8       It is the Husband’s case that he is not earning enough to cover his own expenses with income received from his part-time employment.

9       When he was asked why he had resigned from full-time employment, only to work part-time at the same hotel, the Husband replied that his previous role was “tough” and he had to do more work.[^9]

10     In the Husband’s list of expenses, the Husband has set out his monthly expenses as $860.00 per month. A breakdown of these expenses is set out below:[^10]

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="78.92%"> <col width="21.08%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Items (as provided for in the court’s list of expenses sheet)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Amount</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Telephone</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$110.00</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Eating out</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$450.00</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Cigarette/Alcohol</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$250.00</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Public transport</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$ 50.00</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Total</b></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>$860.00</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

11     In addition to the above expenses, the Husband has also included an expense item for credit card repayment in the sum of $179.00 per month.

12     It is also the Husband’s case that the Wife has a 29-year old son who is earning $2,700 a month and capable of supporting her.[^11]

## The Wife’s position

13     The Wife disagrees with the Husband’s application for a rescission of the 19 December 2017 Order. It is the Wife’s position that she is “half-paralysed” and is therefore unable to work (the court notes that she attended the hearing in a wheelchair).[^12]

14     According to the Wife, she relies on financial support from her son. Her son buys her food and gives her money if she does not have enough.[^13]

15     The Wife’s list of expenses is as follows:[^14]

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="78.9%"> <col width="21.1%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Items (as provided for in the court’s list of expenses sheet)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Amount</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Telephone</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$ 50.00</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Electricity / Water / Gas</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$150.00</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Conservancy charges</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$ 30.00</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Food / Groceries</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$100.00</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Eating out</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$ 300.00</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Clothing</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$ 20.00</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Cigarette / Alcohol</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$100.00</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Public transport</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$ 50.00</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Total</b></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>$800.00</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

16     The Wife further claims that her son is also supporting his maternal grandmother who is in her eighties. According to the Wife, as her son does not have enough money for his own spending, he has to take loans and make repayment for the loans. In addition, her son’s company is in the midst of retrenching staff.[^15]

## My decision

17     Section 72 of the Women’s Charter allows the court to rescind a maintenance order on, among other things, proof of a change of circumstances on the part of the person ordered to pay maintenance (in this case, the Husband).

18     In the present case, it is apparent to this court that there has been a change of circumstances on the part of the Husband, insofar as his income is concerned. However, a change of circumstances does not automatically result in a rescission of an order of court. The court must be satisfied that the change of circumstances justifies a rescission of the order.

19     In ascertaining whether there is ground for rescission, the court has to assess the circumstances leading to the change of the Husband’s circumstances.

20     When the complaint was filed by the Husband in May 2019, the primary reason relied on by the Husband was that he was going to cease employment.

21     However, as matters turned out, the Husband continued to work with the same employer, albeit on a part-time basis.

22     With regard to his resignation, the Husband has not provided a satisfactory explanation as to why he resigned from full-time employment. The only reason provided by the Husband was that the work was “tough”. It is noted that the Husband resigned voluntarily from his job. He was not terminated by his employer or retrenched from his job.

23     There is also no medical report to show that the Husband is only capable of working on a reduced number of days or hours basis. Even for his part-time employment, the Husband’s testimony is that he works between 8 and 9.5 hours per working day. The number of working days however varies from two to four days a week.

24     Even if we apply the Husband’s income from his part-time employment, I am of the view that the Husband has the ability to earn more, considering that he worked for only about 73 to 74 hours (or about 9 days) in one month, based on his June 2019 pay slips. However, this still does not resolve the question as to why the Husband needed to switch to part-time employment. In the Husband’s complaint, the Husband claims that he is unable to work (presumably on a full-time basis) due to “body pain”. Again, the Husband has not provided evidence to show that he is suffering from any medical condition that renders him incapable or unfit to work on a full-time basis (bearing in mind that he continues to work fairly long hours in his present part-time employment).

25     As for the Husband’s contention that the Wife’s son can maintain the Wife, I note that the Wife’s son was already a working adult when the 19 December 2017 Order was made. Further, it would appear that the $500 maintenance amount forms only part (and not all) of the Wife’s expenses. Based on the Wife’s expenses and her oral testimony, it would appear that her son is already assisting to supplement her expenses given that she is no longer able to work.

26     In the circumstances, I am not satisfied that there is satisfactory ground for rescission of the 19 December 2017 Order and I accordingly dismiss the Husband’s application for rescission.
