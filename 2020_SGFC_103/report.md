Division of Matrimonial Assets – Variation of Order

21 December 2020

### District Judge Adriene Cheong:

1       This judgment deals with cross-applications to vary a consent Order in relation to the division of the matrimonial assets. I heard oral submissions on 13 August 2020 and reserved my decision pending further information from parties. I subsequently informed parties of my decision by Registrar’s Notice on 1 September 2020 with accompanying brief reasons; and a subsequent decision on 29 September 2020 on the outstanding issue of costs. The Defendant has filed an appeal against the entirety of my decision and I now provide my reasons in full.

## Introduction

2       The cross-applications revolved around the regulation of parties’ conduct to enforce the terms of a consent Order entered into in January 2019 relating to a property in Singapore (“Singapore property”) and a property in the Philippines (“Philippines property”) which remained unresolved.

## Facts

### The parties

3       Parties were married in December 2013. In June 2018, the Plaintiff/Husband (“the Husband”) commenced the Writ for divorce. The Interim Judgment was granted in January 2019 dissolving the marriage where parties’ agreement on the majority of the outstanding issues was similarly recorded in the Interim Judgment (“the Consent IJ”). Parties subsequently entered into a further Consent Order in August 2019 on the remaining terms. The Final Judgment was extracted in September 2019.

4       The portions of the Consent IJ that are relevant to the current dispute are Clauses 1a and 1b:

> (a)     Relating to the Singapore property: the Husband was to pay the Wife a sum of $27,500 (being the agreed value equivalent to 5% of the prevailing market value of the Singapore property) by 30 March 2020 (i.e. 6 months from the Final Judgment);

> (b)     Relating to the Philippines property: the Husband was to sell the property and pay the Wife 50% of the net proceeds of sale by 30 March 2020 (i.e. 6 months from Final Judgment).

### Background to the dispute

5       It is undisputed that the Husband is the sole owner of both properties in Singapore and the Philippines.

6       Pursuant to the terms of the Consent IJ, the Husband was to complete the 2 obligations relating to the properties within 6 months from the date of Final Judgment, i.e. by 30 March 2020. This is also undisputed.

7       It is further undisputed that at the time the applications were filed, and when the matter was heard in August 2020, these obligations remained pending. In other words, the Philippines property had not yet been sold and the Wife had not received the sums due to her for both the Singapore and the Philippines properties.

## The parties’ cases

8       In June 2020, the Husband commenced the variation application seeking adjustments to the Consent IJ to facilitate the sale of the Philippines property.

9       The Wife filed her application the following day after the Husband’s application was served on her through her solicitors.

10     She sought adjustments to the Consent IJ for an extension of time for the sale of the Philippines property and for a penal notice to be inserted. She was of the view that the Husband was intentionally delaying the payment of the sums due to her.

11     The Husband perceived that the Wife had obstructed the sale of the Philippines property and sought orders to remedy this. He also asserted that he faced financial difficulties and sought an adjustment to allow him to pay the sum of S$27,500 (“the Sum”) due to the Wife for the Singapore property through monies in his Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) account instead of in cash.

12     After consideration, I made the following Orders:

> (a)     That Clause 1b of the Order of 21 February 2019 be varied to read as follows:

>> (i)       The sum of S$27,500 (being the agreed value equivalent to 5% of the prevailing market value of the matrimonial flat located at \[Singapore Property\] shall be paid by the Husband to the Wife in cash within 7 days of the date of the completion of sale of the property referred to at paragraph 1c of the Order.

> (b)     That Clause 1c of the Order dated 21 February 2019 be varied to read as follows:

>> (i)       The Husband’s condominium unit situated at \[Philippines Property\], shall be sold in the open market within 6 months of the date of this Order. 50% of the net proceeds of sale (defined as sale proceeds less any necessary costs and expenses related to the sale of the property) shall be paid by the Husband to the Wife within 7 days from the completion of the sale.

>> (ii)       The Husband shall have sole conduct of sale.

>> (iii)       The Husband shall be at liberty to elect, within 7 days of this Order (a) for the Wife to provide the Husband’s appointed agent with a set of keys to the property within 7 days of the Husband’s election, or (b) for the Wife to provide the Husband with a set of keys to the property within 21 days of the Husband’s election.

>> (iv)       Apart from the above, each party shall retain their own assets in their respective names. (_no change from the original terms of the IJ_)

## Issues to be determined

13     Given the cross-applications by parties, there were several distinct but related issues involved. The focus will be on issues of relevance to the Appeal as filed by the Wife. I will deal briefly with the other issues that are unlikely to be relevant for the purposes of the present Appeal by the Wife.

14     The issues for determination were:

> (a)     The timing and manner of payment of the Sum by the Husband to the Wife;

> (b)     The terms of vacant possession of the Philippines property;

> (c)     Whether a Penal Notice should be inserted;

> (d)     Whether the Orders should be set aside or varied due to the Wife’s conduct;

> (e)     Costs.

## Issue 1: Timing and manner of payment of the Sum

15     Whilst parties agreed on the quantum of S$27,500 that represented the 5% as provided for at Clause 1a of the Consent IJ, they disagreed on when and how it should be paid.

16     The Husband sought to vary the terms of the Consent IJ to allow for him to utilise monies in his CPF account to make this payment, citing cashflow issues. The Wife objected to this, referring to the terminology of the Consent IJ, which reflected a cash payment[^2].

17     The Husband agreed that it was parties’ original intention for it to be paid by cash but sought a variation by reason of the material change in his cash position due to a significant reduction of his income[^3]. He also made reference to the linked issue that the timing of the payment to the Wife should be tagged to the completion of the sale of the Philippines property[^4]. The Wife maintained that Clauses 1a and 1b of the Consent IJ were independent of each other and no references were made to suggest that they were dependent[^5]. She asked for an immediate payment of the Sum due to her.

18     On this issue, I found no reason to disturb the original intent of parties, that the Sum was to be paid by the Husband to the Wife _in cash_. If parties had intended for the sum to be paid through monies in the Husband’s CPF account, there would have been the corresponding supplemental Orders relating to the transfer of funds in line with the applicable CPF Rules and Regulations, which were absent. In fact, I observed that no reference was made to CPF at all in the relevant clauses contained in the Consent IJ.

19     However, I found that it was parties’ intention that the timing of the cash payment was to be made in or around the same time when the Philippines property was sold. If not concurrently, then at least consecutively. This was because the time frame for both obligations pursuant to Clauses 1a and 1b of the Consent IJ were listed _identically_ as 6 months from the date of Final Judgment, i.e. by 30 March 2020. In my view, if parties had strictly complied with the terms of the Consent IJ, the Philippines property would have been sold or close to completion of a sale, at the point of time where the Husband’s obligation to pay the Sum to the Wife became due. Even though I accept that the obligations were not specifically linked or worded to be dependent on each other, the stated timelines for both obligations were clearly aligned in the Consent IJ. I saw no reason to depart from parties’ original intention and given that both parties had not complied with the original terms of the Consent IJ and adjusted the Orders to reflect this.

20     I found the Wife’s concern that the Husband would potentially delay the sale of the condominium[^6] if the payment was linked to the sale to be speculative at best and equivocal, in light of the fact that the Wife’s continued exclusive occupation of the property (through her family members) that she averred remained until the property was sold, and had asserted her alleged right as a co-owner of the conjugal property pursuant to the laws of Philippines[^7].

21     At this juncture, I would elaborate on a submission made by the Wife, that the Consent IJ should not have been varied as the situation did not cross the threshold as envisioned by the seminal Court of Appeal case of _AYM v AYM <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGCA 68</span>_, read with _TYA v TYB <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHCF 29</span>_.

22     At first blush, I found this submission to be an odd position to adopt in defending the Husband’s variation, given that the Wife herself had filed her own variation application, seeking adjustments to the Consent IJ. If I had accepted her submissions that the threshold for variation had not been crossed, it would logically follow that her own variation would have to fail in the circumstances.

23     Regardless, I was satisfied the situation warranted the Court’s intervention, not only to provide fresh timelines for parties to fulfil their respective obligations but also to regulate their conduct to bring the matter to a close.

24     A final observation on this point. At its lowest, the Order was unworkable as the Order-prescribed timelines had expired and had to be renewed in the least. The Orders remained pending and parties were in deadlock. Accordingly, I was satisfied of the need for the Court to intervene and regulate parties to give effect to their original intentions as stated in the Consent IJ.

25     I was of the view that the respective payments should be made within 7 days of the date of completion of the sale of the condominium, to provide for any administrative issues to be resolved, and I therefore so ordered.

## Issue 2: The terms of vacant possession of the Philippines property

26     The Husband sought orders for vacant possession of the Philippines property, in light of the hurdles he had faced due to the Wife’s conduct.

27     The Philippines property was purchased by the Husband in July 2015 as an investment and shortly after, the Husband agreed to the Wife’s request for her relatives to reside there on a temporary basis[^8]. The Wife stated that the Husband was aware of the situation and did not raise the issue of her relatives vacating the property during the course of negotiating the terms of the Consent IJ, and accordingly, her relatives could continue to reside in the property until it was sold[^9].

28     It was not disputed through the affidavits, that the Wife continued to have exclusive possession to the Philippines property through the occupation by her relatives. There was no dispute that the Husband had no real access to the Philippines property that was in his sole name as the keys to the property were not in the Husband’s or his appointed agent’s possession[^10]. There was some dispute on the surrounding context, but nothing turns on this. The Husband stated he did not have true access and he was not able to market the Philippines property for sale due to the Wife’s obstructive conduct. The Wife maintained that vacant possession was not necessary for the sale, and would not impact his ability to market the property for sale and that he was simply delaying the payments due to her[^11].

29     Through the affidavits and submissions, the Wife reiterated that the Philippines property had always been occupied by her relatives shortly after purchase and the Husband was fully aware of this when the Consent IJ was granted. Flowing from this, the Wife asserts there were no obligations for vacant possession until the completion of the sale[^12]; or that the situation did not warrant any variation as there were no material change of circumstances[^13]. I found this position hard to accept as whilst the Consent IJ does not provide specifically for vacant possession of the property, it expressly provided for the sale of the Philippines property. This necessarily would entail vacant possession of the property at some point.

30     During the course of the hearing, it transpired through counsel, that the Wife had informed the Husband through a phone call that the Philippines property had been vacated but the keys were not yet handed over to him[^14]. As this event was unaffirmed by either party, I therefore directed for affidavits to be filed on this recent development.

31     The subsequent affidavits confirmed the Philippines property had been vacated by the Wife’s relatives, but that the keys had not been handed over. I found this situation to be an unsatisfactory one, given that this property was in the Husband’s sole name and the legal obligation to sell the property naturally rested with him. I therefore found it necessary to regulate the situation with specificity. I pause to observe that the Wife’s counsel similarly accepted, during oral arguments, that since the Husband was the sole legal owner, he was the only one who had to sign the documents[^15].

32     In this application, the Husband sought for the keys to be delivered to him and/or his agent in the Philippines, personally by the Wife[^16]. The Wife submitted that the keys could be given directly to his appointed agent in the Philippines, but instructed that she would similarly retain a set and would like to reside in the property with their daughter should the opportunity arise that she is in the Philippines and the property has not yet been sold[^17]. I note there were consequential disputes between the parties on the issue of the handover of the keys included in the supplemental affidavits[^18], but it had no bearing on my decision.

33     Considering that the property belonged to the Husband and that he was the one who had to fulfil the legal obligation to sell the property, I allowed the Husband the choice to elect if he preferred to have the keys handed over to his appointed agent in Philippines or to him directly in Singapore. To avoid further disputes, I provided for specific time frames for the keys to be delivered depending on which option the Husband elected. If it was to be given to the appointed agent in the Philippines, I was of the view that 7 days was sufficient. If the keys were to be given to him in Singapore, I provided for 21 days for the necessary logistical aspects to be addressed.

34     For avoidance of doubt, I found that there was no need to make any specific finding on the Wife’s alleged obstructive conduct in arriving at my decision and declined to do so.

## Issue 3: Whether a Penal Notice should be inserted

35     The Wife sought the insertion of a Penal Notice in the Order.

36     Her view was that it would “ensure implementation”[^19] and “would serve as a poignant reminder to parties to treat the orders with utmost sacrosanct”[^20].

37     The Husband’s position was it was unnecessary as he was serious about complying with the terms of the Consent IJ but was not able to due to the Wife’s conduct[^21].

38     Considering the situation holistically, I declined to insert a Penal Notice. In my view, all Court Orders are sacrosanct and are to be complied with. In this particular case, both parties were clearly aware of their legal obligations and had pursued litigation to fulfil their respective positions through counsel. I found that there was no need to remind parties of the obligations pursuant to the Order.

39     Further, I took into consideration that parties were in fact able to reach a consensus and entered into Orders by consent on 2 separate prior occasions and this was the first ‘dispute’ between them. In my view, this was not a case where either party or parties acted in repeated or wilful breach of the Orders.

40     I bear in mind that following the cases of _UNE v UNF <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHCF 15</span>_ and _URU v URV <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHCF 22</span>_, the Wife (or the Husband, if he so wished) remained at liberty to endorse the Order with the Penal Notice. This would not prejudice either party’s future application for committal proceedings against the other (if any). Should the Wife persist in her view that the Husband required ‘reminding’, she remained at liberty to endorse the order with a Penal Notice prior to service.

## Issue 4: Whether the Orders should be set aside or varied due to the Wife’s conduct

41     The rest of the issues related to the Husband’s application and are unlikely relevant for the present appeal. For completeness’ sake, I deal with these issues briefly.

42     The Husband had sought a variation of the Consent IJ due to what he asserted as the Wife’s conduct in frustrating the sale of the Philippines property. He sought:

> (a)     For the Consent IJ to be set aside due to the Wife’s subsequent conduct in obstructing the sale of the Philippines property[^22].

> (b)     To be accorded rent or some form of financial compensation for the Wife’s continued use of the Philippines property (through her relatives).

> (c)     To reduce the payments due to the Wife in light of the Wife’s conduct and prolonged rent-free occupation (with reference to Section 112(2f) of the Women’s Charter.

43     On the claim to set aside the Consent IJ, the Husband stressed that this was to reflect the Wife’s subsequent conduct in thwarting the sale of the Philippines property, by facilitating her relatives’ continued possession of the same. I found this alone to be insufficient to meet the settled threshold for the Orders to be set aside.

44     On the point of payment of rent or financial compensation, the Husband’s counsel rightly accepted that the issue was not contemplated within the agreed terms of the Consent IJ, where it was undisputed that the Husband was aware that the Wife’s relatives were residing in the Philippines property long before the Consent IJ was entered into. Had any form of rent or financial compensation been contemplated by the parties, it would have certainly been included as terms in the Consent IJ.

45     Referencing my observation of the Wife’s position on variation of the terms of the Consent IJ in paragraph 21 above, I concluded that the situation did not warrant or justify any variation of the Consent IJ in terms of any reduction in the payments due to the Wife. The law is clear on this and the power to vary is limited to the workability of the terms of the order, to which I have addressed with my adjustments.

## Issue 5: Costs

46     Although neither party had obtained an Order-in-terms of their respective applications, I accepted that Court intervention was necessary in this case. In my decision of 1 September 2020, I invited parties to submit brief submission on costs if they were pursuing the issue.

47     The Husband sought costs of $5,000 on the basis that I had agreed with his position on the timing of the payment of the Sum was to be pegged to the sale of the Philippines property and made further references to the Wife’s conduct in necessitating the litigation.

48     The Wife sought costs of $4,500 on the basis that I had agreed with her position on the payment of the Sum to be made in cash and did not agree with the Husband’s requests for it to be paid through monies from his CPF account, or his other requests for financial compensation, rent and others.

49     Having considered the matter, I decided that it would be an appropriate case for each party to bear their own costs. Neither party had fully succeeded in their respective applications, but both had succeeded in some part. It was my view that both were to be responsible for the situation that necessitated Court intervention and I declined to make any party bear the costs of the application in reflection of this finding.

## Postscript: Further Arguments

50     For completeness, the Wife’s counsel submitted a Request for Further Arguments on 4 September 2020 which was declined on 8 September 2020. I was of the view that the Further Arguments listed in the Request had already been dealt with through written and oral submissions and declined a further audience with parties, with a reference to the above-cited case authorities in relation to the insertion of the Penal Notice.

## Conclusion

51     Parties’ obvious distrust of each other was disheartening to witness. It was a pity that parties who were previously able to agree on a global resolution of all ancillary matters barely a year ago, subsequently were unable or unwilling to facilitate the mechanics and implementation of the agreed terms.

52     It is my hope that with the adjustments made to bring the matter to a close, parties are finally able to put this dispute behind them and move on.
