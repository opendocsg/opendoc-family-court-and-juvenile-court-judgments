Family law – Maintenance – Wife – Child

21 April 2021

### District Judge Darryl Soh:

## Introduction

1       This matter concerns an application by the Plaintiff-Wife (“Wife”) against the Defendant-Husband (“Husband”) (collectively referred to as the “Parties”) for interim wife and child maintenance. The broad issue was whether the maintenance the Husband currently provides is adequate. At the conclusion of the hearing, I found that it was inadequate in the circumstances of this case and I ordered the Husband to pay interim maintenance for both the Wife and their child. The Husband has filed an appeal against my decision. In these grounds, I explain my decision in detail.

## Background Facts and MSS 2341/2020

2       The Parties were married in May 2005 in India. They are both Indian citizens and Singapore Permanent Residents. They have one child, a seven-year-old daughter (“Child”) who is diagnosed with speech impediment and developmental delays. She attends multiple therapy sessions each week, in addition to the international school she attends in Singapore. The Parties are both university graduates and are in their 40s. The Husband is a senior manager in an investment firm earning approximately half a million annually. The Wife has been a homemaker and full-time caregiver of the Child since June 2016 when her employment contract ended. Prior to that, she was a recruitment specialist and her last drawn salary was $9,100.00 monthly. She averred that she did not continue her employment because the Husband suggested that she could stay at home to care for the Child and that the Child requires round-the-clock care.

3       Prior to the breakdown of their relationship, the Parties resided in a rented apartment in central Singapore. On 17 July 2020, the Husband moved out of the apartment. The Husband averred that he thereafter provides maintenance of approximately $12,500.00 monthly.[^1] This includes $2,000.00 cash monthly for the Wife and the Child’s monthly expenses intended to cover their groceries, transport, and other miscellaneous items. The remaining maintenance comprises the following of their expenses which the Husband pays for directly:

> (a)     Monthly rent of $4,500.00 for their rented apartment;

> (b)     Monthly utilities for their rented apartment amounting to around $400.00;

> (c)     The Child’s school fees amounting to $2,400.00 monthly;[^2] and

> (d)     The Child’s therapy fees amounting to $3,200.00 monthly.

4       The Wife filed an application for interim maintenance pursuant to ss. 69(1) and (2) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“Women’s Charter”) on 15 September 2020 _vide_ MSS 2341/2020. In her application, she affirmed that the Husband has either neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for her and the Child since 17 July 2020, and she prayed for the Husband to pay maintenance of $4,500.00 monthly, comprising $1,250.00 for herself, and $3,250.00 for the Child.

5       On 23 October 2020, the Wife commenced divorce proceedings against the Husband _vide_ FC/D XXX/2020. Shortly thereafter, the Husband filed an application for a personal protection order against the Wife _vide_ SS XXX3/2020. The Wife similarly filed an application for a personal protection order against the Husband _vide_ SS XXX2/2020. The Wife refers to the discord in the Parties’ marriage and family violence allegations with some particularity in her Written Submissions for her present interim maintenance application. The Husband made similar allegations of family violence in his affidavit filed in the Wife’s application. I do not find a need to address them in my grounds of decision other than observing that those particulars are irrelevant to the merits of MSS 2341/2020.

6       The Parties agreed for MSS 2341/2020 to be dealt with by way of affidavit evidence instead of a trial. Each filed a single affidavit[^3] and the hearing took place on 10 February 2021.

## Orders Made

7       At the conclusion of the hearing, I ordered the Husband to make the following interim maintenance payments for the Wife and the Child:[^4]

> (a)     $12,000.00 in backdated maintenance for the period of September 2020 to February 2021;

> (b)     $4,000.00 each month for the months of March and April 2021;

> (c)     $2,100.00 each month commencing 1 May 2021 and thereafter on or before every 1st day of each month; and

> (d)     Continued payment of the rental of the Wife and the Child’s apartment capped at $4,500.00 per month, their apartment’s utilities, the Child’s school and school-related fees, and the Child’s therapy fees. Any expenses incurred in addition to the above shall be paid by the Wife commencing 1 May 2021.

8       The Husband filed an appeal on 16 February 2021 against the whole of my decision.

## Wife’s Case

9       In contrast to what the Wife applied for at the time of making the application (_i.e_. \[4\] above), the Wife prayed in her Written Submissions for the following extensive and substantial maintenance orders to be made in her favour:[^5]

> (a)     The Husband shall reimburse the Wife $26,100.00, being the total arrears of maintenance owed to the Wife and the Child for 6 months from 17 July 2020 to 17 January 2021. This sum is calculated by deducting the Husband’s monthly payments of S$2,000.00 from the Wife’s and the Child’s monthly expenses of $6,350.00;

> (b)     With effect from 1 February 2021 and thereafter on the 1st day of each calendar month, the Husband shall pay to the Wife the sum of $2,550.00 monthly as maintenance for the Wife pending the grant of the Final Judgment for Divorce;

> (c)     With effect from 1 February 2021 and thereafter on the 1st day of each calendar month, the Husband shall pay to the Wife the sum of $3,800.00 as maintenance for the Child pending the grant of the Final Judgment for Divorce;

> (d)     The Husband shall pay the following expenses of the Child directly to the service providers. If the Wife has paid for these expenses first, the Husband shall reimburse the Wife within seven days of receiving the receipt from the Wife:

>> (i)       School fees (including tertiary / university education fees);

>> (ii)       All school-mandated excursion and trips, local or overseas, enrichment classes and equipment (including but not limited to sports equipment or technology related equipment), provided always that it remains open to the Child to enrol in optional education related courses or events (_e.g._ Overseas Learning Journey) to be agreed between Parties, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld;

>> (iii)       The Child’s year-end school expenses (such as school uniforms, school shoes, school books, excursion fees and any fees that the school requires, including but not limited to donation drives);

>> (iv)       Any medical, dental, orthodontic and optical expenses (including medical fees incurred at GP clinics as well as specialist treatment);

>> (v)       The Child’s therapy fees, including fees for any additional therapy sessions as agreed between the Parties, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld;

>> (vi)       Tuition and enrichment related expenses as agreed between the Parties, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld;

>> (vii)       The Child’s existing insurance policies that are currently paid by the Husband, if any; and

>> (viii)       Any insurance policies procured for the Child as agreed between the Parties, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld;

> (e)     The Husband shall pay the following household expenses directly to the service providers. If the Wife has paid for these expenses first, the Husband shall reimburse the Wife within seven days of receiving the receipt from the Wife:

>> (i)       The Wife and the Child’s rent;

>> (ii)       Utilities (electricity, water and gas);

>> (iii)       Telephone, cable TV and Internet;

>> (iv)       Condominium management fees, maintenance charges and property tax;

>> (v)       Air-conditioner maintenance;

>> (vi)       Expenses relating to the repair and / or maintenance works for the Wife’s and the Child’s place of residence as agreed between the Parties, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld; and

>> (vii)       Expenses relating to the repair and / or replacement of home appliances and furniture at the Wife’s and the Child’s place of residence.

10     In particular, the Wife submitted that the existing cash maintenance of $2,000.00 provided by the Husband for her and the Child was inadequate. In support, she averred that she and the Child incurred the following monthly expenses:

> **Wife’s Personal Monthly Expenses**

> 1.     Eating out $250.00

> 2.     Clothing $100.00

> 3.     Medical $100.00

> 4.     Public transport $200.00

> 5.     Tour and family outings $100.00

> 6.     Vitamins and supplements $200.00

> 7.     Haircut $200.00

> 8.     Miscellaneous $200.00

> 9.     Share of monthly household expenses $1,200.00\*

> Total = $2,550.00

> **Child’s Personal Monthly Expenses**

> 1.     Clothing / shoes $100.00

> 2.     Eating out $250.00

> 3.     School expenses (books / stationery) $100.00

> 4.     Transport $700.00

> 10.     Toiletries $70.00

> 11.     Health supplements / vitamins $100.00

> 12.     Toys / storybooks $100.00

> 13.     Share of monthly household expenses $1,200.00\*

> Total = $3,800.00

> **\* Monthly Household Expenses**

> 1.     Food or groceries $1,300.00

> 2.     Domestic helper’s salary, levy, transport, and expenses $1,100.00

> Total = $2,400.00

## Husband’s Case

11     The Husband submitted that the Wife’s application for interim maintenance should be dismissed in its entirety as he neither neglected nor provided inadequate maintenance for the Wife or the Child. In summary, he advanced the following arguments in his Written Submissions:

> (a)     The Wife admitted that the Husband has not neglected to maintain her or the Child;

> (b)     The Wife has not made out her claim that her monthly expenses amount to $2,500.00. The documents in the Wife’s Affidavit show that her expenses amount to approximately $884.00;

> (c)     The Wife has substantial financial resources within her reach;

> (d)     The Wife should seek gainful employment as she has the capacity to do so; and

> (e)     The Wife has not made out her claim that the Child’s monthly expenses amount to $3,800.00.

## Decision

12     The broad issue before the court was whether the maintenance the Husband currently provides (_i.e._ at \[3\]) is adequate. The Wife submitted that it was insufficient in respect of her and the Child’s monthly expenses. As the Husband was already paying for the Wife and the Child’s rent and utilities and the Child’s school and therapy fees, the narrow issue before me was whether the $2,000.00 in cash maintenance provided by the Husband was sufficient for the Wife and Child’s remaining _reasonable_ monthly expenses. To this end, the Husband advanced two arguments. First, the monthly expenses advanced by the Wife were not supported by receipts, and second, that the Wife is fully capable of maintaining herself as she is well-qualified to work and had substantial financial resources of her own.

13     Having considered the Parties’ evidence and submissions, I was of the view that the maintenance the Husband currently provides is inadequate in the circumstances of this case.

14     I first considered the monthly expenses advanced by the Wife for both her and the Child. The Husband submitted that the Wife has not made out her claim that her monthly expenses amount to $2,500.00 and the Child’s monthly expenses amount to $3,800.00. The Husband argued that the receipts exhibited by the Wife in her Affidavit were nowhere near what was claimed. I did not find merit in the Husband’s argument as the nature and extent of what was claimed by the Wife in relation to her and the Child’s expenses were not exceptional. See _UEB v UEC_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHCF 5</span> at \[13\]. The court is adequately placed in the circumstances of this case to assess what would be reasonable in the whole. Since the objective of interim maintenance pursuant to s. 69 of the Women’s Charter is to help the Wife and the Child overcome their immediate financial needs, I was of the view that only several items and amounts of expenses advanced by the Wife were reasonable, amounting to a total of $4,000.00. These comprised $1,500.00 for their food and groceries, $1,100.00 for expenses relating to their domestic helper, $900.00 for public transport, and a miscellaneous amount of $500.00 for their medical, grooming, and household needs. It is perhaps useful to note that these amounts were comparable to, if not less than, the Husband’s own expenses as set out in his Affidavit save for the expenses relating to his domestic helper employed on a part-time basis.[^6]

15     After ascertaining what were the _reasonable_ monthly expenses that the Husband did not pay for directly, I considered the Husband’s argument that the Wife is fully capable of maintaining herself as she is well-qualified to work and had substantial financial resources of her own. The Husband referred to approximately $350,000.00 in her offshore bank accounts. During the hearing, the Wife did not deny having access to those financial resources and accepted that she was earning interest from those bank accounts. She however explained that it would be costly to repatriate the money because of the high transfer fees involved.

16     I agreed with the Husband, but to a limited extent. It was not unreasonable for the Wife to concentrate her efforts towards the care of the Child _until this juncture_ because of the Child’s specific needs in this case and because of the Husband’s then expectation that the Wife use some part of her freed-up time to look after the Child.[^7] I was also cognisant of the Husband’s submission that the Wife hired a domestic helper to outsource all childcare and household work, and thus, argued that the Wife is neither contributing to the childcare and household responsibilities nor making any effort to get a job or income.[^8] I found the Husband’s submission overly simplistic, ignorant and curious. A domestic helper is not a substitute parent and does not replace one’s responsibility towards the management of their home. A domestic helper, by definition, _helps_ and seeks direction from their employer. Much effort is required from the employer to train and to ensure that tasks are completed in a timely and acceptable standard. I am sure that the the Husband, being a senior manager, will appreciate such a nuance and will take offence to any suggestion that he has outsourced his responsibilities to any employee under his charge.

17     Be that as it may, in light of the Child now attending school on weekdays from 8am to 2.45pm, I was of the view that the Wife should at the very minimum return to part-time employment during the periods when the Child is attending school or therapy. Though this specific point was not canvassed by the Husband, I found such an opportunity for employment during the said periods to be material. The Wife is a Singapore Permanent Resident and she has confirmed that there are no immigration impediments for her to work. Further, she has experience working in the recruitment industry in the region from 2008 to June 2016, until she stopped working to care for the Child. It was therefore reasonable to expect her to pursue some form of part-time employment in the industry she left. I was nevertheless cognisant that she has been out of employment and the industry for about four and a half years and would consequently require reasonable time to find her find feet. I found three months to be a reasonable period for the Wife to do that. Hence, I ordered that the Husband continue to support her by way of maintenance for the full $4,000 in reasonable monthly expenses _until April 2021_. In arriving at this decision, I also considered the Wife’s financial resources in her offshore bank accounts. I accepted the Wife’s reason why she did not draw down on her offshore accounts in the past as it was not reasonable in the circumstances given the substantial fees involved.

18     As the Wife filed for maintenance in September 2020 and in light of the Wife being a homemaker during the same period, I found it equitable to order the Husband’s interim maintenance obligations of $4,000.00 to be backdated to September 2020. Since the Husband has been paying $2,000.00 from September 2020 to February 2021, I ordered the Husband pay the Wife the difference of $2,000.00 per month for six months in one lump sum of $12,000.00. There was no dispute that Husband can more than afford such a lump sum payment and I accordingly ordered that he makes the payment within 14 days.

19     With effect from 1 May 2021, the Wife would be in a position to partially support herself. I considered her last drawn monthly salary of $9,100.00 and found that that it would be reasonable for the interim maintenance payable by the Husband to be reduced to $2,100.00 monthly in total for the Wife and the Child. This amount comprises $1,000.00 for their food and groceries, $550.00 for expenses relating to their domestic helper, $300.00 for transport, and a miscellaneous amount of $250.00 for the Child’s medical, grooming, and household needs. In other words, I have taken $1,900.00 to be the Wife’s part-time earning capacity during the periods when the Child is attending school or therapy.

20     In addition to the above, I ordered the Husband to continue paying for the rental of the Wife and the Child’s apartment capped at $4,500.00 per month, their apartment’s utilities, the Child’s school and school-related fees, and the Child’s therapy fees. Any expenses incurred in addition to the above for the Wife and the Child shall be borne by the Wife commencing 1 May 2021. In his Affidavit, the Husband indicated that he is willing to continue paying for the Child’s school and school-related fees, and the Child’s therapy fees.[^9] He however indicated that he should cease paying for the rental of the Wife and the Child’s apartment and their utilities in July 2021 once the Wife returns to employment.[^10] On the latter, I did not find it equitable to accede to the Husband’s request in light of the Husband’s significantly higher earning capacity when compared to the Wife’s part-time earning capacity.

## Conclusion

21     At the conclusion of the hearing, the Husband’s counsel submitted for the court to make no order as to costs. Since the Parties’ conduct fell within the margin of reasonableness in the proceedings before me, I agreed with counsel and made no order as to costs.

22     I wish to make a parting observation. Both Parties appeared to be very much concerned with the dollars and cents at the focus of the present dispute before me. It was therefore somewhat ironic that both did not adequately appreciate the negative impact of their senseless wider acrimony on their respective financial resources that they so desperately seek to preserve. It is not too late for them to reassess the trajectory of their dispute and seek amicable compromise in the related matters ahead.
