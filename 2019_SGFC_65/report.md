extension of time – case management

24 June 2019

### District Judge Nicole Loh:

1       Parties were married for slightly more than 3 years. It appears that the parties in this case have been in litigation for an equivalent time as their actual marriage. The judge-led approach in resolving family disputes in Part 3 of the Family Justice Rules is instrumental in preventing them from being mired in litigation instead of moving on with their respective lives.

2       The Wife has appealed against my directions given at a case conference on 24 May 2019. However, what she sets out as my directions in her Notice of Appeal is inaccurate. For clarity, I set out my directions given on 24 May 2019 below:

> a.     No extension of time will be granted to the Wife to serve any request for discovery and interrogatories.

> b.     Parties to file and exchange 2nd Ancillary Affidavits by 5 July 2019. No extensions will be given as 6 weeks’ timeframe is being given to parties.

> c.     Case Conference is adjourned to 12 July 2019 at 9:30am.

> d.     No order as to cost against the Wife for the case conference.

3       To understand the reasons behind the directions given, a brief case chronology that is relevant is set out below:

##### Parties’ discovery and interrogatories process

4       From the above chronology, directions were first given to parties to serve Requests for Discovery and Interrogatories on 12 January 2018. By then, both parties have already been served with each other’s Affidavit of Assets and Means for more than a year. The discovery process was held back because of the pending civil suit affected the matrimonial assets that would be the subject matter of the ancillary proceedings. This was resolved with the determination by High Court on 11 December 2017 so that discovery could proceed.

5       Both parties exercised their right to serve discovery and interrogatories requests and applications were subsequently filed and dealt with. Appeals relating to this discovery was also dealt with. The entire timeframe taken by parties to resolve this discovery and interrogatories process including its appeal spanned January 2018 to March 2019.

##### Delays caused by the Wife

6       During the case conferences between February 2019 to April 2019, despite repeated queries by the Court, the Wife’s Counsel could not identify the issues of dispute and confirm if she wished to commence a separate civil suit. The Husband’s own separate civil suit in relation to properties allegedly held on trust was filed in November 2015 and this was conclusively resolved by the Court of Appeal in November 2018. There was no reason given as to why the Wife did not file a separate High Court Suit to ascertain if her own properties were held on trust at any point within this time period. Nonetheless, adjournments were given for the Wife to file a separate suit but she eventually chose not to file. This issue caused a delay of 2 months to the proceedings

7       The Wife’s counsel was also unable to address the Court on the claims made by the Wife on the Husband’s assets. This is despite directions being given on 15 February 2019 to prepare a Schedule/List of Assets for the next case conference. This was not done by the next case conferences of 22 March or 12 April 2019. It was only on 26 April 2019, the Court was orally (directions were given thrice for written schedules) apprised of the Wife’s claim on the Defendant’s assets.

8       Multiple extensions of time due to these issues were sought by the Wife and granted.

##### Wife’s attempt to revisit the discovery and interrogatories process

9       At the case conference on 26 April 2019, the Wife’s counsel indicated that they wished to apply for discovery in view of the fact they have only just gotten instructions from their client as to her claims on the Husband’s assets.

10     The Husband’s counsel objected as parties had already gone through the discovery and interrogatories process which included an appeal on the orders made. The Wife’s counsel did not identify what he would be requesting for and stated that discovery can be avoided if the Husband is willing to provide the use and movement of funds. The Husband’s counsel had to inform him that documents had already been earlier provided. When questioned why this was done now, the Wife’s counsel stated that they were waiting for the outcome of the High Court Suit (which had been concluded for almost 1.5 years and its appeal concluded for 5 months). It did not appear that Wife’s counsel had taken stock of the case even after the repeated adjournments given (see paragraphs 6 to 7 above) and still did not know what was required to advance the Wife’s case prior to this case conference.

11     Even though:

> a.     I agreed with the Husband’s counsel that the discovery process that had arisen from the Affidavit of Assets and Means had completed;

> b.     the Wife’s counsel was unable to articulate what additional documents were being sought;

> c.     it appears that the Wife is making this late request for discovery only because she has repeatedly delayed in determining her own claim in the proceedings,

I still gave directions to the Wife serve any request for discovery and interrogatories in 1 week and I directed that no extensions in future will be given for this request.

##### Wife’s failure to comply with timeframe

12     At the next case conference on 24 May 2019, notwithstanding that 4 weeks have passed since the last case conference, the Wife’s counsel sought an extension of time of 1 week on the basis that a new affidavit had been received from the Husband. This was the discovery affidavit which was filed on 26 April 2019, the date of the last case conference.

13     I did not give a further extension due to the following reasons:

> a.     In giving the directions at the earlier case conference on 26 April 2019, I had already indicated that no further extensions would be granted;

> b.     Direction for the request for discovery and interrogatories to be served was a generous indulgence granted to the Wife given the circumstances as highlighted in 11a to c above.

> c.     Notwithstanding the discovery affidavit which was filed by the Husband on 26 April 2019, there was no reason why the Wife required a further extension of 1 week from the case conference, i.e. she required a total of 5 weeks after the affidavit was filed to serve a further request for discovery/interrogatories.

14     The Wife’s lackadaisical manner in advancing her case has caused multiple adjournments. This case was commenced in 2015 and whilst the civil suit stayed the progress of the ancillary matters proceedings initially, that has been long been resolved. The case has been at a standstill at least from February 2019 because of the Wife’s possible belated civil suit (which was then abandoned), her failure to identify the issues in dispute in the division of matrimonial assets, the attempt at belated discovery due to her recently finalised position on her claim.

15     Court directions are meant to be complied with. The directions given were to ensure the just, expeditious and economical disposal of the proceedings as per rule 23(2)(b) of the Family Justice Rules. Extensions of time are not as of right. It is for the applicant seeking an extension to justify to the Court why an extension should be granted. A mere submission that the party’s case would be prejudiced is insufficient. The opportunity for the Wife to pursue her case through discovery was given. It is her duty to advance and preserve her case; not the Court’s.

##### The Wife’s application for interim maintenance

16     The Wife filed this application on 25 October 2018. Between February 2019 to April 2019, the Court had repeatedly asked the Wife’s counsel if this application should be dealt with together with the Ancillary hearing. The Wife’s Counsel was finally able to confirm at the case conference on 12 April 2019 that should no further applications be filed for the ancillary proceeding, the interim maintenance application can be dealt with together at the ancillary matters hearing.

17     At the case conference before me on 24 May 2019, the Wife appears to have changed her position. Counsel (albeit a different solicitor from the one who attended on 12 April 2019) sought for the application to be proceeded with and for directions to be given for the Husband to file his reply affidavit to her application. It was clarified that the Husband already intended to do so together with his second ancillary affidavit, as discussed at the earlier case conference on 12 April 2019. There was no need for a separate affidavit to be filed.

18     The Wife’s counsel seemed to argue against the fixing of the interim maintenance application for hearing together with the final ancillary matters hearing. I could not understand the basis of her argument, given that I was giving directions for the second ancillary affidavit and would in all likelihood, be fixing the case for the final ancillary hearing. There was no reason to separate the interim maintenance application from the final ancillary hearing as both would be ready for hearing at the next case conference.

19     The Wife’s counsel tried to argue that the ancillary hearing would only be fixed in a few months’ time. However, this was due to the fact that the Wife’s counsel had asked for a longer timeframe to file their second ancillary affidavit because the Wife was out of Singapore for the whole of June 2019. The longer timeframe and therefore the later eventual hearing date was caused by the Wife herself. It is unfair for the Wife, who is content with delay in the disposal of the main matter because she is not available, to then expedite and pursue another interlocutory application because she needs urgent interim relief.

20     I therefore gave directions for the second ancillary affidavit to be filed and exchanged, with the Husband’s response to the interim maintenance application to be contained in the same affidavit. Once this is complied with, both the main matter and interim maintenance application will be ready for hearing and can be fixed together in the interest of saving cost and to deal with the entire proceedings holistically.
