Ancillary Matters – short marriage with one child – maintenance of wife

8 March 2021

### District Judge Geraldine Kang:

## Brief Background

1       For ease of reference, parties shall be referred to Plaintiff Wife (33 years old) and Defendant Husband (37 years old) in this written grounds of decision.

2       Briefly, parties were married on 1 March 2015 and a son was borne to them on 17 January 2016. The marriage was a tumultuous one and the Wife moved out of the parties’ matrimonial home sometime in May 2019. The Wife commenced divorce proceedings on the basis of the Husband’s unreasonable behaviour and interim judgement was granted on 6 March 2020, making the length of this marriage approximately 5 years.

3       As parties had reached an amicable resolution of the issues in connection with their young child, the only issues for my determination were in respect of the division of the matrimonial assets and the maintenance of the Wife.

4       The Husband was employed as a Senior Engineer with an average monthly take home salary of approximately $4,302 whereas the Wife was self-employed as a TCM physician with a declared monthly income of approximately $3000.

5       Having heard parties and the evidence in this matter, a summary of my orders is set out as follows:

> I.     Each party is to retain their own assets in their sole names.

> II.     In respect of the matrimonial flat, the Wife was to transfer her share, interests and rights to the Husband within 6 months of the date of Final Judgement, subject to the following:

>> a.       The Husband is to pay the Wife 42.55% of the value of the matrimonial flat ($436,000) less the mortgage loan as at the date of completion of the transfer.

>> b.       The Wife is to make all necessary CPF refunds to her CPF accounts of CPF monies used for the payment of the flat.

>> c.       The Husband shall be responsible for repayment of the mortgage loan and all costs and expenses of the transfer.

> III.     In respect of the child’s insurance policy, any proceeds of maturity, surrender or termination shall be placed into an account for the child’s sole benefit.

> IV.     In respect of the Wife’s maintenance, the Husband shall contribute $400 per month wef 30 November 2020 and thereafter on the last day of each month.

> V.     Liberty to apply.

> VI.     No orders as to costs.

> VII.     Each party to bear their own costs.

6       The Husband is now appealing against my decision only respect of the ordered monthly sum of $400 as the Wife’s maintenance. Accordingly, this written grounds of decision shall deal only with the need for spousal maintenance upon a divorce.

## (1)   Power of court to order maintenance

7       The law relating to the power of the court to order maintenance and the assessment of such maintenance is found in sections 113 and Section 114 (Cap. 353).

> Section 113

> (_1_)     _The court may order a man to pay maintenance to his wife or former wife, or order a woman to pay maintenance to her incapacitated husband or incapacitated former husband -_

>> (_a_)     _during the course of any matrimonial proceedings, or_

>> (_b_)     _when granting or subsequent to the grant of a judgement of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage._

> _Section 114_

> (_1_)     _In determining the amount of any maintenance to be paid by a man to his wife or former wife, or by a woman to her incapacitated husband or incapacitated former husband, the court shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the following matters:_

>> (_a_)     _the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future._

>> (_b_)     _the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;_

>> (_c_)     _the standard of living enjoyed by the family before the breakdown of the marriage;_

>> (_d_)     _the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage;_

>> (_e_)     _any physical or mental disability of either of the parties to the marriage;_

>> (_f_)     _the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family; and_

>> (_g_)     _in the case of proceedings for divorce or nullity of marriage, the value to either of the parties to the marriage of any benefit (for example, a pension) which, by reason of the dissolution or annulment of the marriage that party will lose the chance of acquiring._

> (_2_)     _In exercising its powers under this section, the court shall endeavour so to place the parties, so far as it is practicable and, having regard to their conduct, just to do so, in the financial position in which they would have been if the marriage had not broken down and each had properly discharged his or her financial obligations and responsibilities towards the other._

8       It is accepted and trite law that the overarching principle embodied in section 114(2) (Cap. 353) is financial preservation which requires the wife to be maintained at a standard, which is, to a reasonable extent, commensurate with the standard of living she enjoyed during the marriage (see **_Foo Ah Yan v Chiam Heng Chow_** \[2012\] 2 SLR). The Court of Appeal further explained that an order for maintenance of a former spouse “**_serves the far more ambitious objective of giving her a fair share of the surplus wealth that had been acquired by the spouses during the subsistence of the marriage_**”.

9        **_Tan Sue Ann Melissa v Lim Siang Bok Dennis \[2004\] SLR 376_** stated that the imposition of a legal order for maintenance of an ex-spouse was to even out any financial inequalities between the ex-spouses, taking into account any economic prejudice suffered by the wife during the marriage.

10     The Court of Appeal in _ATE v ATD <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGCA 2</span>_ enunciated and reiterated the principle of awarding maintenance to an ex-spouse. In summary, the underlying rationale and purpose for the award of maintenance generally to former wives was that of **_financial preservation at a standard of living that she enjoyed during the marriage_**. It was also observed with approval that an award of maintenance for a former wife takes into account the fact that a former wife ought to try to regain self-sufficiency and that **_an order of maintenance is not intended to create life-long dependency on the former husband_**.

**_\[my emphasis\]_**

## (2)   The Wife’s Case

11     The Wife sought to claim maintenance for herself but left the specific quantum to be determined by the Court, submitting however that a lump sum maintenance of $40,000 was appropriate in this present instance.

12     It was not disputed that during the marriage, when parties were residing together, she did not work in the initial 2 years of the marriage and was a homemaker; being the primary caregiver to their child. Subsequently, she rejoined the workforce in June 2017 she was employed as a TCM physician earning a monthly income of about $2000.

13     At the time of the hearing, the Wife was a sole proprietor of a TCM business she set up after she was retrenched by her former employers. At present, she was paying herself a salary of $3000

14     A brief summary of the breakdown of her maintenance claim and the Court’s assessment is tabulated as follows[^1].

## (3)   The Husband’s Case

15     The Husband’s position was that the Wife’s expenses were inflated and that she was clearly self-sufficient now as a sole proprietor (although he did submit on what he felt were more reasonable expenses that she should be incurring); accordingly no order of maintenance should be made in her favour as this was also a short marriage.

## (4)   The Court’s Findings and Decision

16     It is not disputed that this was a short marriage and that the marriage was a rather tumultuous one. Nonetheless, there was a child borne to the marriage for which the Wife was the primary caregiver at the onset of the child’s infancy.

17     I took into account the fact that the husband had been staying rent free in the matrimonial home. The Wife and child were currently staying with her family.

18     Whilst the Wife has (to her credit) regained employment, this should not be taken to her disadvantage to allow the Husband to negate his obligations to an ex-spouse post marriage.

19     Accordingly, I made the orders I did and that each party were to bear their own costs.
