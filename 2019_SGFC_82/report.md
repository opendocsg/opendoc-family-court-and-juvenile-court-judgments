Ancillary Matters

4 August 2019

### District Judge Guy Ghazali:

## Background

1       Parties solemnised their marriage on 31 October 2008 in India. The marriage was registered in India on 21 November 2008.

2       There is one child to the marriage. The child, \[R\], female, will be turning 10 years old this year.

3       The Plaintiff-Wife (“the Wife”) filed the Writ for Divorce on 22 August 2017.

4       Interim Judgment was granted on 4 April 2018 on the Wife’s claim and the Defendant-Husband’s (“the Husband”) counterclaim. Both parties relied on the fact of unreasonable behaviour on the part of the other party in obtaining the divorce.

5       As at the date of the Interim Judgment, parties had been married for about 9½ years.

## Ancillary matters hearing

6       I heard the ancillary matters hearing on 19 March 2019 and 11 April 2019.

7       At the hearing on 19 March 2019, both Counsel informed me that:

> (i)     It was agreed that parties would have joint custody of R. The issue of care and control was, however, in dispute.

> (ii)     Parties agreed to retain assets in their respective names except for the matrimonial flat at \[address redacted\] (“the Matrimonial Flat”) and the plot of land in Nagappatinam, India (“the India property”). Parties further agreed that the assets that were retained by the parties shall not be taken into account in the court’s determination of the Matrimonial Flat and the India property. For completeness, I would add that prior to the hearing, both parties had raised issues with regard to the return of certain jewellery in the other party’s possession. In this respect, parties also agreed that insofar as one party was in possession of the other party’s jewellery, such jewellery was to be returned to the rightful owner.

8       The outstanding issues for determination were therefore division of the Matrimonial Flat and the India property, the care and control of \[R\] (and accordingly, access to \[R\]), the maintenance of \[R\] and the maintenance of the Wife.

9       On 22 April 2019, I made the following ancillary matters orders:

> _“a_.     _Save as set out below, parties agree to retain assets in their respective names. Parties further agree that following this, insofar as one party is in possession of the other party’s jewellery, such jewellery shall be returned to the rightful owner. Parties also agree that the assets that are being retained by the parties in this clause shall not be taken into account in the court’s determination of the division of the \[Matrimonial Flat\] and the \[India property\]._

> _b_.     _The \[Husband\] shall retain the India property._

> _c_.     _The \[Husband\] shall be entitled to $18,661.43 of the \[Wife’s\] CPF monies pursuant to section 112 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353). Within one month from the date of this order, the \[Wife\] shall take such steps as may be necessary to effect the transfer of a sum of $18,661.43 from her CPF Ordinary account to the \[Husband’s\] CPF Ordinary account._

> _d_.     _The CPF Board (“the Board”) shall, from the monies standing to the credit of the \[Wife\] in the following CPF account of the \[Wife\], transfer the amount specified as follows to the \[Husband’s\] CPF Ordinary Account._

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="49.64%"> <col width="50.36%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><em>[Wife]s’ CPF accounts to transfer from</em></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><em>Amounts to transfer to the [Husband’s] CPF Ordinary Account</em></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><em>Ordinary Account</em></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><em>$18,661.43</em></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

> _e_.     _Within one month of the successful transfer of the abovementioned monies from the \[Wife’s\] CPF account to the \[Husband’s\] CPF account, the \[Husband\] shall transfer (other than by way of sale) his rights, interest and title in the \[Matrimonial Flat\] to the \[Wife\] without refund to the \[Husband’s\] CPF account._

> _f_.     _This order is made subject to the Central Provident Fund Act (Cap. 36) (“CPF Act”) and the subsidiary legislation made thereunder. The Board shall give effect to the terms of this order in accordance with the provisions of the CPF Act and the subsidiary legislation made thereunder._

> _g_.     _The shortfall, if any, between the ordered amount and the payment received by the \[Husband\] from the Board or transferred to the \[Husband’s\] CPF account is a debt due from the \[Wife\] to the \[Husband\] and is recoverable as such._

> _h_.     _The parties, including the Board, shall be at liberty to apply for further directions or orders generally._

> _i_.     _The Registrar or the Assistant Registrar of the Family Justice Courts under section 31 of the Family Justice Act 2014 is empowered to execute, sign, or indorse all necessary documents relating to matters contained in this order on behalf of either party should either party fail to do so within seven (7) days of written request being made to the party._

> _j_.     _Parties shall have joint custody of the only child of the marriage, \[R\], with sole care and control to the \[Wife\]._

> _k_.     _The \[Husband\] shall have unsupervised access to the child as follows:_

>> (_i_)     _Every Tuesday and Friday from 7.30 pm to 9 pm._

>> (_ii_)    _Every Saturday from 10 am to 6 pm._

>> (_iii_)    _Every alternate school and public holiday that fall on weekdays (not including Deepavali) with effect from Labour Day from 10 am to 6 pm._

>> (_iv_)    _Every Deepavali from 10 am to 3 pm._

>> (_v_)     _Half of the June and December school holidays with effect from June 2020 with liberty to take the child overseas. In the event that the \[Husband\] wishes to take the child overseas, the \[Husband\] shall provide the \[Wife\] with at least two months’ notice of intention of such travel. The \[Husband\] shall also provide the \[Wife\] with information on dates of travel, mode of travel, itinerary, accommodation and contact details. When the child is overseas with the \[Husband\], the \[Husband\] shall ensure that the child is contactable by the \[Wife\] at all reasonable times. The \[Wife\] shall hand over the child’s passport to the \[Husband\] for purposes of such travel. The child’s passport shall be returned to the \[Wife\] at hand-over upon the conclusion of the overseas holiday access._

>> (_vi_)    _In the event that the \[Husband’s\] birthday or the child’s birthday do not fall on the \[Husband’s\] access days, the \[Husband\] shall have access to the child on these days from 7.30 pm to 9 pm._

>> (_vii_)   _Unless otherwise agreed between the parties, the child shall be picked up from and returned to the \[Wife’s\] residence._

>> (_viii_)   _In the event that the \[Wife\] intends to take the child overseas for three days or more, the \[Wife\] shall inform the \[Husband\] of the dates of travel, mode of travel, itinerary, accommodation and contact details at least two weeks before the travel. When the child is overseas with the \[Wife\], the \[Wife\] shall ensure that the child is contactable by the \[Husband\] at all reasonable times._

> _l_.     _The \[Husband\] shall continue to pay the \[Wife\] $710 per month for the maintenance of the child on the 11th day of each month into the Plaintiff’s POSB bank account number \[xxx\]._

> _m_.     _There shall be no maintenance for the \[Wife\]._

> _n_.     _Each party to bear his or her own costs.”_

10     The Husband has appealed against my entire order except the order allowing him to retain the India property (see order (b)) and the order that there shall be no maintenance for the Wife (see order (m)). The Husband has also appealed against the orders made by consent at \[7\]. I will explain the reasons for my orders but these reasons will not address the orders that were made by the consent of the parties.

## Division of matrimonial assets

11     As stated at \[8\], the parties have mutually agreed to limit the matrimonial assets for division to only the Matrimonial Flat and the India property. I will deal with these assets below.

##### (a)    Direct financial contributions to the Matrimonial Flat

12     At the hearing, the value of the Matrimonial Flat was agreed at $382,500 while the outstanding loan on the Matrimonial Flat was agreed at $337,418.45. Accordingly, both parties agreed that the net value of the Matrimonial Flat was $45,081.55.

13     Parties further agreed that at the hearing that:

> (i)     The Wife had used $10,557.10 (principal) from her Central Provident Fund (CPF) account towards the acquisition of the Matrimonial Flat.

> (ii)     The Husband had used $91,920.84 (principal) from his CPF account towards the acquisition of the Matrimonial Flat.

> (iii)     Parties’ total cash contribution towards the acquisition of the Matrimonial Flat was $116,500. Out of this sum, the Wife contributed $20,800 while the Husband contributed the remaining $95,700.

14     Following from the above, the Wife’s total direct financial contribution to the Matrimonial flat was $31,357.10 (or 14% of parties’ total) while the Husband’s total direct financial contribution to the Matrimonial Flat was $187,620.84 (or 86% of parties’ total). The ratio of parties’ direct financial contributions is therefore 14:86 in favour of the Husband. Using this ratio and applying it to the agreed net value of the Matrimonial Flat of $45,081.55, the Wife’s share of direct financial contribution to the Matrimonial Flat is $6,311.42 (i.e. 14% of agreed net value) while the Husband’s share of direct financial contribution to the Matrimonial Flat is $38,770.13 (i.e. 86% of agreed net value).

##### (b)    The India property

15     As for the India property, parties agreed to use its purchase price as its current value, which is $24,444.44. It is also undisputed by the parties that unlike the Matrimonial Flat which is in the parties’ joint names, the India property is in the Husband’s sole name.

16     Out of this sum of $24,444.44, it is the Wife’s contention that she paid $10,746.57. At the hearing, the Husband accepted that the Wife paid $8,243.75.

17     As the Wife was unable to show evidence that she contributed more than $8,243.75, which was the amount accepted by the Husband as the Wife’s contribution, I accept the Husband’s position that the Wife only contributed $8,243.75 while the remaining $16,200.69 was contributed by the Husband.

##### (c)    Ratio of parties’ total direct financial contributions to the Matrimonial Flat and the India property

18     The ratio of parties’ total direct financial contributions to the Matrimonial Flat and the India property is therefore as follows:

##### (d)    Indirect contributions

19     For indirect contributions, the Wife submitted 70-30 in her favour while the Husband submitted 35-65 in his favour.

20     I am of the view that 55-45 in favour of the Wife is appropriate in the circumstances.

21     In arriving at the above ratio, I take into account the following factors:

> i.     There were periods of time when parties were not living together. Parties married on 31 October 2008 in India. The Husband returned to Singapore first without the Wife. On 4 December 2008, the Wife joined the Husband in Singapore. From June 2009 until February 2011, the Wife returned to India while the Husband remained in Singapore. While in India, the Wife lived with her parents until October 2010 and thereafter with the Husband’s parents until February 2011. It was during this time, specifically in October 2009, that the child was born. During the time when the Wife and the child were living in India, the Wife was the sole caregiver of the child (as compared to the Husband). The Wife also started to work sometime around February/March 2010 until October 2010. During this time, the Wife was supporting herself and the child with assistance from her parents. When the Wife lived with the Husband’s parents, the Husband made financial provisions for the Wife and the child. From February 2011 until June 2011, the Wife and the child came back to Singapore to live with the Husband. During this time, the Wife was not working and took care of the child. From June 2011 until May 2012, the Wife and the child returned to India to live with the Wife’s parents. In June 2012, the Wife and the child moved to the Husband’s parents’ home (in India) until November 2012. From November 2012 to-date, the Wife and the child have been living in Singapore with the Husband except for a period of three months when she and the child were living with her friend.

> ii.     While parties are living together, the Husband was the financial provider for the family. Since the Wife started working in March 2013, she too contributed to the family’s expenses although the Husband continued to be the main provider.

> iii.     From May 2013 until March 2018, the Husband received rental income from the rental of a bedroom in the Matrimonial Flat. The Husband retained the rental income (which also comprised the Wife’s share) which was used towards the family and household expenses.

> iv.     At all material times, the Wife was the primary caregiver of the child.

##### (e)    Average ratio

22     Having determined the parties’ direct financial and indirect contributions, the average ratio of parties’ contributions is as follows.

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="48%"> <col width="26.74%"> <col width="25.26%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Wife</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Husband</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Direct financial contributions</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(50% weightage)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">21</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">79</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Indirect contributions</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(50% weightage)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">55</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">45</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Average ratio</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">38</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">62</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">In figures ($69,525.99)</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$26,419.88</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$43,106.11</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

23     In this regard, I note that it is not the position of the parties that I should be applying a different weightage or that I should be adjusting the average ratio.

##### (f)    Consequential orders

24     To implement the above order on division, I have ordered for the Husband to retain the India property which is in his sole name. As the Husband’s share pursuant to the division order is $43,106.11 and considering that the value of the India property is $24,444.44, there is a shortfall of $18,661.67 that the Husband is entitled to. To satisfy this shortfall, I have ordered for the sum of $18,661.43 to be transferred from the Wife’s CPF Ordinary Account to the Husband’s CPF Ordinary Account (the difference of $0.24 being a calculation error which was not highlighted at the hearing). I have further ordered for the transfer of the CPF monies to be effected within one month from the date of my order.

25     In ordering the aforementioned transfer from the Wife’s CPF Ordinary account, the parties’ agreement to retain assets in their respective names (which has been encapsulated in the form of a consent order) is relevant. The Wife’s CPF monies are part of the assets that parties have agreed to retain. Parties’ intention, as reflected in the consent order, is for the court to disregard the value of the assets that parties are retaining when the court determines the _division_ of the Matrimonial Flat and the India property. Consistent with the consent order, the court did not take into account the value of the assets that parties are retaining in arriving at the division of the Matrimonial Flat and the India property. However, this does not mean that the court cannot affect the assets that parties are retaining to bring about a practicable implementation of the division order relating to the Matrimonial Flat and the India property.

26     As stated at \[22\], the Wife’s share pursuant to the division of the Matrimonial Flat and the India property is $26,419.88. Considering that she will be transferring to the Husband a sum of $18,661.43 from her CPF Ordinary Account to the Husband’s Ordinary Account to effect a practicable implementation of the division order even though her CPF monies are not liable for division pursuant to parties’ agreement, I have ordered for the Matrimonial Flat (with a net value of $45,081.55) to be transferred to her without refund to the Husband’s CPF account. The transfer of the Matrimonial Flat is to be effected within one month of the transfer of the monies from the Wife’s CPF Ordinary Account to the Husband’s CPF Ordinary Account.

27     In the interest of completeness and noting that the Husband has filed an appeal against the division order, I would add that it is the Husband’s submissions that the Matrimonial Flat should be sold. As there will not be enough money to make full refund into the parties’ respective CPF accounts after payment of the outstanding loan, it is the Husband’s position that the balance proceeds after payment of the outstanding loan are to be refunded into parties’ respective CPF accounts based on the proportion of their CPF contributions. Assuming that the balance proceeds are per the agreed net value of the Matrimonial Flat, which is $45,081.55 (and without deducing any further sums for costs and expenses related to the sale which would be payable in the event of actual sale), and based on agreed figures, the proportion of CPF refund would be about 10:90 in favour of the Husband. This is on the basis that the Wife had used $10,557.10 from her CPF account towards the acquisition of the Matrimonial Flat and there is accrued interest of $659.26 to be refunded to the CPF. As for the Husband, he had used $91,920.84 from his CPF account towards the acquisition of the Matrimonial Flat and there is accrued interest of $8,998.93 to be refunded to the CPF. Going by the Husband’s approach, about $4,500 (rounded off) will be refunded into the Wife’s CPF account. Assuming that the Husband retains the India property, in order for the present division order to be workable, he will have to pay the Wife in excess of $20,000. If we compare this to the present consequential orders that have been made, the Husband does not have to make any out-of-pocket payment to the Wife. Instead, he will be in receipt of a sum of $18,661.43 from the Wife’s CPF Ordinary Account that will be paid into his CPF Ordinary Account. Also, the present consequential orders allow the Wife who has care and control of the child to retain the Matrimonial Flat.

## Custody, care and control and access of the child, R

28     As stated at \[7\], parties agreed to have joint custody of the child.

29     Having considered the facts of this case including the matters at \[21\] above, I am satisfied that the Wife is the primary caregiver of the child. This fact does not appear to be largely contested by the Husband. The Husband has asked for sole care and control of the child, or alternatively, shared care and control, on the primary basis of his alleged difficulties in having access to the child even though they are living under the same roof. Having directed my mind to the paramount consideration of the best interest of the child, I have granted sole care and control of the child to the Wife. There is also no evidence to suggest that the Husband will not be able to exercise access to the child if this court makes unsupervised access orders in his favour.

30     In the Husband’s Counsel’s written submissions, the Husband has asked for, among other things, the following access orders in the event that this court grants the Wife care and control of the child:

> i.     Every Tuesday and Friday from 7.30 pm to 9 pm;

> ii.     Every Sunday from 10 am to 6 pm;

> iii.     Every alternate Public Holiday (excluding Deepavali) from 10 am to 6 pm;

> iv.     On Deepavali every year, from 10 am to 3 pm; and

> v.     The 2nd half of school holidays.

31     The access orders that this court has made at \[9\] are very much in line with the Husband’s position in this regard. I have also included birthday access in that if the Husband’s birthday or the child’s birthday do not fall on the Husband’s access days, the Husband shall have access to the child on these days from 7.30 pm to 9 pm.

## Maintenance for the child

32     The Wife seeks maintenance of $930 for the child on the basis that the child’s expenses are $1,453 as follows.

33     The Husband’s position is that the child’s monthly expenses are only $754 and that each party should bear half of this sum.

34     In this regard, it is relevant to note that the court has made a maintenance order under section 69 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353) on 11 July 2018 requiring the Husband to pay $710 per month for the child’s maintenance. As there were ongoing divorce proceedings, the said maintenance was in effect an interim maintenance order for the child. It is undisputed between the parties that when the court made the order, the court had found the monthly expenses of the child to be $1,100.

35     For purposes of the ancillary matters hearing, I also find that the reasonable expenses of the child are about $1,100 per month. In addition, there was no change of circumstances warranting a departure from the finding of the court in July 2018.

36     The Wife earns a gross monthly income of $4,367 with a take-home income of $3,487. On affidavit, the Husband’s last drawn gross monthly income as at November 2018 was $6,800 with a take-home income of $5,591. While it is not clear whether the Husband has secured new employment, his contention as to why he should not continue to pay $710 per month rests on his disagreement on the child’s expenses and not his inability to make such payment.

37     In the circumstances, I find it reasonable to order that the Husband shall continue to pay the Wife $710 per month for the maintenance of the child.

## Maintenance for the Wife

38     For the wife’s maintenance, the Wife has asked for nominal maintenance of $1.00 per month.

39     There is no satisfactory reason to order nominal maintenance for the Wife. I am of the view that the Wife is capable of maintaining herself. I have therefore ordered for there to be no maintenance for the Wife.

## Costs

40     Both Counsel informed the court that they are not seeking costs against the other party. I accordingly ordered for each party to bear his or her own costs.
