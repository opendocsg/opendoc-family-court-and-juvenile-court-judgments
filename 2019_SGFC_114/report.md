Shared care and control – Guardianship of infants act – Access

22 October 2019

### District Judge Wendy Yu:

## Introduction

1       The Parties in these proceedings are medical doctors and were married on xxx 2015. They have a young 2 year old daughter, B, who was born on xxx 2017 (“the Child”).

2       Parties are embroiled in an extremely acrimonious relationship. Various applications were spawned out of their marital conflict, including no less than 13 applications for personal protection orders (“PPO”) by parties themselves or their extended family, an application for committal for breach of access orders, as well as an application for interim maintenance (MSSxxx/2018). Five of these PPO applications were based on an incident on 6 April 2019 during the transfer of access of the Child, which shall be elaborated below. Multiple police reports were filed[^1] between the parties against each other and by their extended family over the conflict between the families. The Parties and their family members had called the Police on numerous occasions due to the conflict between the families as the marriage broke down.

3       The Mother had moved out of the matrimonial home, bringing the Child with her on 25 December 2017[^2]. The Father has alleged that the Mother had refused to agree with co-parenting options or visitations at the centre proposed by xxx Moral Services[^3]. The Father then filed an OSG application (OSGxxx/2018) on 1 June 2018 for the following orders:

> “1.     Pending the determination of (3) below, that (the Father) shall have immediate interim access to B (BC No. xxx) (“the Child”) as follows:-

>> a.       Once a week at the Divorce Support Specialist Agencies; and

>> b.       Every Saturday from 9.00 am to 7.00 pm.

> 2.     Parties shall have joint custody to the child.

> 3.     Parties shall have shared care and control of the child.

> 4.     That (the Mother) pays the costs of the application.

> 5.     Such further or other relief as the Honourable Court deems fit and just.”

4       The Mother filed a cross application (OSG 178/2018) on 27 August 2018 in response, for the following orders:

> “1.     (The Mother) shall have sole custody, care and control of the child, namely, B (BC xxx). Alternatively, the parties shall have joint custody of the child subject to the following conditions:

>> (a)       (The Mother) shall have the right to take decisions concerning the child’s education, enrichment classes and extra-curricular activities when the child grows, if the Defendant refuses to cooperate in the child’s upbringing or withholds consent when the child is registered or enrolled in kindergarten or primary school.

>> (b)       (The Mother) shall have the right to take decisions concerning the child’s medical care and good choices if (the Father) continues refuses to cooperate in the child’s upbringing and continues to use times when the child is unwell to make false allegations of child abuse against others or to get medical records.

> 2.     (The Mother) shall have sole custody of the child under these circumstances:

>> \-       (The Father) continues to make false allegations of child abuse against (the Mother) or (the Mother’s) family members including false allegations of killing the child.

>> \-       (the Father) misuses the child to make false allegations of a sexual nature against others.

>> \-       (the Father) or his family members record the child’s statements to manipulate her or make false allegations against others.

>> \-       (the Father) and his family members continue to edit their recordings and falsify evidence to the court to use against others.

>> \-       (the Father) misuses times when the child is unwell to accuse her caregivers or others of child abuse for his own personal gain.

>> \-       (the Father) misuses times when the child is unwell to accuse her caregivers or others of child abuse for his own personal gain.

>> \-       (the Father) takes away the child’s essential things, namely, health booklet, birth certificate and other important documents to his parents’ place in order to get control of situations.

> 3\. (The Father) shall have supervised access to the child. (The Father) shall not have any overnight or overseas access to the child.

> 4.     (The Father) shall be restrained from recording (the Mother) and the child during the access.

> 5.     Both parties and their family members shall refrain from passing denigrating remarks about (the Mother) or (the Mother’s) family members to the child.

> 6.     (The Father’s) father shall be restrained from interfering with the access time or accompanying (the Father) during the access or recording the child during the access time.

> 7.     (The Father) shall pay a reasonable sum towards maintenance of the child. The parties’ CPF Medisave monies shall be used for the child’s hospitalisation expenses. The child’s maintenance sum shall be reviewed when the child grows. Both parties’ shall top up the child’s CDA Account regularly.

> 8.     (The Father) shall settle the arrears of maintenance of the child.

> 9.     (The Father) shall attend parenting classes, anger management classes and psychiatric counselling to help him act in the child’s best interest and not misuse her repeatedly for false allegations.

> 10.     (The Father) shall not make any more false allegations of child abuse. (The Father) shall not make any false allegations that (the Mother) tried to kill the child or others. (The Father) shall not misuse the times when the child is unwell to get medico-legal records.

> 11.     The child’s personal belongings such as her schoolbooks, homework, personal things, health booklet, passport, birth certificate and her school bag will be under (the Mother’s) care. (The Father) and his family cannot take these things to get control of the child.

> 12.     (The Father) shall pay the cost of this application.

> 13.     Liberty to apply.”

## Background and History of Applications

5       It is necessary to provide some background between the parties as it will help to explain my decision.

6       There were three PPO applications (SSxxx/2018, SSxxx/2017 and SSxxx/2017) between the parties which had to be resolved before the determination of the OSG applications. Both parties had filed for a PPO against each other for the Child and the outcome will affect the order for custody care and control, and access.

7       In SSxxx/2017, the Mother had filed for a PPO against the Father for herself and the Child, based on an incident on 18 September 2017, including allegations of violence since the fifth month of her pregnancy. SSxxx/2017 is the Father’s application for PPO against the Mother, for a PPO for himself and the Child, based on various incidents including that of September 2017. SSxxx/2018 is the Father’s application for PPO against the Mother based on incidents in December 2017 and January 2018. I had heard all three applications together, and had, on 6 March 2019, granted a PPO for the Mother against the Father, and a PPO for the Father against the Mother, both of which shall be valid until the Final Judgment is granted in Dxxx/2019. I had dismissed both parties’ respective PPO applications against each other for the Child. I had also ordered both parties to attend counselling. There was no appeal filed against these orders.

8       It was necessary for the Court to make orders for interim access, while the Court waited for the Custody Evaluation Report (“CER”) to be prepared in these proceedings.

### DSSA Orders

9       DJ Darryl Soh made an order for supervised visitation and an order for counselling at the Divorce Support Specialist Agencies (“DSSA”) at a case conference on 29 June 2018, to facilitate access between parties embroiled in a high conflict relationship.

10     On 28 August 2018, I had made another DSSA order and granted the Father interim weekly supervised access on Saturdays for two hours at the DSSA with effect from 8 September from 11.30 am to 1.30 pm. On weeks when the Mother is working during the above access times and is unable to facilitate access, the lawyers were to liaise with each other for parties to agree on the alternative access time (for two hours) on Saturdays. The access was supervised then as the Father stated that he only had minimal access to the Child since the Mother moved out of the matrimonial home with the Child in December 2017. I was of the view that the Child will need time then to familiarise herself with the Father and to build that Father-Daughter bond, with the assistance with the staff from the DSSA.

11     I made a third DSSA order on 20 December 2018, for a two way supervised visitation every Saturday from 11.30 am to 1.30 pm for the Child, at the DSSA for eight sessions, with effect from 29 December 2018. A review was fixed after a DSSA report was submitted to the Court.

12     Unfortunately, the above DSSA arrangement started to break down.

13     In the Father’s evidence, the Father has stated that despite the DJ Darryl Soh’s order being made on 29 June 2018, the enrolment/Intake Assessment was only completed by the Mother on 28 July 2018[^4]. The first supervised visitation session commenced on 25 August 2018, and the Father had alleged that the Mother was late in bringing the Child on 25 August 2018 and 8 September 2018, with the Child being on medical leave on 15 September 2018 with make-up session fixed on 27 October 2018. According to the Father, only seven visitations have materialised from the first Order conducted over a four-month period.[^5] The Father has also stated on affidavit that the Mother had not complied with the DSSA staff’s instructions for her to wait outside the room so that the Father can bond with the Child in her absence. Instead, the Mother had insisted that Mother had to be in all the sessions notwithstanding the Father’s objections[^6].

14     The Mother, on the other hand, had asserted that the failure of the DSSA sessions was because the Father was manipulating the counsellor and had mislead the Court that one of the counsellors confirmed that Supervised Exchange will be recommended when this was not the case[^7]. The Mother has also stated that the Father had taken videos of herself and the DSSA counsellor on multiple occasions, which was a clear violation of the DSSA program.[^8] The Mother had expressed unhappiness with the counsellor’s handling of the access sessions and the objectivity of the counsellor in providing their report to the Court.

15     It soon became clear that the DSSA staff was no longer able to manage the acrimony (which includes allegations by the Parties against each other, and subsequently, against the DSSA) between the Parties.

16     In view of the DSSA’s inability to cope with the acrimony, the Court had to step in to manage the conflict between the parties with regular case conferences to monitor the access arrangements while waiting for the outcome of the CER report, especially when the Child is only two years old.

## Case Conference 22 January 2019

17     At the case conference of 22 January 2019, parties had agreed to an interim consent order, pending the outcome of the CER, that the Father shall have supervised access to the Child in a public place at xxx Library, on every Sunday, with effect from 27 January 2019, from 2 pm to 430 pm. Both parties agreed not to make any form of video recording during the access, but both parties agreed that photos could be taken during access. Both parties also agreed that none of the extended family should be present during access times, save for the Mother supervising the access. The parties had also agreed that if the Child is ill, the Mother shall give notice to the Father by 10am that day that the Child is unable to attend the access session and the Mother shall furnish a Medical Certificate (“MC”) to the Father. The Mother will then arrange with the Father for a make-up access session once the Child is well.

### Hearing of PPOs on 6 March 2019

18     After hearing the PPO application involving the parties and the Child on 6 March 2019, I had made changes to the interim order for access as the applications for PPO for the Child were dismissed.

19     After hearing the parties, I had made an interim order that the Father shall have supervised access to the Child every Saturday from 5 pm to 8 pm at xxx Road (which is the Mother’s Father’s residence as the Mother had confirmed that her Father was agreeable to the Father entering his residence), and on Sundays from 2 pm to 4.30 pm at any public place of the Father’s choice. I had also fixed a review of the access arrangements fixed on 26 March 2.30 pm.

20     The Mother wrote an email to the Court on the next day, on 7 March 2019, to indicate that she wanted the access on Saturdays to be at the matrimonial home which she had moved out of since December 2017, as her parents were not agreeable for access to take place at their home. There was no agreement on this arrangement by the Father. This led to further dispute between the parties as to where the access should take place.

## Case Conference- 26 March 2019

21     At the review of 26 March 2019, the Mother had requested that access should be supervised by her helper, Mdm C. I was open to the idea that Mdm C could be present to facilitate the access as her presence would be helpful while the Child bonds with the Father. This is to work towards an arrangement where Father should be given time to bond with the child in the absence of the Mother or her helper.

22     I had therefore ordered that the Father shall have supervised access to the Child with effect from 28 March 2019 on Thursday nights from 630 pm to 830 pm and on Saturdays from 1 pm to 330 pm, with only Mdm C present during access times, so that the Child will be given more time to familiarise herself with the Father. This was to facilitate more time for bonding between father and daughter before an eventual order for unsupervised access was to take place.

23     I had ordered that with effect of 11 April 2019, the Father shall have unsupervised access to the Child during the above timings. The Father shall pick the child up at xxx Road and return the Child at the same address, without the need of Mdm C to be present. I had also ordered that if the Child is ill and is unable to go for access, the Mother will produce a copy of the MC showing that the Child is ill and will arrange for a make-up session with the Father on another day.

24     Unfortunately, on 8 April 2019, the Father’s counsel made a request for an urgent case conference to be fixed, as there was an incident of conflict on 6 April 2019 between the parties while the Father was trying to exercise access. This incident of alleged family violence occurred in the presence of the Child and the extended family, which gave rise to multiple PPO applications filed, with allegations that there was a breach of the access orders made on 26 March 2019. The police were alerted over the incident.

## Case Conference- 12 April 2019

25     At the case conference on 12 April 2019, the Father’s counsel informed the Court that during the access on 31 March 2019, the Mother’s Father, Mr D, had gotten into the Father’s car together with the helper. The Father did not make an issue out of it as he wanted access to the Child. On the 4th of April, Mr D, the Mother and Mdm C went along to supervise the access to the Child.

26     On 6 April 2019, when the Father arrived to pick up the Child, the conflict broke out, with both parties painting a different picture of what had transpired on that day. The Father claimed that the Mother and Mr D wanted to enter the car, while the Father objected to their coming along for access. The Mother’s version was that the Father’s mother was in the car on 6 April 2019 and that the Father’s mother was unable to comfort the Child and that the Father had prevented Mdm C from entering the car.

27     The Father’s counsel had also informed the Court at the case conference that unsupervised access was supposed to have started on 11 April 2019, but the Mother had informed them that the Child was not feeling well and had denied the Father access. The Mother stated that the Child was ill and was on MC for 3 days.

28     I had reiterated my view that the Father must be given a chance to bond with the Child on an unsupervised basis and the orders must be made to work towards that. However, I still considered the Mother’s concerns and made orders for supervised access with Mdm C present, on 13 April 2019 from 1 pm to 3.30 pm, 18 April 2019 from 6.30 pm to 8.30 pm, and 20 April 2019, 1 pm to 3.30 pm. The Father was to pick the child up at the Toast Box Entrance at xxx and no other parties were to be present during the times of access save for Mdm C. I had fixed the next review on 23 April 2019.

## Case Conference- 23 April 2019

29     At the case conference of 23 April 2019, I had made orders for the Father to be granted unsupervised access on Saturdays from 1 pm to 3.30 pm, and on Thursdays from 6.30 pm to 8.30 pm, with effect from 25 April 2019. The Father was to pick the Child up from the Toast Box Entrance at xxx. The Father will return the Child at the same location. Mdm C will assist during the transfer of access, and the Father’s helper will be present at the transfer of access to assist him when the Child is in the car. If the Father needed any assistance from Mdm C, he shall call Mdm C on the mobile for assistance and make the necessary arrangements. The next review was then fixed on 7 May 2019.

## Case Conference 7 May 2019

30     At the case conference on 7 May 2019, the Father’s counsel informed the Court that the unsupervised access on 25 April 2019 went well with no issues. However, on 27 April 2019 (Saturday), the Child was unable to go for access as the Mother had informed the Father that the Child had an MC. The Father’s counsel also informed the Court that the Mother had informed the Father on 2 May 2019 that she was not going to send the Child as she was not going to allow unsupervised access to the Child. The Mother’s counsel explained that the Mother was not giving access as the Child was crying.

31     After hearing the parties, I had ordered the current arrangement for unsupervised access on Saturdays (1 pm to 3.30 pm) and Thursdays (6.30 pm to 8.30 pm) to continue, despite the objections from the Mother’s counsel that there should not be unsupervised access.

32     The Mother’s counsel wrote to the Court on 11 May 2019 asking for an urgent case conference as the Mother claimed that the current unsupervised access arrangement was not working out[^9].

## Case Conference - 15 May 2019

33     At the case conference on 15 May 2019, the Mother’s counsel said the Mother was asking for only supervised access to be granted and that the Mother insisted that she had to go along for the access. The Father’s counsel stated that on the 9th of May and 11th of May 2019, the Father only got supervised access as the Mother and Mdm C went along for access, even though the Mother was not supposed to do so.

34     After hearing the parties, I had repeated to the Parties that my current order for unsupervised access on Saturdays 1 pm to 3.30 pm and Thursdays 6.30 pm to 8.30 pm remained. I had also fixed a review on 18 June 2019 2.30 pm, besides fixing the OSG applications to be heard on 12 July 2019. I had explained to the parties that the Father must be given a chance to bond with the Child without the presence of the other parent or her agents. It cannot be that a Father has to be deprived of quality time to bond with his Child simply because the Mother asserted that the Child cries.

35     The Mother was dissatisfied with my interim orders for unsupervised access and filed an appeal (RASxxx/2019) on 29 May 2019 against those orders. This appeal was filed despite the Mother knowing that I will be hearing parties on the OSG applications on 12 July 2019 and will be making orders on the same. The Mother withdrew her appeal on 30 July 2019, with costs of $750 ordered against the Mother at the Pre Trial Conference by Assistant Registrar Nicole Loh.

## Case Conference - 18 June 2019

36     At the case conference of 18 June 2019, I had reiterated that until the actual hearing of the OSG applications, the interim order still remained.

## Summons for Leave to Commence Committal Proceedings (SUMxxx/2019)

37     The Father filed the above summons on 21 June 2019 stating in his affidavit in support that the Mother had denied him unsupervised access to the child despite orders for such access.

### Divorce Proceedings

38     In the meantime, the Father had filed a Writ for Divorce (Dxxx/2019) on 24 January 2019 and an Interim Judgment was granted on 21 June 2019, on an uncontested basis. The ancillary matters have been adjourned to be heard in Chambers.

## Hearing of OSG applications on 12 July 2019

## Mother’s Submissions

39     According to the Mother, she has offered the Father “many options for access including meeting the Child in a public place with the Helper G or (the Father’s) Aunty F”[^10] since she moved out of the matrimonial home on 25 December 2017. The Mother also stated that her Mother and the Helper will continue to care for the Child during the daytime and she will continue to care for the Child after work[^11]. According to the Mother, she is asking for sole custody care and control of the Child, with supervised access to the Father[^12], as she is the main caregiver of the child[^13]. The Mother’s counsel submitted that there are authorities that the care and control of a young infant should go to the Mother[^14] although he did not furnish any authorities on the day of hearing to support the same. The Mother’s counsel had also submitted that only supervised access should be ordered as unsupervised access was not working out[^15]. The Mother’s counsel had asked for supervised access to continue for another three to six months[^16] while highlighting to the Court that the Child was not comfortable to be with Father in the absence of Mother[^17]. The Mother’s counsel has informed the Court that Mdm C is not willing to go for the supervised sessions and has suggested the attendance of the Mother’s father, or the Mother’s mother[^18], to supervise the access[^19]. The Mother’s counsel had also requested the pick-up of the access to be at xxx Community Centre or Club[^20], near to where the Mother was currently staying.

40     On the Father’s request for shared care and control, the Mother’s counsel highlighted the case of _TAU v TAT <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHCF 11</span>_, to support the Mother’s submission that shared care and control is only possible where parties can co-operate with one another. It is clear that parties are unable to work with one another, having been embroiled with at least 10 PPO applications[^21] between them and the extended family. The Mother’s counsel had argued that a parent’s involvement in a child’s life can be served through joint custody[^22].

## Father’s Submissions

41     At the time of the hearing, the Father’s Counsel has indicated that the Father was asking for joint custody to be granted[^23], with shared care and control awarded to both parents. The Father’s counsel highlighted that while three sets of orders for DSSA were made, the DSSA were no longer able to assist the parties as the immense acrimony between the parties were beyond the DSSA’s control.[^24] The Father’s counsel added that since 15 May 2019 to the date of the hearing, the Father has never had the opportunity to have unsupervised access time to bond with the Child[^25]. While the Court had granted unsupervised access to the Father, the Father still allowed the Mother come along and did not insist on his rights because he wanted to see the Child. The Father has argued that it was the Mother who is uncomfortable with leaving the child with the Father, but, not the Child[^26].

42     The Father’s Counsel had proposed an arrangement that while the Father would accept an arrangement where care and control be given to the Mother, the Father would like access to be continuous, with access for two or three nights[^27], to give the Child a chance to bond with her Father and to get to know the Father’s family members[^28]. The hand-over should only be done by the Mother and other family members should not be involved[^29], including the Helper, given the history between the parties. The Father has stated that his parents and a helper will look after the Child while he was at work[^30].

43     On the issue of shared care and control, the Father’s counsel did state that parties have to be amicable[^31] for shared care and control to work out. However, the Father’s counsel has submitted that parties are able to “be nice to one another” and “just that the intervention of extended family members are the ones who is causing all of this problem”[^32].

## Orders Made

44     After hearing the parties on 12 July 2019 for both applications, I made the following orders:

> “1.     Parties shall have joint custody of the child of the marriage, B (Birth Certificate No. xxx) (“the said child”).

> 2.     The Mother shall have care and control of the said Child.

> 3.     The Father shall have liberal access to the said Child, as follows:-

>> a.       From 1 August 2019 onwards, the Father shall have unsupervised access to the said Child on Thursdays from 2.00 pm to 7.00 pm, Fridays from 2.00 pm to 7.00 pm, Saturdays from 9.00 am to 2.00 pm.

>> b.       From 15 August 2019 onwards, the Father shall have unsupervised access to the said Child on Thursdays from 9.00am to 7.00pm, Fridays from 9.00am to 7.00pm and Saturdays from 9.00am to 7.00pm.

>> c.       From 5 September 2019 onwards, the Father shall have unsupervised access to the said Child on Thursdays from 9.00am to Saturdays 7.00pm (overnight access inclusive).

> 4.     There shall be supervised exchange (one way) at a Private Counsellor’s Office. The Private Counsellor shall report to the Family Justice Courts in ten (10 weeks) after the supervised exchange begins from 1 August 2019 onwards.

> 5.     During the supervised exchange at the Private Counsellor’s Office, only the Father and the Mother shall be present. No other family member shall be present at the supervised exchange.

> 6.     Parties shall share the costs of engaging the Private Counsellor on an equal basis.

> 7.     Unless the Child is hospitalised, the Father shall continue to have access to the Child.

> 8.     The return of the said Child shall take place at the xxx Community Centre[^33].

> 9.     Parties are to attend co-parenting counselling conducted by the Private Counsellor.

> 10.     There shall be a review to be fixed by the Family Justice Courts when the report from the Private Counsellor is ready.

45     I did not make any orders on the issue of maintenance as the Mother had filed a separate application in MSSxxx/2018 for the maintenance of herself and the Child, and the parties’ evidence on the issue of maintenance was more complete in the affidavits that they had filed in MSSxxx/2018[^34]. I had therefore made no orders on maintenance at the OSG application and will make the maintenance orders after hearing parties on MSSxxx/2018.

46     The Mother has filed a Notice of Appeal on 22 July 2019 and has appealed against part of my decision as follows:

> “1.     That \[the Father\] shall have unsupervised access to the child.

> 2.     That with effect from 15 August 2019 the day of access of the Child shall be from Thursday to Saturday from 9.00 am to 7.00 pm.

> 3.     That there is overnight access to the child with effect from 05 September 2019.

> 4.     That in the event the Child is sick unless hospitalised the said access of the Child to \[the Father\] is to continue.”

47     I will now give my reasons for my decision.

## The Law

48     The parties have applied under Section 5 of the Guardianship of Infants Act (Cap 122, 1985 Rev Ed) (“GIA”) for the Court to make an order for custody care and control and access pending their divorce. It is trite law that in deciding custody and upbringing issues that the Court must regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration, pursuant to Section 3 of the GIA.

## Custody

49     The Court of Appeal had stated determinatively in _CX v CY <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGCA 37</span>_ (“_CX v CY_”) that in any custody proceedings, “the idea of joint parental responsibility is deeply rooted in our family law jurisprudence” and that “(t)here can be no doubt that the welfare of a child is best secured by letting him enjoy the love, care and support of both parents. The needs of a child do not change simply because his parents no longer live together. Thus, in any custody proceedings, it is crucial that the courts recognise and promote joint parenting so that both parents can continue to have a direct involvement in the child’s life” (at \[26\]).

50     The Court of Appeal in _CX v CY_ had agreed that a joint custody order should be made in that case because of the symbolism of such an order “may be used to remind the mother that the father has an equal say in more significant matters concerning the child’s upbringing.” (at \[20\]).

51     The Mother’s gatekeeping posture in these proceedings, including her insistence on sole custody and her repeated attempts to ensure that only supervised access be given to the Father have persuaded me that a joint custody order must be made. Even as I am inclined to grant the Mother care and control as I am satisfied that the Mother is the main caregiver of the Child, I find it necessary to make a joint custody order to send a signal to the Mother that she has to co-operate with the Father. With the grant of a joint custody order, the likelihood of the non-custodial parent being excluded from the Child’s life is significantly reduced. It is pertinent to note that even the Mother’s counsel has conceded at the hearing that joint custody is always encouraged[^35].

52     The Mother’s strong gatekeeping behaviour has surfaced for the past few months since the interim orders were granted, pending the outcome of the CER. Examples of such behaviour included her insistence that access to the Father must be supervised without being able to furnish any substantive reasons as to why access to the Father must be supervised, her intrusion into Father’s access time with Child and multiple breaches of the court ordered access sessions. Should the Court condone the Mother’s strong gatekeeping behaviour, the Mother will be impeding the formation of the young Child’s relationship with her father as the Child will never have a chance to spend quality time with her Father. This gatekeeping behaviour must be arrested early. The relationship with Father and Child may deteriorate with the Mother’s lack of genuine support for the father-child relationship.

## Care and control

53     The Father has requested for a shared care and control arrangement. I did not make an order for shared care and control as it is not feasible. In the case of _AQL v AQM <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGHC 264</span> (“AQL v AQM”)_, the High Court had dismissed the Husband’s appeal for shared care and control for primarily three reasons:

> \-    First, there was no reason to doubt that the mother could discharge her parental duties capably;

> \-    Secondly, the child who was 3 years old (in that case) was too young for a shared care and control arrangement. In this regard, the High Court opined that young children require a familiar and secure base-camp and uprooting a young child will be overly disruptive;

> \-    In that case, parties have markedly different ideas on how to bring up the child. A strong clash in parenting styles and parties’ seeming inability to compromise were relevant considerations.

54     In our case, the Child is even younger than the child in _AQL v AQM_. It is also obvious that parties before me have very different ideas on how to bring up the Child and the inability to compromise is apparent.

55     In the case of _TAU v TAT[^36]_, Justice Debbie Ong had reiterated that in making orders on care and control and access, the focus is always on the child’s welfare and not in the interests or wishes of either parent if they do not serve the child’s welfare. Justice Ong had opined that the apportioning of time needed to take into account the Child’s developmental needs at that particular stage of life. Shared care and control is not feasible and not in the interest of the young Child as it will be too disruptive to the constancy of routine that a young Child requires. The clear animosity between the Parties would also deepen the sense of disruption. I am of the view that the Child’s interests will be best served by awarding sole care and control to one parent.  That will allow the Child a certain measure of stability in her development while her parents learn to co-parent her.

## Access

56     I will therefore order joint custody to both parents, with care and control to be granted to Mother. However, I will grant liberal unsupervised access, including overnight access, in stages as I found no evidence that the Father would not be able to care for the Child in the absence of the mother. The Father must be given quality time to spend with the Child even though I did not grant shared care and control to the Father. I had emphasized to the Parties that if the Mother’s gatekeeping behaviour continued by denying access, I may consider reversing the care and control order which will result in sole care and control in favour of the Father if that would offer more stability to the Child without depriving her of time to bond with both parents.

57     I had observed during the stage of interim access orders that the Child’s regularity of access was frequently disrupted by being covered by an MC. While I am not questioning the validity of the MCs, I am concerned with how an extended deprivation of access to the Father and a consequent change in routine may confuse the young Child. Due to the frequency of incidents where the Child did not attend access because she was on MC, the Father had requested at the case conference for the Court to look into the validity of the MCs, which the Court is certainly not in a position to do so. I have therefore ordered that Child must go for access unless the Child is hospitalized. Even if the Child has taken ill, the Child can still go for access- especially when both parents are medical doctors. If the Child is ill when the Father has access, he can bring the Child to the doctor and tend to the Child. This will facilitate true co-parenting between both parents as it cannot be that the Mother should have to shoulder the entire responsibility of taking care of the Child when she is ill when both parents can start to communicate with each other on how to nurse the Child back to health.

58     I am mindful that the Child is still young and I will therefore increase the access to the Father in stages, working towards unsupervised access with overnight access in due course, with eventual access to be from Thursday 9am to Saturday 7pm, with the Child spending two nights with the Father from Thursday night and Friday night. This is workable as the Child has yet to commence any formal education. This is to give the Father quality time to spend with the Child, as well as for the Child to get to bond with the Father’s family members.

59     In view of the challenges faced by the Father in getting access during the interim period, I am of the view that a supervised one-way exchange must take place. However, as parties were not able to work with the DSSA, I have made an order for a one-way supervised exchange to take place at a private counsellor’s office, with the parties choosing who this Private Counsellor should be. I will order the Father to return the Child at the xxx Community Club as per the request by the Mother’s counsel in his submissions at hearing.

60     Parties should also attend before the Private Counsellor to help them work out their co-parenting skills. In view of the young age of the Child, I will fix a review of these access orders once a report from the Private Counsellor is sent to the Court.

61     The access will be implemented in the following phases:

> “With effect from 1st August.

> The Father will have unsupervised day access with Child on weekdays after lunch from Thursday and Friday (2 pm to 7 pm (after dinner)) and weekend access on Saturday from 9 am (after breakfast) to 2 pm (after lunch).

> One- way supervised exchange (from Mother to Father) shall take place at the Private Counsellor to be chosen by parties and appointed by the court, with costs to be shared equally between parties. Parties should exchange proposals to agree on a private counsellor. If parties cannot agree, Parties to suggest three names each and the Court will select and appoint one. Parties to attend co-parenting counselling and the private counsellor to furnish a report on the one-way supervised exchange.

> Grandparents and helper not to be physically present or involved in the exchange process. Handover of Child is strictly to be between parents and not left to the Private Counsellor. Unless Child is hospitalised, the Mother on her own, sends the Child to the Private Counsellor where she will be personally picked by Father alone.

> Unless Child is hospitalised, the Father, on his own, sends Child to the xxx Community Club where she will be picked up personally by Mother alone.

> With effect from 15th August

> The Father shall be given unsupervised day access with the Child on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 9 am (after breakfast) to 7 pm. A one-way supervised exchange shall take place at the Private Counsellor’s office.

> With effect from 5 September

> The Father shall be given unsupervised day access with Child on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 9 am (after breakfast) to 7 pm (after dinner). In addition, the Father shall also be given unsupervised overnight access to the Child from Friday 7 pm to Saturday morning 9 am (after breakfast).

> With effect from 19 September

> The Father shall be given unsupervised day access with Child on Thursdays to Saturdays from 9 am (after breakfast) to 7 pm (after dinner).The Father shall also be given unsupervised overnight access to Child from Thursday 7 pm (after dinner) to Saturday morning 9 am (after breakfast) (_meaning access will be from Thursday 9 am to Saturday 7 pm, with the Child spending two nights of overnight access with the Father from Thursday night and Friday night_).

> Parents are to attend co-parenting counselling with the private counsellor

> A review to be held in 10 weeks, for private counsellor to prepare to submit a report on access arrangements.”

62     A hearing was fixed on 16 July 2019 for parties to update the Court on appointment of Private Counsellor. Both parties were ordered to bear their own costs in order not to further the acrimony between them.

63     The Court should always be the last resort to resolve parental disputes. It is not in the Child’s welfare for her parents to have to come to Court repeatedly to resolve their differences. The 2-year old Child still has a long way to adulthood and the above orders were made in the hope that it will help both parents guide her on this journey. The parties have the power to decide what her childhood will be. Will it be one that is filled with fear and bitterness, seeing adults fight over her during access sessions, or will it be a life basking in security knowing she has parents who love her enough to look beyond their own differences and start to work with one another, because they want what is truly best for her? This is something that only the parents themselves can decide.
