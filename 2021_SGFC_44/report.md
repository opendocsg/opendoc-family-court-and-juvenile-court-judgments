Family Law – Maintenance – Division of Matrimonial Assets

27 April 2021

### District Judge Wendy Yu:

## Introduction

1       The parties dissolved their marriage though an Interim Judgment granted on 1 April 2019 on the ground that the marriage had broken down irretrievably. The husband (hereinafter referred to as “the Plaintiff”) filed the Writ for Divorce on 26 September 2018 on the basis of the Wife’s unreasonable behaviour and the Wife (hereinafter referred to as “the Defendant”) filed a Defence and Counterclaim on 27 November 2018 on the basis of the Plaintiff’s unreasonable behaviour. The writ was eventually resolved on an uncontested basis when leave was granted to the Defendant to withdraw her Defence, leading to the grant of the Interim Judgment on the unreasonable behaviour of the respective parties.

2       The parties were married in 2003 and they have one daughter, \[Child 1\], who was born in 2009[^1].

3       Parties had entered into a Consent Order on 21 April 2020 and agreed to the joint custody of \[Child 1\], with care and control to the Defendant and reasonable access to the Plaintiff. This was therefore no longer an issue that required the Court to determine at the ancillary hearing.

4       The ancillary issues that remained to be adjudicated were:

> (a)     The Defendant’s claim for maintenance;

> (b)     Maintenance for \[Child 1\];

> (c)     Division of the matrimonial assets, and

> (d)     The costs of the proceedings.

5       I had heard the parties on 2 December 2020 and I made final orders on the ancillary matters on 20 January 2021, as follows:

> (a)     The Plaintiff is to transfer his share of the Housing and Development Board flat at \[Property 2\] (“the 2nd Matrimonial Flat”) to the Defendant with no cash consideration and no CPF refund, within six (6) months from the date of this order. The Defendant shall bear the costs and expenses of the transfer. The Defendant shall also be solely responsible for paying off the mortgage loan that remains on the 2nd Matrimonial Flat in future.

> (b)     The Housing and Development at \[Property 1\] ("1st Matrimonial Flat”) is to be sold in the open market within six (6) months from the date of the Final Judgment. The proceeds from the sale of the 1st matrimonial flat shall be used to pay the outstanding mortgage loan and the cost and expenses of sale. The Defendant shall be entitled to $286,752.00 of the sale proceeds, while the Plaintiff shall be entitled to the remainder of the balance sale proceeds. Each party is to refund their respective CPF accounts for monies utilised in the purchase of the 1st Matrimonial Flat together with accrued interest from their own share of the balance sale proceeds.

> (c)     For the property in Malaysia at \[Property 3\], the parties shall take steps to facilitate the surrender of the purchase and should there be any liabilities that rise from such surrender, parties are to shoulder the liabilities jointly.

> (d)     Each party to retain all other assets in their sole names.

> (e)     There shall be no maintenance for the Defendant.

> (f)     The Plaintiff shall continue to pay maintenance of $1,200 per month for the child, \[Child 1\] with effect from 31 January 2021 and thereafter on the last day of each month into the Defendant’s POSB Bank Savings Account No. 171-XXX.

> (g)     Each party to bear their own legal costs.

> (h)     Liberty to apply.

6       The Plaintiff filed an appeal against the entirety of the ancillary orders, while the Defendant filed an appeal against my order for maintenance of \[Child 1\] and my order of no maintenance for the Defendant. I now set out the grounds for my decision.

## Facts of this case

7       The Plaintiff is 45 years old and a Senior Black Belt with \[S\].[^2]

8       The Defendant is 42 years old and a part time accountant with \[H\][^3]. The Defendant also earned additional income from selling handbags on Carousell.[^4] The Defendant is a Chinese National who had resided in Shanghai before she married the Plaintiff.[^5]

## Issues (a) and (b) - the Defendant’s maintenance & child’s maintenance

#### The Plaintiff’s position

9       As a matter of background, the Defendant had made an application[^6] for interim maintenance and I had ordered on 28 August 2019 for the Plaintiff to pay interim maintenance of $1,200 per month for \[Child 1\], and interim maintenance of $800 per month for the Defendant. There was no appeal against this interim order.

10     The Plaintiff has submitted that the Defendant should not receive any further maintenance as her current monthly gross wage is $2,700.00 a month, which was a material change since the interim maintenance of $800.00 was ordered on 28 August 2019 when her gross wage back in 2019 was $1,500.00 per month[^7]. In addition to her salary as a part-time accountant, she also had income from selling handbags online with Carousell.[^8] The Plaintiff also highlighted that the Defendant’s earning capacity in that the Defendant had teaching experience at \[T\] School and gave private Chinese tuition in the past[^9].

11     The Plaintiff also contended that the Defendant’s proposed list of expenses were unsubstantiated and with the Defendant receiving a significant amount from the pool of the matrimonial assets she no longer needed maintenance from the Plaintiff.[^10]

12     On the issue of \[Child 1\]’s maintenance, the Plaintiff has submitted that the Court should order the same amount of $1,200.00 as ordered in the interim application.[^11] The Plaintiff has argued that the Defendant’s monthly income has increased since the interim order for maintenance was made. The Plaintiff also added that the Defendant was inflating \[Child 1\]’s expenses when she now claims that \[Child 1\]’s current expenses is $5,211.63 while it was $4,506.10 back in 2019[^12], with the Defendant enrolling \[Child 1\] for various enrichment classes without seeking the Plaintiff’s consent.

#### The Defendant’s position

13     The Defendant declared her current monthly maintenance to be $4,593.58, excluding the monthly rental expenses of $2,500.00 if she has to move out of the matrimonial home.[^13] The Defendant also averred that her earning capacity has been impaired because of the Plaintiff’s physical abuse.[^14] While there was an interim maintenance order for the Plaintiff to pay the Defendant a sum of $800.00 as maintenance, the Defendant stated that the accommodation related expenses such as mortgage instalments, utility bills and property tax were borne by the Plaintiff when this interim order was made. The Defendant then submitted that she expects that there will be additional accommodation related expenses that she would have to bear and so she should be awarded with more maintenance. [^15]

14     The Defendant acknowledged that she was earning a monthly gross salary of $4,200.00 at the peak of her career pursuits but she has had difficulty finding work since 2018 because of her inability to stay seated for an extended period of time.[^16] The Defendant also added that her current income as a part -time accountant of $1,200.00 to $2,160.00 represents the “best case scenario”[^17] for her and has requested that the Court order the Plaintiff to pay her a monthly sum of $2,050.00 as spousal maintenance. The Defendant has cited the case of _Foo Ah Yan v Chiam Heng Chow_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGCA 15</span> to reinforce her point that the guiding principle of financial preservation required the wife to be maintained at a standard which should reasonably commensurate with the standard of living enjoyed during the marriage.

15     On the issue of child maintenance, the Defendant submitted that \[Child 1\]’s current monthly expenses amount to $5,121.63[^18], although the Defendant had stated \[Child 1\]’s monthly average expenses to be $2,817.22 per month[^19] over the course of July and August 2020. According to the Defendant, \[Child 1\]’s additional tuition and enrichment expenses are necessary to give her the opportunity to develop her artistic passion and talents[^20].

## Decision on maintenance

## Maintenance for Defendant

16     Section 114(1) of the Women’s Charter sets out the factors that the Court may take into consideration in deciding the award of maintenance for the wife. The Court of Appeal in the case of _TNL v TNK_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 15</span> (“_TNL v TNK”)_ has at \[62\] stated that the award of maintenance is a “multi-factorial inquiry” which requires the Court to have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the matters listed in ss114(1)(a) to 114(1)(g) of the Women’s Charter.

17     Since the interim order of maintenance, the Defendant has had an increase in salary with a take home pay of $2,160.[^21] This income is in addition to her other income from selling handbags in Carousell.[^22] The Defendant is a resourceful individual who had, in her own words, managed to amass “significant savings”[^23] from selling branded handbags online such that she could use these funds to purchase properties in China. The Defendant also has had teaching experience at \[T\] School and gave private Chinese tuition in the past[^24].

18     I considered her expenses that she now claims to be $4,593.58 per month to be inflated. She has stated that her own expenses in July 2020 and August 2020 to be an average of $986.78[^25], which seems to be a more realistic figure. In her current claim, she has included an allowance of $1,000.00 for her own parents, $350.00 for her parent’s health supplements and $110.00 for a house cleaner. Her personal expenses such as cosmetics and skincare, health tonics, grooming, clothing and shoes, recreation and entertainment, overseas vacation, travel expenses to China amount to at least $1,516.00 per month and some of these are not necessities. There is also no evidence that she travels overseas on a monthly basis and even if the figures given by the Defendant were on a pro-rated basis, there is no evidence to substantiate the figures. I would say that her reasonable expenses are in the region of $1,000.00 to $1,500.00 and these expenses can be met with her income as she is financially independent. She will also not be incurring another $2,500.00 for rent since I have ordered the matrimonial property flat at \[Property 2\] (“the 2nd Matrimonial Flat”) to be transferred to her.

19     An order for maintenance for a former spouse has been regarded as supplementary to an order to divide the matrimonial assets of the parties as it is intended to take care of any residual inequality in their financial resources after the matrimonial assets have been divided (see _ATE v ATD and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGCA 2</span> (“_ATE v ATD”)_ at \[33\]). The Court in _TNL v TNK_ had reiterated at \[63\] the approach adopted in _ATE v ATD[^26]_ that if a wife has already received a substantial sum from the division of matrimonial assets which, “if invested properly, would be sufficient to maintain” her, then the award of maintenance to the wife should not be more than what is necessary to allow her to “weather the transition of the divorce”. Nominal maintenance for the wife is not awarded automatically or as a matter of course. In the present case, given that the Defendant is now financially independent and taking into account that she has been awarded a generous sum from the division of matrimonial assets (which includes properties in China and in Singapore which would significantly enhance her financial standing to generate more income for herself), I was not minded to order any maintenance for her.

## Maintenance for \[Child 1\]

20     I had previously made an order for $1,200.00 per month as \[Child 1\]’s interim maintenance. The Defendant had previously stated that \[Child 1\]’s monthly average expenses is $2,817.22 per month[^27] over the course of July and August 2020, but had subsequently revised that figure to $5,121.63 per month, which I am of the view that it is inflated for a primary school child. The figure of $5,121.63 includes items of $567.00 for meals outside, $485.00 for food and groceries, $2,001.03 for private tuition/enrichment, $550.00 for overseas vacation and $316.66 for travel to China. I am of the view that \[Child 1\]’s reasonable expenses are in the region of $2,000 to $2,400 per month, and the maintenance of $1,200 that I had ordered from the Plaintiff would cover his share of the maintenance, since both parents have a statutory duty to maintain the child pursuant to s. 68 of the Women’s Charter. In the circumstances, I ordered the Plaintiff to continue paying the Defendant a monthly sum of $1,200.00 for the maintenance of \[Child 1\].

## Issue (c) - Division of Matrimonial Assets

#### Length of marriage; general observations

21     The parties married in 2003 and Interim Judgment was granted in 2019. The marriage lasted for nearly 16 years. During the marriage, the Defendant said she was the primary caregiver for the child[^28]. Although the Plaintiff was the primary breadwinner during the marriage and was earning more than the Defendant, the Defendant worked as well and was a part-time accountant besides selling bags online. This was this a dual income marriage.

#### Parties’ positions on the Matrimonial Assets

22     With these observations, I set out the parties’ positions on the matrimonial assets (MA). The parties had submitted a Joint Table of Summary setting out their respective positions on the pool of MA at the hearing on 2 December 202 and I had marked this table as “JTS-1” and reproduced it below. For ease of reference, I have also included the Court’s remarks on parties’ positions at the hearing and the consequent directions made as well, as follows:

## Decision on division of MA

#### Operative date

23     Regarding the valuation of these assets, the Court of Appeal had reiterated that generally, once an asset is regarded as a MA, it ought to be valued as at the date of the ancillary matters, unless a departure is warranted by the facts (_TND v TNC and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 34</span> (“_TND v TNC_”) at \[19\], commenting on _TDT v TDS and another appeal and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 145</span> at \[50\]). Nevertheless, where parties agree that a particular date should be used as the date of valuation of the MA, a Court should generally adopt that agreed date unless there is good reason not to do so (_TND v TNC_ at \[24\]).

#### Approach

24     Section 112(1) of the Women’s Charter empowers the Court when granting or subsequent to the grant of a judgment or divorce to order the division between the parties of any matrimonial asset or the sale of any such asset and the division between the parties of the proceeds of the sale of any such asset in such proportions as the Court thinks _just and equitable._ The guiding principles of exercising this power are set out in s. 112(2) of the Women’s Charter. The Court of Appeal in _ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span> (_“ANJ v ANK”)_ has set out a structured approach (at \[17\] – \[30\]) to determine a just and equitable division of matrimonial assets. This approach may be summarised as follows (see _ANJ v ANK_ at \[22\] – \[26\], \[28\]; _Twiss, Christopher James Hans v Twiss, Yvonne Prendergast_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGCA 52</span> (“_Twiss_”) at \[17\]):

> (a)     express as a ratio the parties’ direct contributions relative to each other, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets;

> (b)     express as a second ratio the parties’ indirect contributions relative to each other, having regard to both financial and non-financial contributions; and

> (c)     derive the parties’ overall contributions relative to each other by taking an average of the two ratios above (the derived ratio shall hereinafter be referred to as the “average ratio”), keeping in mind that, depending on the circumstances of each case, the direct and indirect contributions may not be accorded equal weight, and one of the two ratios may be accorded more significance than the other. Adjustments may also be made taking into consideration other relevant factors under ss 112 or 114(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“WC”).

25     Both parties agreed at the hearing[^34] that the global assessment methodology should be adopted in this case and I have used this methodology accordingly.

26     Applying the approach then of _ANJ v ANK_ as set out above, I determined the pool of MA (with their values) to be set forth as follows:

#### Preliminary Issues relating to the Pool of MA

27     Parties had sold the 1st Matrimonial Flat at $1,000,000.00, before the ancillary orders were made, and so I have used that figure as its value. For the 2nd Matrimonial Flat, it was valued at $1,080,000.00 at the joint valuation and I have used that figure as well. For the Malaysian property at The Peak, both parties agreed that there was no value to the property and so I have indicated that accordingly in the table above.

28     For the property in China, Hai Shang Jun, which was under the sole name of the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff had instructed a valuation to be conducted sometime on 7 September 2020 and provided the figure as $716,000.00[^68] while the Defendant conducted a valuation on or about 28 September 2020 and stated the valuation to be $780,000.00[^69]. In the Plaintiff’s submissions, he had disputed the legitimacy of the Defendant’s valuation by stating that the method used by his valuer being the Market Comparison Method should be adopted instead of the Defendant’s valuation which used the Market Comparison Method and Income Approach[^70]. The Plaintiff had also proposed in his submissions that the Court direct another Joint Valuation through local agencies (e.g. Propnex, OrangeTee and ERA) who could liaise with third party valuation agents in China[^71]. The Defendant objected to this proposal[^72] as she had already spent a considerable sum of money to procure the current valuation report and insisted that her valuation is reliable and authentic. The Plaintiff then suggested at the hearing[^73] that parties be given leave to produce extrinsic evidence like websites to obtain valuations of the foreign properties.

29     Parties were also unable to agree to the valuation of the Milano Property in Shanghai, which was under the Defendant’s sole name. The Plaintiff’s valuer provided the figure of $720,000.00 while the Defendant’s valuer valued the Milano Property at $570,000.00[^74].

30     I was unable to agree with the Plaintiff’s submissions to appoint local agents to liaise with third party valuation agents in China and make parties incur more costs or delay the proceedings. I also did not accept the proposal to allow the use of websites to determine the value of the property. I was of the view that it would be just and equitable to adopt the average of the valuations provided by the Plaintiff and Defendant, especially when the use of average of two valuations has been accepted by the Court of Appeal in recent decision of _TQU v TQT_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 8</span>[^75], when there were differing valuations tendered by parties.

31     While I note that the Plaintiff has disputed the legitimacy of the Defendant’s valuation, there has not been any expert evidence showing that the Defendant’s valuation is inferior to that of the Plaintiff’s. Both appear to be formal valuation reports accepted by the country of origin (China) and both valuations are near enough to the AM date. On the Plaintiff’s submission that the Defendant’s valuation should not be adopted because they have combined the market comparative price and income approach while his valuer adopted the market comparative value, the Defendant’s valuer has explained clearly in the report why they have utilised the income approach and the market comparative approach[^76]:

> “….it is possible to use the comparison method of appraisal, the comparison method should be taken. It is possible to use the comparison method of appraisal, the comparison method should be taken as the main appraisal method and income approach should be chosen as one of the appraisal methods for profitable real estate. ….

> Since the appraisal object can be residential real estate, the preferred methods should be income approach and comparative method…. In addition to the accumulation cost, the market value also includes a large part of value-added income. This part of value-added income is difficult to accurately measure, and the value measured by the cost method cannot accurately reflect its real estate market value, so the cost method is not used. Since the real estate market is similar to Appraisal object and there are many cases of appraisal transaction, we can adopt the comparative method. Also, the appraisal object has relatively stable future economic income, and its operating cost information is easy to collect and grasp, or income approach can be adopted. Therefore this appraisal adopts the comparative method and income approach to carry out the assessment. According to the Appraisal results of the two methods, through comprehensive analysis, we finally determine the market value of Appraisal object real estate market…..”.

32     The Defendant’s valuer has stated that “the results of the above two appraisal methods are comprehensively analysed and the two results are comprehensively analysed and evaluated by appropriate methods and the market value of the real estate market is finally determined”. I am of the view that the Defendant’s valuer has sufficiently explained the basis of the valuation and unless there is evidence that this is not an accepted method of valuation in China, I am not persuaded by the Plaintiff’s submission that his valuation is to be preferred to that of the Defendant’s. There is no evidence before me that the Defendant’s valuer had adopted a method which is wholly inappropriate or patently wrong for valuing a property in China.

33     Taking the average of the valuation of the respective parties for both properties, I have adopted the value of Hai Shang Jun as $748,000.00 and Milano Property as $645,000.00.

#### On the $290,000 “loan” that the Plaintiff wants to be deducted from the MA

34     The Plaintiff has submitted that the $290,000.00 loan which he has taken from his family to purchase from Hai Shang Jun should be deducted from the pool of MA. I am of the view that this figure should not be deducted because the Plaintiff has included this figure as part of his direct financial contributions for the Hai Shang Jun property and it will not be just and equitable for this to be deducted from the pool of MA. If the Plaintiff claims credit for this sum of $290,000 as his direct contributions, then he should also bear personal liability for it. Further, the Plaintiff has not provided any concrete evidence of his repayment efforts to each family member or the amount currently outstanding. The Plaintiff had claimed that $220,000.00 is a loan from his siblings and $70,000.00 is from his father[^77]. While the loan agreements exhibited[^78] in his affidavit show that the loans were taken in 2016, there is no evidence on how much of this loan has been repaid as at the date of the hearing. The Plaintiff also has not provided any evidence of a payment schedule. For example, in the statutory declaration signed by the Plaintiff’s father[^79], the Plaintiff’s father has stated that the loan of $70,000.00 given on 28 April 2016 remains as $70,000 as at 13 July 2017. For the reasons above, I did not deduct the sum of $290,000.00 from the pool of MA.

#### The Defendant’s direct contribution of $35,000 in April 2020 and June 2020 & the $80,000 payment to the Defendant’s Mother - should there be an adverse inference drawn against the Defendant?

35     The Plaintiff had requested that the Court draw an adverse inference against the Defendant[^80] for the sum of $80,000.00 that the Defendant had transferred to her mother in 2017 and 2018. According to the Plaintiff, there was no evidence provided by the Defendant that her mother needed such medical treatment and there was the question as to whether there was any undeclared beneficial interest of property in China[^81]. The Plaintiff had also submitted that the $80,000.00 should be included[^82] into the pool of MA.

36     The Defendant had, after the Interim Judgment was granted in April 2019, made two further lump sum payments - $15,000 on 16 April 2020 and $20,000 on 22 June 2020 to “pay down the housing loan”[^83] for the 1st Matrimonial Flat, with funds she says she obtained as a repayment from her mother. I did not include the $35,000 as her direct financial contribution as I did not want to encourage parties to make last minute payments into matrimonial assets in an attempt to increase their direct financial contributions. However, I have kept this as part of the $80,000.00 in her sole assets and ordered the return $35,000.00 to her from the proceeds in the order for division.

37     It was also only after the Defendant made this payment of $35,000.00 that she had disclosed that she had transferred $80,000.00 to her mother in 2017 to 2018 to pay for her Mother’s cancer treatment, medical treatment, and for a purchase of a property.[^84] The Defendant had provided evidence of remittance of funds to her mother on 24 January 2017 and 19 October 2017[^85].

38     The Defendant insisted that there was no dissipation because she did not want the divorce to happen at all[^86] and that the funds were transferred to her mother when “parties were still on good terms”[^87]. In order for the Court to draw an adverse inference, a necessary condition is that there must be a “substratum of evidence that establishes a _prima facie_ case against the person against whom the inference is to be drawn”: _UZN_ at \[18\], citing _BPC v BPB and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 1 SLR 608</span> (“_BPC_”) at \[60\]. Specifically, there must be a _prima facie_ case of _concealment_: _AZZ v BAA_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 44</span> at \[107\].

39     Having considered the parties’ submissions and the evidence before me, I do not find that the Plaintiff has shown that there is a substratum of evidence that gives rise to a _prima facie_ case of concealment against the Defendant. However, what I had to consider was whether this $80,000.00 should be included into the matrimonial pool and whether it was an amount which had been expended when divorce is imminent, which the Court of Appeal in _UZN v UZM_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 109</span> (“_UZN v UZM”)_ at \[65\] coined as “innocent” dissipation. This is a means of ensuring that the matrimonial pool reflects the material gains of the marriage by adding the values of certain assets into the pool on the basis that a party has expended substantial sums when divorce proceedings are imminent: _UZN v UZM_ at \[62\]. This is based on the _dicta_ in _TNL v TNK and another appeal and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 1 SLR 609</span> (“_TNL_”) at \[24\] (which the Court of Appeal referred to as the “_TNL dicta_”).

40     Even though the Defendant has explained that this is not dissipation because she did not want a divorce, I was of the view that the evidence showed that the monies were transferred out to her mother when divorce was imminent. While the Plaintiff only filed for divorce in September 2018, there is evidence of acrimony between the parties much earlier, in that the Defendant filed an application for a Personal Protection Order (“PPO”) and had already obtained a PPO against the Plaintiff on 3 January 2017. From the Defendant’s evidence, as at February 2017, she had referred to the Plaintiff as “Bad Man Ex Song”[^88]. The screenshots of messages sometime in 2017 and in January 2018 also showed the parties’ deteriorating relationship with discussion on divorce[^89], even though the parties travelled as a family in 2018. The Defendant had also exhibited a receipt of the former lawyer[^90] engaged by the Plaintiff to represent him for divorce proceedings in January 2018, besides exhibiting a transcript[^91] of an exchange between them about divorce and talking to the judge. There was also a screenshot of a message[^92] from the Plaintiff telling the Defendant to bring the marriage certificate and asking her to consider agreeing to an uncontested divorce and to respond by August 2017. It was clear that divorce was imminent when the $80,000 was transferred out and so this should put back into the pool.

#### Application of the ANJ Approach: Step 1: Direct Financial Contributions

41     In the first step of the “structured” approach, it requires the Court to consider the amount of financial contributions each party has made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets. This is where the Court must make a “rough and ready approximation” of the figures.

42     The Court of Appeal in _ANJ v ANK_ at \[23\] had stated:

> _“Even in respect of direct financial contributions of the parties, not infrequently, the situation is less than clear. In a case where the documentary evidence falls short of establishing exactly who made what contribution and/or the exact amount of monetary contribution made by each party, the court must make a “rough and ready approximation” of the figures (see NK v NL at \[28\]), citing Hoong Khai Soon v Cheng Kwee Eng (1993) 1 SLR(R)823 at \[17\] with approval). At the end of the day, the court would have to approach the issue by exercising sound judgment, having regard to the inherent veracity of each party’s version of events reflected in their affidavits or testimony as well as the documentary evidence. This is where “broad brush” comes in.”_

43     I will now set out my findings for the parties’ direct financial contributions as I make a “rough and ready approximation” of the figures, and state my findings below, while being mindful of the broad-brush approach.

### Issues on Disputed Items for Direct Financial Contributions

#### Renovations to 1st Matrimonial Flat

44     I was of the view that the evidence tendered by both Parties were insufficient and I was not convinced on a balance of probabilities that both Parties should receive full credit on the financial contributions that they are seeking on the 1st Matrimonial Flat. The Plaintiff claimed his financial contributions to the renovations of the 1st Matrimonial Flat to be $70,000[^101]. I did not accord any value for the Defendant’s financial contribution to the 1st Matrimonial Flat as she has stated her contributions to be “furniture from Taobao online purchase and Ikea”, “curtain, cushion covers, chairs and furniture items”[^102], which should not count as direct financial contributions but I will consider these under her indirect contributions. Adopting a broad-brush approach, I accorded $30,000.00 as the Plaintiff’s financial contribution for the renovation of 1st Matrimonial Flat, even though there were no receipts adduced for such contributions as the 1st Matrimonial Flat was purchased some time ago and as the Defendant had accepted that the renovation expenses which the Plaintiff paid would not exceed $30,000[^103].

#### Renovations to the 2nd Matrimonial Flat

45     The Plaintiff had initially claimed that his contributions to the “renovation cost, furniture, fittings and labour" for the 2nd Matrimonial Flat (which was purchased sometime in late 2017) to be $42,982.00[^104] . However the Plaintiff had subsequently made a significant revision on his contributions as he said that he has spent about $90,000.00 for renovations on the 2nd Matrimonial flat[^105] as he had “personally performed” various rectifications such as patching and plastering, installation of the toilet bowl, plumbing and extension of the toilet bowl and water pipe, etc. sometime in April 2020 to June 2020 during the nation-wide circuit breaker[^106]. The Defendant had objected to any recognition accorded to such works as these home improvement works were done without her consent[^107] and she averred that only $34,480.96 worth of alleged expenses were incurred before the grant of the Interim Judgment. The Defendant also submitted that the Plaintiff’s labour costs is grossly inflated.

46     There is a lack of evidence as to whether these amounts expended on renovation works enhanced the value of the matrimonial flat or the extent of the enhancement of value. The Defendant had accepted that the receipts adduced by the Plaintiff had added up to about $33,000[^108]. Some of the receipts for such last-minute works in the Plaintiff’s 1st Affidavit[^109] were in Mandarin and not translated[^110]. I have disregarded them accordingly.

47     The Defendant had highlighted the case of _Ng So Hang v Wong Sang Woo_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 162</span> to contend that the Court should disregard the works that the Plaintiff said he had done during the Circuit Breaker period. The Defendant argued that payments made towards renovation of the property could be considered as contributions towards the purchase price only if such renovations were carried out closely after the purchase of the property and increased the value of property.

48     In the case of _Tan Chui Lian v Neo Liew Eng_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] SGHC 203</span> (_“Tan Chui Lian”)_, Judicial Commissioner Sundaresh Menon (as he then was) agreed with the approach taken by Justice Tan Lee Meng in _Gurnam Kaur d/o Sardara Singh v Harbhajan Singh s/o Jagraj Singh_ \[2004\] SLR 420 where the Court held that the contributions claimed to have been made by one party years after the purchase, by way of renovation costs, could not be regarded as contributions towards the acquisition of the property. Costs expended much later and are not referable to the initial acquisition should not be taken into account in assessing the property interest of the parties (in a case of dividing property interest between mother and son). In the case of _Tan Chui Lian_, the Court found that the contributions made by the defendant towards the HDB upgrading program should be compensated because these went towards enhancing the value of the flat and the enhancement accrued to the benefit of the plaintiff. The other amounts expended on renovations works did not enhance the value of the flat or were deserving of compensation in any way as there was no material before the Court to form a view on the extent of the enhancement in value.

49     The case of _Tan Chui Lian_ was applied by District Judge Jinny Tan relatively recently in _ULZ v UMA_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGFC 50</span>[^111] when she was a dividing matrimonial property. Considering all the authorities, I have decided not to attribute the Plaintiff with his entire claim of $90,000.00 as his contributions as there was no evidence that the works enhanced the value of the flat and there was no material before the Court to form a view on the extent of the enhancement in value. I was not convinced on a balance of probabilities that the Plaintiff should receive full credit on the $90,000 that he is claiming as his expenses. These additional expenses were incurred way beyond the date when the 2nd Matrimonial Flat was first purchased in 2017[^112]. I was perturbed by the Plaintiff’s use of such a questionable method to increase his financial contributions, including his endeavour to deny the Defendant access[^113] to the unit while he carried out such ‘improvements’ to the 2nd Matrimonial Flat. Marriage is an equal partnership and I agree with the Defendant’s submissions that if we allow the Plaintiff’s last-minute improvement claims, it will encourage divorcing couples to take drastic measures to make last minute home improvements to their matrimonial assets while excluding the other spouse in a desperate attempt to gain an upper hand before an ancillary hearing. Allowing parties to be calculative and competitive does not sit well with the philosophy of marriage or encouraging parties to end their marriage amicably.

50     I have therefore taken a broad-brush approach and attributed a sum of $42,000 as the Plaintiff’s direct contributions for renovations for the 2nd Matrimonial Flat. For the Defendant’s contributions to renovations, the Defendant asserts that she did the electrical installations, furniture from Taobao and Ikea, bedding, kitchen, pots and pans, curtains and cushions[^114]. Adopting a broad-brush approach, I have disregarded such expenses which have no bearing on the value of the 2nd Matrimonial flat, but I will take these into consideration as the Defendant’s indirect contributions.

#### Contributions to Hai Shang Jun

51     The Plaintiff submitted that the Defendant did not contribute to the acquisition of Hai Shang Jun and neither did she contribute towards the renovations of this property.[^115] The Plaintiff has produced documentary evidence[^116] to show that he had transferred $150,000.00 to the Defendant from 27 March to 1 April 2015 of which the Plaintiff soon requested the Defendant to return him the $150,000.00 for the Certificate of Entitlement of his car was going to expire and he wanted the money to purchase another car. However, when he chanced upon Hai Shang Jun, he used the $150,000.00 to purchase Hai Shang Jun[^117].

52     The Defendant on the other hand argued that the Plaintiff had only paid $300,000.00 and that she had paid the remaining $150,000.00[^118]. The Defendant claimed that she had transferred $150,000.00 to the Defendant’s bank account during 2015 - 2016 for purpose of her contribution towards another investment property in China. The Defendant conceded that this $150,000.00 came from the Plaintiff but argued that the Plaintiff had transferred her this sum of money in March 2015 to compensate her[^119] and to appreciate her after he was moved by the love that the late Mr Lee Kwan Yew had for his wife. This sum of money, according to the Defendant, was eventually used for the property at Hai Shang Jun[^120].

53     I had accepted that the Plaintiff had contributed the entire sum of $460,000.00 (part of which were loans from his father and his siblings) and there was no evidence that the sum of $150,000.00 was a gift to the Defendant by the Plaintiff, and neither did the Defendant provide any evidence that the $150,000.00 was transferred back to Plaintiff specifically as her contribution of Hai Shang Jun.

54     For the Defendant’s own contributions for Hai Shang Jun, the Defendant has asserted[^121] that she also paid RMB 80,000 (approximately $16,429.00) and RMB 30,000 (approximately $6,160.00) for purchase price to developer and RMB 5,804 (approximately $1,191.00) for necessary notarial certification costs as the Plaintiff is a foreigner. Some of these documents[^122] were not translated at all and were in Mandarin. The Plaintiff has denied that the Defendant had provided monies for these miscellaneous expenses[^123]. Using a broad-brush approach, I had accorded the Defendant $10,000.00 as her contributions for the miscellaneous expenses incurred for the acquisition of Hai Shang Jun.

#### Contributions for Milano Property

55     The Plaintiff had submitted that he had paid cash of $220,000.00 for the acquisition of the Milano Property while the Defendant contributed the rest[^124], which he has stated to be $62,885.00[^125]. The Plaintiff has produced some remittance receipts to show that he had contributed to the payment of the Milano Property. The Plaintiff accepted[^126] that he is unable to retrieve the documents for the purchase of the Milano Property.

56     The Defendant contended that she had contributed $290,000.00 to the Milano Property and that she contributed $40,000.00 for renovations, furniture etc[^127] but there has not been substantial evidence of her payment of $290,000.00 for the Milano Property save for her assertion that she had used the refunded monies from the Kunshan property as well as her savings from e-commerce to pay for Milano Property[^128]. The Defendant had exhibited the pre-sale contract[^129] which showed that the purchase price of the Milano Property to be about RMB 1,414,277 (about $290,000.00), excluding the renovation fees. The Defendant averred that she had transferred $108,000.00 to the Plaintiff as her share of the Kunshan property but the monies were refunded to her when the purchase of the Kunshan property was not proceeded with. The Defendant did not produce any evidence to show that she had in fact made the bank transfer of $108,000.00 to the Plaintiff’s bank account, save for bare evidence[^130] that there was a consolidated deposit of $327,986.98 and $320,725.87 in her POSB Bank account for the period of September 2010 to October 2013. I agree with Plaintiff’s submissions that there is a lack of conclusive evidence in this regard. It is not clear to me how the monies for Kunshan property could be traceable to the acquisition of the Milano Property.

57     The Defendant had also provided a summary of her renovation expenses for the Milano Property amounting to RMB 217,035.00 (approximately $44,000.00), although there were only two receipts produced - one stating that renovation works of RMB 103,800.00 (approximately $21,254.00) undertaken in 2016 and another “payment for decoration cost” dated 12 September 2016 for RMB 43,800.00 (about $8,990.00). Taking a broad-brush approach, I accorded the Defendant $31,000.00 for the renovation expenses and $63,000.00 for the purchase of the Milano property.

58     On a balance of probabilities, I accepted the Plaintiff’s case theory that he contributed $220,000.00 to the acquisition of the Milano Property.

59     Taking into account the above, as well as the evidence of both parties on their respective contributions, I have apportioned the direct financial contributions as 71.2% to the Plaintiff and 28.8% to the Defendant.

### Application of the ANJ approach: Step 2: Indirect contributions

60     It is trite law that indirect contributions to the well-being of the family comprise of both non-financial and indirect financial contributions, with the determination of the parties’ indirect contribution being an exercise in “broad strokes”, as expressed by the Court of Appeal in _ARY v ARX_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGCA 13</span> at \[55\]. I adopted a broad-brush approach as decided and observed by the Court of Appeal in _USB v USA and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 57</span> at \[43\]-\[46\] for the assessment of the Parties’ indirect contributions.

61     The Plaintiff had submitted that the Court should accord the percentage of 50:50[^131] for both parties’ indirect contributions, taking into account that both parties were working and that there was assistance rendered by domestic helpers and maternal grandparents. The Defendant had submitted that it should be 80:20 in favour of the Defendant, as she was the primary caregiver of the child[^132] and was also bearing the burden of the daily expenses of the child and her own expenses.

62     I considered both parties’ submissions carefully and was mindful that this was a marriage that lasted almost 16 years. I accepted the Defendant’s submissions that she has been the primary caregiver of \[Child 1\] and that she bore the majority of the burden of caring for \[Child 1\]. I acknowledge that the Plaintiff was an involved father, based on the evidence, but also took into account the fact that the Defendant was primarily responsible for the care of \[Child 1\]. While I note that the Plaintiff had provided much of the finances in the purchase of the Chinese properties, I accepted the Defendant’s submissions[^133] that the Court should take into consideration the indirect contributions the Defendant made in the acquisition of the Chinese properties through her efforts, resources and connections. Further, the Plaintiff was able to focus on his career due in no small part to the fact that the Defendant was the primary caregiver of \[Child 1\]. On the Plaintiff’s indirect contributions, I took into consideration his coaching of \[Child 1\] in her studies and his effort in improving the 2nd Matrimonial Flat[^134] besides the examples of indirect contributions that were stated in his affidavits. Accordingly, I found it fair and equitable to attribute a ratio of 60:40 in favour of the Defendant to reflect the indirect contributions she had made towards the family.

### Application of the ANJ approach: Step 3: Average ratio

63     Based on the approach in _ANJ_, I then considered the average of the two ratios to derive each party’s overall contributions to the family. This led to the following ratios:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr"><colgroup><col width="47.8295659131826%"> <col width="25.3450690138028%"> <col width="26.8253650730146%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Plaintiff</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Defendant</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1.

64     In examining past precedents and trends, JC Debbie Ong (as she then was) had, in the case of _UBM v UBN_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 921</span> at \[41\] – \[44\], underscored the relevance of using trends in past cases to guide the Court’s division of assets. JC Ong (as she then was) had highlighted at \[43\] the case of _BCB v BCC_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 2 SLR 324</span> , where the Court of Appeal cited Lim Hui Min, “Matrimonial Asset Division: The Art of Achieving a Just and Equitable Result” in SAL Conference 2011: Developments in Singapore Law Between 2006 and 2010[^135] for the trends in division orders and noted a trend, in marriages more than ten years long, for working mothers with substantially less financial contributions to receive about 40% of the assets, which would be more than her direct financial contributions.

65     The Defendant is a working mother with substantially less financial contributions and looking at past trends, it would be just and equitable for her to receive 44.4% of the assets, which would be more than her direct financial contributions. As a practical consideration I am also mindful that the final ratio in favour of the Defendant would also provide her with sufficient value in the division to take over the Plaintiff’s share in the 2nd Matrimonial Flat, which would be of benefit to the child by providing a roof over her head.

66     The Defendant’s entitlement is therefore 44.4% of the pool of $3,288,599.47 and so she is entitled to $1,460,120.40 from the pool of MA while the Plaintiff is entitled to $1,828,439.065 from the pool. Deducting the Defendant’s sole assets, and taking into consideration the sum of $35,000.00, the Defendant is entitled to $679,120.46 of the assets, while the Plaintiff is entitled to $591,963.73 (after keeping his sole assets of $1,236,475.34). Since the 2nd Matrimonial Flat is valued at $1,080,000.00 with an outstanding mortgage of $686,631.76, the net value of the 2nd Matrimonial Flat is $392,368.24. Deducting $392,368.24 from $676,120.46, the Defendant is entitled to $286,752.22 from the net sale proceeds of the 1st Matrimonial Flat, while the Plaintiff is entitled to the rest of the net sale proceeds of the 1st Matrimonial Flat.

67     Both parties have expressed their intention to retain the 2nd Matrimonial Flat which has Minimum Occupation Period until 10 October 2022. In recognition of the child’s housing needs, I made an order for the Defendant to retain the 2nd Matrimonial Flat so that the Defendant and the child may remain in the 2nd Matrimonial Flat especially when \[Child 1\] is taking her PSLE this year and her school is nearby, but the Defendant shall be responsible for all future mortgage payments for the 2nd Matrimonial Flat.

## Issue (d) - Costs of the proceedings

68     The divorce was granted on a non-contentious basis. Neither could have been said to have acted unreasonably in the conduct of the ancillary matters hearing warranting a costs order and neither party prevailed in the entirety of their arguments before me. I therefore ordered parties to bear their own legal costs.
