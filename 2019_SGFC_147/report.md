Family law – Ancillary Matters

8 January 2020

### District Judge Kathryn Thong:

## Introduction

1       This was an 8½ -year marriage that produced two daughters, Liv and Viv, who were aged 9 and 5 respectively at the time of the hearing. The 37-year-old Plaintiff mother is a property agent and the 40-year-old Defendant father whilst a registered property agent, was jobless since January 2019 when he ceased being a Grab driver.

2       Both parents sought joint custody and sole care and control of their daughters. In particular, the Mother asked that there be no overnight access as the Father had a gaming and smoking lifestyle and had never cared for the children; he also had the habit of surfing pornography. The Father expectedly denied this. He asked for shared care and control if he was not given sole care and control. The Mother contended that this was unworkable given their acrimony.

3       Eventually I ordered care and control of both daughters to the Mother, and in the interim, access by the Father to be supervised at the DSSA. Parties were also to attend counselling to learn how to co-parent.

4       Save for an alleged loan from his parents that the Father asked to be repaid out of the asset pool, the asset pool was ordinary, amounting to some $500,000. I ordered that the Mother’s share stand 54.5%, and the Father’s, 45.5%. The Father was to transfer his share to the Mother by way of sale upon the Mother paying him a sum of $120,055.50. I declined for the alleged loan from the Father’s parents to be “repaid” out of the asset pool. I was not satisfied that it was a loan and even if it was, it was for the Father’s parents to take out the necessary application to determine their share in the flat or to claw back the monies from the parties.

5       At the time of the hearing, there was an interim maintenance order for the Father to pay $500 as maintenance for both daughters. My final orders were for the Father to bear 30% of the children’s expenses for 9 months, after which, this would be increased to 45%. This came up to $356.50 as monthly maintenance for Liv and $311 for Viv. He would also bear 30% of their tuition and enrichment classes. With effect from end June 2020, these sums would increase to $535 and $467 respectively, and he would bear 40% of the tuition and enrichment classes.

6       The Father has appealed against my decision.

## Background

7       Parties were married on 9 August 2009. Interim judgment was granted on 12 March 2018. Upon their marriage, parties stayed with the Father’s parents. Six months later, Liv was born. Parties purchased the matrimonial home in May 2010.

8       Shortly thereafter, the Father’s parents (“the parents”) moved in with the couple. Meanwhile, the parents’ own flat was rented out for $1,800 to $2,000 a month. The tenant would pay the rental into parties’ joint account and from there, the Mother would transfer $1,000 to $1,200 to the Father to transfer to his parents, leaving behind a sum of $800 for parties to pay the cash-portion of their mortgage for their matrimonial home. This is the “loan” the Father claims ought to be repaid to the parents now, which totalled $71,600. The CPF-portion of the mortgage was borne largely by the Father.

9       From 2013, there was some friction between the Mother and the parents; the household groceries were split between the parents and the parties. The Father remarked that he had to decompress by engaging in computer/video gaming because of the stress inflicted upon him by the Mother, which the Mother now asserts is all that he engages in as he refuses to work.

10     Viv was born on Christmas Day 2013. The Mother engaged, and solely paid for a domestic helper as the Father objected to this added expense.

11     Two years later, in October 2015, parties moved to an apartment known as Park Vale and rented out their matrimonial home for a sum of $2,850 per month. These rental monies were paid into parties’ joint account.

12     Things came to a head in September 2017 when the Plaintiff commenced divorce proceedings. In January 2018, the parents ceased crediting the $800 into parties’ joint account, and the said account was closed in July 2018.

13     In February 2018, parties moved back into the matrimonial home. A flurry of PPO applications was launched between parties, and there were eight rounds of mediation. The parents also applied to intervene as third parties but withdrew their application subsequently. A maintenance hearing was also held.

14     Throughout the years, the Father had paid $50 towards the children’s expenses. After mediation, he started paying $300. In May 2019, he was ordered to pay $500 monthly as the children’s maintenance after a contested hearing.

15     Throughout the marriage, the Mother had been working as a property agent and her declared income was $5,000 per month at the time of the hearing. The Father had previously worked as a police officer. In 2012, he left the police force and joined the Mother in the real estate industry. Sometime in 2017, the Father started working part-time as a Grab Driver and/or private car hirer and started a sole proprietorship under his name for this purpose on 10 February 2017. On 16 February 2017, he transferred ownership of his car to the said business.

16     As of December 2017, he was still listed as an Associate Director of his property agency, and as at the date of filing of affidavits, he remained registered though he had no listings. In January 2019, he sold his car and failed to account satisfactorily for these proceeds.

17     In the meantime, Liv was attending primary school and Viv was attending a Montessori preschool. Both were attending tuition and enrichment classes, and all these expenses were wholly paid for by the Mother as the Father did not believe that the children required such extra-curricular activities.

18     Parties were still residing together at the time of the hearing. The Mother would leave the matrimonial home so that the Father and the paternal grandmother could spend time with the children. However, she alleged that the Father did not actually spend meaningful time with them as the children told her the Father would either be gaming in his room or sleeping.

## Custody, care and control of the children

19     Both parties sought joint custody. As has been clearly established in _CX v CY (minor: custody and access)_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 3 SLR(R) 690</span>, generally, joint or no custody orders should be made as that expressly endorses the concept of joint parenting and exhorts parties to co-parent. Sole custody orders would be an exception, and I saw no reason for an exception to be made here.

20     As for care and control, it was clear that the daughters’ interests would be best served by awarding the Mother sole care and control instead of the Father. While the Father claimed to be actively caring for the children, these were bare assertions. In contrast, the Mother communicated with the children’s teachers; produced progress reports from their schools, arranged their extra curricular activities, and it was readily apparent that she took an active interest in their educational well-being.

21     Given that the Father was not working and could be expected to be in the matrimonial home most of the time, there would have been opportunities for him to engage more with the children. Yet, there was no evidence of this. While he claimed that the children were more interested in creative classes such as dance, and that he would rather send them for such classes as opposed to Math or Chinese tuition, there did not appear to be any attempt to send the children for such classes on his own dime.

22     I found that even with the Mother’s busy schedule as a property agent, between her and the Father, it was she who was the primary caregiver of Liv and Viv. Naturally, she had to be assisted by the domestic helper since the Father, despite living in the family home and being without a job, did not step up by doing housework and other chores, such that the family could save money on hiring a helper. Given his objection to having hired help, he could have perform the role of the helper instead. This he did not do.

23     Crucially, underscoring the fact that the Father was unlikely to be the primary caregiver, was the fact that he had no clear care plans outlined for the children, who are both young girls, and especially for Liv, who will be approaching puberty soon. Nothing that the Father stated on evidence suggested that he had applied his mind to the development of the children which was glaring, particularly when he was seeking sole care and control.

24     He expressed that he intended to rely on his parents as his support network to help care for the children. Yet, by his own admission, his parents had health issues and at 77 years and 79 years old, they themselves required the Father’s care. I thus could not accept his argument that it would be better for his parents to care for the children than for the domestic helper to do so (which he claimed would be so if the Mother had care and control).

25     What was also noteworthy was the Father’s resistance towards having any orders (as sought by the Mother) regulating him smoking or drinking around the children. The Father did not appear to be a mere casual smoker or drinker. Photographs exhibited by the Mother revealed cans and bottles of beer/alcohol clustered on his study table, and at least 20 packs of cigarettes purchased for a month’s consumption. Even his own mother smoked, and a photograph revealed her smoking in the kitchen. The Mother cited concerns as to Viv’s sensitivity towards smoke, which the Father dismissed.

26     The Father insisted that he was not a heavy drinker and had been trying to quit smoking. The photograph of the beer bottles and cans was when he was stressed out by the divorce. Regardless, my view was that the Father’s unwillingness to subordinate his own interests to that of the children meant that sole care and control was out of the question.

27     Counsel for the Father, Ms Amelia Ang, submitted that if sole care and control could not be awarded, then an order for shared care and control be made, to which, Ms Thian, counsel for the Mother rightly responded that there is no right to shared care and control. Indeed, one should not view shared care and control as the “next best case” if sole care and control is not granted. There is no presumption of shared care and control. The inquiry must always be what is in the child’s best interests. As Ms Thian pointed out, even though parties remained living together in the matrimonial home, the Father still had to trouble the Mother to get the children ready for his access with them as seen in emails.

28     Even if I were to address my mind to whether shared care and control was workable, Liv is already in primary school. In _TAU v TAT_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHCF 11</span>, the High Court highlighted the importance of considering the impact on a child who will be shuttling between two households, especially where the child has already commenced formal schooling. Further, given the Father’s tendency to smoke and drink and his lackadaisical attitude towards finding a job, I did not think he would provide a supportive environment for the children’s well-being.

29     As for access, I ordered supervised visitation in the interim, as I had concerns over the Father’s smoking and drinking tendencies. It appeared that there could be basis for the Mother’s allegations that the Father was not spending his access meaningfully with the children, given the paucity of objective evidence on his end as to how he cared for the children. In my view, such passive or indifference towards the children in their physical presence, may be just as detrimental to the children, if not more so, than having no access at all. It was thus useful for the Court to glean some insight into his interaction and communication with the children.

## Matrimonial pool and division thereof

30     Ms Ang did not object to the figures or proportions stated in Annex A of Ms Thian’s submissions and I have relied on those figures.

31     Particularly in relation to the matrimonial home, having tabulated the amounts paid by the parties, in the round, I found that 31.2% to the Mother and 68.8% to the Father was fair and reasonable. The reason for the Father’s direct contributions towards the matrimonial home being higher was because from the time of purchase up till November 2016, he had been paying $680 from his CPF account towards the mortgage, with the remaining $584 paid from parties’ joint account.

32     Overall, the asset pool was as follows:

33     In relation to the Mother’s liabilities, I disallowed the alleged loan from her father and the commission allegedly owed to her manager as these were liabilities that emerged late in the proceedings and the documents produced to evince such loans were undated. On the whole, I found these allegations self-serving and unsupported by objective evidence.

34     As for the UOB credit card balance transfer and DBS card instalment plans, these were liabilities incurred after interim judgment was granted. However, I partially allowed the sum of $441.75 as this payment was for an instalment plan for the Mother’s property advertisements. This was a liability incurred before the grant of the interim judgment.

35     As for the sales proceeds of the Father’s car, I added this back into the pool on the authority of _TNK v TNL_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 15</span>. While Ms Ang submitted that the proceeds were used to maintain the family, there was no evidence of this. Ms Ang suggested that the figures would match the Father’s outgoings. Having done the matching herself, she thought the figures reconciled themselves. But no such summation was actually produced, and when queried where the sales proceeds were first deposited into, (which Ms Ang stated, was received in cash) Ms Ang could not even confirm if the monies were deposited into a bank account which would have enabled the Court to ascertain outflows. There was simply no trail of how the monies were received or used.

36     In any event, _TNK v TNL_ is clear on the principle that if there is no implied or express consent from the other spouse as to how the monies were expended, and the spouse may be said to have a putative interest in such monies, then it is immaterial that the monies were indeed used on the family. Given the separate lives parties were living by that time, it was of no assistance to the Father to claim that the Mother must have known that the proceeds were used on the family.

37     Parties’ direct financial contributions were thus as follows:

38     As for parties’ indirect contributions, Ms Thian submitted that 95% should be attributed to the Mother. Ms Ang countered that this was too high and that direct financial contributions should be given more weight in shorter marriages. She submitted that 55% to the Father and 45% would be more appropriate.

39     Ms Ang listed the Father’s contributions when parties first married to be installing air conditioners, purchasing a queen size bed and furniture for the bedroom in his parents’ flat. Reference was also made to the Father’s mother assistance in cooking and washing before the Mother engaged a helper in 2013. These minor improvements to the parents’ flat were minimal and as pointed out by Ms Thian, the true beneficiaries were the parents who subsequently rented out the flat; the Mother only benefited for a brief period before she moved out.

40     In addition, the Father claimed to pay for the broadband subscription and telephone line for the household which came up to at least $1,000 per month. Apart from the $50 contribution towards the children’s maintenance, Ms Ang pointed out that the Father would also pay the property tax and conservancy charges, as well as the groceries and sundries of the household. He also claimed to have paid for the children’s visits to the doctor and meals outside, just that no receipts were available.

41     All these claims of contributions were bare assertions, unsupported by documentary evidence. As Ms Thian pointed out, credit card statements could have been obtained as proof of such payments. In fact, the Court had ordered for such at the discovery hearing. The Father failed to produce such documents.

42     There were also claims by the Father of instances when the Mother did not transfer the full sum of $1,200 to him to transfer onward to his parents, such that he had to top up the shortfall by another $100 or so. This was his indirect contribution as well. The Mother denied this. In any event, she stated that the Husband would often ask her to help him pay for certain personal expenses which she would deduct from the $1,200 to be transferred. Hence, even if the Father had to “top up” the $1,200, this was his responsibility since the shortfall arose from his personal expenses.

43     The only indirect contribution that was supported by some evidence was the renovation undertaken for the matrimonial home. The Mother acknowledged that the Father had paid for some of these and was of the view that the expenses had been borne equally by the parties. Her evidence was that she would issue the cheques and the Father would reimburse her accordingly. Some of these expenses were also paid through parties’ joint account. Given that this was in the early days of the marriage, and relations were still good, I find that such expenses can be attributed equally between parties.

44     As for the Mother’s indirect contributions, over the years, the Mother had spent more than $80,000 on the children’s enrichment and school fees, with the Father contributing nothing as he did not believe the children should be attending such expensive classes. Notably, this figure of $80,000 did not include the share of the children’s household expenses and other expenses such as the insurance premiums for their policies. The Mother had also solely paid the family’s utilities bill from June 2010 to October 2014. These bills were subsequently deducted from the joint account and from January 2018 onwards, the Wife bore these expenses solely as the Husband refused to pay his share. This was not rebutted by the Father.

45     The Mother clearly was the one monitoring the children’s educational development, signing off on Liv’s Chinese spelling exercises; school assessment papers and communicating with the children’s teachers. There was nothing produced by the Father to suggest his involvement in the children’s education. Rather, he made sweeping statements of changing the children’s diapers, teaching them the alphabet, reading to them, disciplining them, feeding them, sending them to school and enrichment classes, and guiding them in their schoolwork, bringing them out to places of interest. This was broadly, the sum total of his indirect non-financial contributions. There was no specificity or particularity as to these contributions, such as a routine he adopted in guiding them in their homework. Particularly when he was a police officer and did shift work from 7am to 7pm and 7pm to 7am, the nature of his job would have made it difficult to care for the children and the Father’s account was somewhat incredible.

46     In addition, the Mother assisted the Father in the initial years of his real estate business as well (see \[65\]-\[66\] below) which he benefited from. This was admitted by the Father, who even credited the Mother for his higher earnings in when he first embarked on his new career.

47     While the Father attempted to minimise the Mother’s contributions, it is noteworthy that the domestic help is paid for entirely by the Mother. Given that she is a working mother and the lack of help she gets from the Father, she should not be begrudged for having a helper. As observed in _Pang Rosaline v Chan Kong Chin_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 4 SLR(R) 935</span> at \[20\], the managerial role that is performed in managing the helper, is as essential and important as the direct performance of the chores itself, and does not diminish her contributions.

48     It was evident that the Mother had taken on the burden of being both primary caregiver and the breadwinner. While I agree that direct financial contributions tend to feature more prominently in shorter marriages, this is not to say that by default, indirect contributions would be given less weight. In the final analysis, a broad brush approach is to be taken as the Court of Appeal observed in _ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span> (“_ANJ v ANK_”). In that case, the Court had also highlighted that where parties are both working, the Mother can be expected to be the one who contributes more in terms of the non-financial contributions.

49     I was of the view that in the present case, 75% to the Mother and 25% to the Father was a fair apportionment of their indirect contributions.

50     Applying _ANJ v ANK_, the average of parties’ direct financial contributions and indirect contributions was 54.5% to the Mother and 45.5% to the Father. I see no reason to adjust this ratio.

51     The Mother’s share of the pool came up to $289,787.7 and the Father’s share came up to $241,932.86. After retaining assets in his name, he was owed $120,055.5. I ordered the Father was to transfer his share in the matrimonial flat (by way of sale) upon the Mother paying to him the sum of $120,055.50 within 3 months from the date of this Order, and the Father would be responsible for making the requisite CPF refunds into his own account.

## Spousal maintenance

52     The Mother did not seek spousal maintenance in view of her proposal for the flat to be transferred to her without consideration and no CPF refunds to the Father. Though I eventually ordered otherwise, I saw no reason to award the Mother maintenance given that she was young, healthy, capable and clearly the higher income earner than the Father (see _ATE v ATD_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGCA 2</span>).

## Children’s maintenance

53     The Father’s position was that he would pay $300 for the children’s maintenance if he was not awarded care and control. He portrayed himself as being impecunious and striving for the family. He thought the Mother was spending beyond their means and stated that he would only pay whatever the family could afford.

54     My view was that the Mother had indeed overstretched herself financially and this was evident in her reliance on living off credit. Many of the expenses incurred (see below) were undertaken even after divorce proceedings were commenced, when one would be expected to tighten their belt due to legal expenses. While she may have the children’s best interests at heart, the quantum had to be reasonable taking reference from parties’ income and earning capacity. In the premises, I adjusted some figures for the children’s expenses:

55     I explain my findings apart from whatever has been stated in the ‘remarks’ columns. For Viv, I disallowed a component for transport as this should be subsumed under the Mother’s own use of the car. Further, it is somewhat artificial to apportion the petrol expenses to Viv unless it could be demonstrated clearly, that the ferrying and its frequency meant that Viv significantly adds to the petrol costs. Given the nature of the Mother’s work as a property agent, I would reckon that the petrol costs were mostly due to work.

56     As for the over the counter medications etc. I reduced these to $30 as such vitamins etcetera would be bought every few months only and could also be shared with Liv.

57     The Father would pay for his share of the pre-school and enrichment classes separately (as opposed to being a component of the maintenance) as such classes are not necessarily always ongoing and are in that sense, dynamic.

58     To these figures, I added another $143 to the children’s maintenance as their share of the household expenses for (a) utilities; (b) internet and (c) home needs. I excluded the mortgage instalments, property tax and service and conservancy charges as these are matters that are tied to the property itself and not dependent on the number or identity of occupiers. Simply put, whether the children live with the Mother or not, the same amount is payable and cannot be varied. I also excluded furniture and appliances as these are one-off expenses and I doubt they can be considered maintenance**. (see Annex A)**

59     As for the domestic helper’s expenses, I added another $250 to each child for their share. The Mother had stated that the domestic helper was hired to look after the children. However, I found that only the helper’s monthly salary of $750 was to be split 3 –ways; all other expenses claimed by the Mother were either one-off, ought to be solely borne by the mother (eg. levy); and there are economies of scale for the groceries, such that it is was artificial to apportion $400 for the helper’s share. **(see Annex A).**

60     The Mother had also listed car related expenses to be attributed to the children. I did not include such expenses, as there was no evidence that the car was purchased for the children; it was in all likelihood purchased for the Mother’s job, which is why she chose a 2nd hand Mercedes Benz. The children merely benefit incidentally from the car. **(see Annex A).**

61     The children’s total expenses (excluding enrichment) came up to $1,188.83 for Liv and $1,037.77 for Viv.

62     As for the proportion that parties ought to bear in respect of the children’s expenses, the Mother submitted that the Father could earn a good income and had in fact done so previously. She believed that the Father had deliberately scaled down his work for the real estate and private hiring/driving businesses when she filed for divorce, in order to reduce his maintenance obligations, and exhibited a text message that he intended to quit his jobs.

63     While the Father claimed he could not find a job due to the stress of the divorce proceedings and potential employers eschewing him, there was no objective evidence of this, or that the pressure and distress had so incapacitated him, he was unable to work. The Father had gone through several sets of solicitors from various law firms in these proceedings. This was not someone who appeared to be paralysed by stress or depression.

64     The Father’s IRAS statements revealed a downward trend in his annual income particularly for YA 2018:

65     According to the Father, he could earn such high income in the earlier years only because of the Mother’s introduction of her clients to him, coupled with her use of underhanded methods to bring in clients. He remarked that he could not bring himself to engage in such unethical behaviour. Further, when she filed for divorce in 2017, she took back all her clients from him.

66     The above allegations were unsubstantiated. The Mother’s account – which was not rebutted – was that she stopped helping the Father in his real estate business by end 2013 when Viv was born, as she could no longer bear the additional burden of helping him and wanted him to be independent.

67     Despite withdrawing her assistance in end 2013, in the immediate year after, _i.e._ 2014 (YA 2015), the Father managed an average income of $3,274 without the Mother’s assistance. And in 2015, the Father’s average income was $2,334. By this time, he was already without the Mother’s assistance for two years. The only plausible explanation for the drop in income would be the Father’s lack of industry.

68     Even if it were true that the Mother had taken back her clients after proceedings commenced, I did not see how this would have impacted the Father. Any diversion of potential business away from him would have been after September 2017. The drastic drop in income for the whole of 2017 can only be attributed to the Father’s failure to exert himself enough.

69     In this vein, it was telling that as a registered property agent, he did not have any current listings at the time of the hearing, which only underscored his lack of industry. And in January 2019, he sold off his vehicle which provided a source of income. While he claimed to have used these monies on the family, as adverted earlier, there was no evidence of this. Besides, why would he slaughter the proverbial golden goose?

70     Indeed, the Mother pointed out that he was earning a respectable income whilst driving GRAB. After deduction for commission, his income was as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="50.02%"> <col width="49.98%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Month in 2017</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Income post deduction</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">June</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4,084.59</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">July</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">6,159.54</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">September</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4,179.15</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">October</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2,581.80 in a single week</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

71     The Mother was of the view that the Father could earn a net income of some $4,000 - $5,000 if he wanted to, be it as a property agent or GRAB driver. Even without a car, he could rent one and drive for GRAB.

72     Ms Ang explained that the benefits at GRAB were good which he why he managed to earn such an income. This appeared to be evidence from the bar and Ms Ang did not write in to clarify where the reference was on affidavit, though invited to do so.

73     The Father’s capacity to earn a good income as a self-employed person was evident. He could also return to the police force. Based on his CPF contributions for when he was in the police force, he would have been drawing at least $3,000 based on the monthly CPF contribution of $768.

74     To determine the proportion of expenses to be borne by parties, I found that a reasonable piece of evidence to rely on would be a Hamptons school waitlist form of 10 July 2017, where the declared gross income on the school enrolment form was $6,275 and $2,659 to the Mother and the Father respectively. Both parties had signed on the form. In the premises, I found that the proportion of expenses (including enrichment) to be borne presently to be 70% to the Mother and 30% to Father, for a period of 9 months. This took into account his current jobless situation – which is unacceptable – and recognises that he has an earning capacity to pay more than 30% of the children’s expenses, if he simply exerts himself. 9 months should give him enough time to secure a proper job.

75     After the 9 months had passed, his share of the children’s general expenses would increase to 45% but that for enrichment would increase to 40%, instead of 45%. The reason for no corresponding increase for the enrichment proportion was to factor in the Mother’s predilection for high-end enrichment classes. As such, it seemed just that the Father would bear a lower proportion of these enrichment expenses as compared to the general expenses.

76     The final figures stood as follows: with effect from 30 September 2019 and until 31 May 2020, the Father was to pay $356.50 as monthly maintenance for Liv, and $311 for Viv. He was to also pay 30% of all tuition and enrichment expenses. With effect from June 2020, the monthly maintenance would increase to $535 and $467, and the Father would also bear 40% of their enrichment classes.

77     Given the Father’s earning capacity, and the fact that he had claimed on affidavit to be able to bear the children’s expenses solely at $1,393, I was of the view that the Father should be able to afford the maintenance. After all, he currently spends $500 a month on food and $300 on entertainment.

## Conclusion

78     Parties have divergent personalities. The Mother was industrious and driven, whilst the Father appeared lackadaisical in most aspects of his life, and it was troubling that he did not seem interested in securing a job. He should not be mistaken that joblessness _per se_ is reason enough not to pay maintenance. The law requires parents to maintain their children, and as a corollary, it behoves any parent to exert reasonable efforts to secure a job to provide income. Less able-bodied parents have gone to extraordinary lengths to do so. It also came to my attention that the Father has refused to attend the supervised visitation at the DSSA. As he is without a job and has time on his hands, I do not see the basis for his resistance, particularly if he has a warm relationship with the children.
