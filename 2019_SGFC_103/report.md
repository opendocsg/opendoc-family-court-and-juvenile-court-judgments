Breach of Committal Orders

17 September 2019

### District Judge Toh Wee San:

### Introduction

1       This is an appeal by the Defendant Husband (“H”) in respect of my committal orders against him. I explain my decision below.

### Background

2       The Plaintiff Wife (“W”) applied for leave to commence committal proceeding against H, with a statement and supporting affidavit. Leave was granted to her and she filed a summons and second affidavit for an order of committal against H for breaching three court orders – access orders dated 9 May 2018 by consent (“AO1”), access order concerning travel to Bangkok dated 22 November 2018 (“AO2”) and access order dated 10 December 2018 (“AO3”). A copy of AO1, AO2 and AO3 are attached.

3       Parties have a child, a boy aged 9 years old (“the child”). Parties had been fighting in court over the child’s issues since 2014. Under AO1 and AO3, parties have joint custody, shared care and control (“CC”) over the child. In short, H was ordered to be the care parent from Thursday afternoon to Sunday afternoon while W was the care parent from Sunday afternoon to Thursday morning every week. Under AO2, W was ordered to be the care parent for the child when they go to Bangkok for a 3-day trip and H may accompany them.

4       The first issue was whether W had complied with the committal procedures followed by whether H had breached the three court orders by dis-allowing W access to the child on her care days and the Bangkok trip.

### Parties’ cases in brief

#### Issue 1: Committal procedure

5       H’s case was W’s application should not even be considered as she had not complied with the committal procedure because her statement was too brief. H cited a case to show that such deficiency cannot be cured by the accompanying affidavit[^1]. Instead every essential particular must be in the statement and verified by an affidavit. W disagreed and argued that leave was granted for her to commence her committal application. Moreover, H replied to her committal affidavits and was therefore not prejudiced.

#### Issue 2: Breach of access orders

6       W’s case was H had never once brought the child to handover on time, failed to turn up many times and only gave her Saturday access 2 to 3 times over the past 3 years. For the committal summons in question, H refused to make the child available for her to pick up on her days of access. W first provided details of the failed access sessions between 24 November 2018 to 19 December 2018 in her affidavit[^2]. She also asserted that for AO2, she was entitled to be the care parent when the child travelled to Bangkok with her and H. However, H did not allow her to do so and didn’t pass her the child’s passport though ordered to do so under AO2. These were not disputed by H. In W’s subsequent affidavit, she provided details of more failed access sessions in other time-frames.

7       Next H also argued that he was unable to provide access on W’s care days because the child was unwilling to go to W. To illustrate this, H provided a video recording of the child’s conduct on 4 March 2019 to show the child’s reluctance to cooperate with H. In relation to AO2, H’s case was parties went to Bangkok with the child and W was not prevented from spending time with the child. As for H’s appearances before the child on his non care days, H argued that these were not prohibited by the court order. Instead H opined that he had good reasons to do so. For example, H was providing emotional support to his child due to the pressure faced by the child from W concerning the child’s football practices. In other instances, H was interacting with the child. There were also days in which H did not send the child to school and these were due to the child’s reluctance, ailments or distress. Hence H’s position was these also cannot be said to be breaches of the court order.

8       After parties have completed their submissions and just before the court delivered its decision, H provided an English case[^3] to support their position that H’s obligations under the court order was to allow contact and make child available for contact, rather than ensure contact.

### The Law

9       Section 12 of the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act empowers the court to punish a person who has committed contempt of court of a fine not exceeding S$12000 or/and imprisonment not exceeding 12 months. Rule 763 of the Family Justice Rules (“FJR”) empowers the court to suspend the execution of the committal orders. In addition, there are well established principles that committal proceedings are a last resort for family proceedings, must be proven beyond reasonable doubt and procedural safeguards are important.

### Decision and basis

10     In respect of issue 1, I did not accept H’s argument to reject the entire committal application. Though W’s committal statement was brief, it clearly stated the specific grounds upon which relief was sought and also expressly informed the reader to refer to the accompanying affidavit for more details. The High Court case cited by H’s counsel discussed such instances whereby lengthy details of the statement/notice could be included in a schedule or attachment to the notice[^4]. W’s approach amounted to the same effect in substance. It would not be fair to dismiss W’s application on this technical ground. Moreover, the present facts did not prejudice H. The details of each incident which explained how H had breached the court orders were sufficiently provided in W’s accompanying affidavit during the leave stage. Leave was granted by the court after looking at both documents. H also replied to W’s affidavits (both at and after the leave stage). However, the rules were silent on whether W can provide further evidence after leave has been granted and I declined to consider those evidence.

11     After considering evidence from both sides in totality, I found H to have breached AO1 and AO3 i.e. the court order for failing to provide access to W on:

> a.     24 November 2018 (Saturday)

> b.     25 November 2018 (Sunday)

> c.     28 November 2018 (Wednesday)

> d.     5 December 2018 (Wednesday)

> e.     10 December 2018 (Monday)

> f.     12 December 2018 (Wednesday)

> g.     18 December 2018 (Tuesday)

> h.     19 December 2018 (Wednesday)

> i.     25 December 2018 (Tuesday)

12     My reasons were it was not disputed by H that W failed to access her child on these days. In addition, W had provided full details of her attempts to see the child on these dates and the lack of response, cooperation or facilitation from H. W had attached some screen shots of the messages made to H with no replies. While I noted H’s general explanation that the child was reluctant to attend the access, I was not persuaded that this was a valid reason for every failed access listed above. Moreover, the video evidence adduced by H was around March 2019 while the dates in issue were more than 3 months earlier than March 2019. It was also undisputed that the child was not alienated from W and he was comfortable, had a good relationship with W when H was not around. Considering the background and acrimony behind the matter, W had proven beyond a doubt that H had breached the court order on the dates listed.

13     I also found H to have breached AO2 i.e. the court order for failing to allow W to be the care parent for the Bangkok trip from 7 to 10 December 2018. In particular, excluding travelling days, W would have missed two full days of being the care parent to the child in Bangkok. I accepted H’s explanation that due to the shortage of time, he was unable to make flight arrangement for W and the child to travel together. However, allowing W to be the care parent was a different matter. W also asserted that she had asked to room with the child but H had threatened her not to do so. H made no specific reply to W’s assertion and I accepted W’s version on this point. This was clearly non-compliant with the court order and not acceptable.

14     However, I accepted the following to be valid mitigating factors for H.

> a.     Reluctance of the child to go to W voluntarily on occasions. As admitted by H, he did not wish to “manhandle and forcibly move” his son to avoid conflict with his child. However, there was a need to be less permissive with the child in this regard in future.

> b.     Efforts by H to engage W to overcome the child’s resistance to go to W on occasions but these were rejected by W. Hence there was a need for W to be more cooperative and flexible in this regard in future.

15     In view of the above, I committed H to a fine of $ 3000 for 11 days of breaches. However, before I did so, I invoked rule 763 of the Family Justice Rules to suspend the execution of the committal orders subject to the conditions below. This was because in accordance with the higher court’s guidance, committal was the last resort for family cases. These conditions were imposed with the aim of encouraging and expecting parties to comply with the court orders, co-operate more effectively and providing W with a proportionate amount of make-up access time with the child. Particularly for condition 4, it was clear to me that the child was presently badly conflict between both parents. Parties were also highly acrimonious against each other. It would be in the child’s best interest for only the care parent to be present as an interim measure. As time passes by and the situation improves, parties can lift this restriction by agreement.

> Condition 1: H shall comply with the access orders dated 10 December 2018 with immediate effect.

> Condition 2: W shall have access of up to 70% of the child’s summer holidays in 2019, subject to the parties jointly consulting with the child re his holiday preferences. For illustration, if the child prefers to attend the overseas training with H, they may do so but this will be limited to 30% of the child’s summer holidays. W shall have the remaining 70% of the summer holidays with the child and they may also travel overseas.

> Condition 3: W shall pick the child up from H’s residence if the child refused to go to the guardhouse. H shall also impress upon the child that this is a court ordered access arrangement for W to spend time with him and the child is required to obey and cooperate.

> Condition 4: Parties with no care duties shall not appear in front of the child or his schooling premise on the days or/and durations in question.

> Condition 5: Unless parties agree, parties shall not arrange any new activity for the child on days which are not his or her access days.

16     As W had been successful in her application, I ordered H to pay costs of $1000 for the present summons and related cross summons 706/2019 filed by H which was dismissed by me.
