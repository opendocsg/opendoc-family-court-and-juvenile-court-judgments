Family Law – Ancillary Matters

24 January 2020

### District Judge Kathryn Thong:

## Introduction

1       This was a 10-year marriage. Parties have an 8-year-old daughter, Cate, and a 6-year-old son, Jim, who are in Primary 4 and Primary 2 respectively at the time of hearing.

2       Both parties sought sole care and control of the children. The 42-year-old Plaintiff husband accused his 40-year-old wife of being lax in her parenting, spending large swathes of time in Malaysia with her family, and being poor at managing her life.

3       The Mother portrayed the Father as indifferent towards the children’s needs, being hands off with them, and choosing to spend his spare time sleeping instead of helping them with their homework. She claimed that his work as a casino pit supervisor meant he kept late nights and she alluded to an extra-marital affair and a gambling addiction, though this was unproven.

4       I eventually ordered shared care and control between parties. While I was mindful that parties were quarrelsome and somewhat resentful of each other’s behaviour, I was of the view that their unhappiness stemmed from poor communication, particularly over the children’s affairs. Both cared for their children though it was apparent they needed help structuring a routine for them and understanding their children’s needs. With the appropriate counselling, I was of the view that parties should be able to co-parent with minimal friction and this would be in the best interests of the children.

5       The asset pool was modest and came up to slightly over $500,000 with the main asset being parties’ HDB flat at Bendemeer. I ordered that the Mother’s share of the asset pool was 30% and the Father’s, 70%. She was to buy over his share of the flat as per her request.

6       For the first year (from which my orders were made) the Father would pay a total of $500 towards the children’s maintenance given the Mother’s lower income. Thereafter, parties would maintain the children when they were in their care and control, and the Father was to bear fully their tuition and enrichment classes, given his higher earning capacity, provided he consented to them. Otherwise, he would bear 69% of such expenses.

7       The Mother has appealed against my decision.

## Background

8       The 40-year-old Mother is Malaysian and the 42-year-old Father, Singaporean. They married in September 2006. At the time of the hearing, the Mother was a part-time shop-assistant drawing a salary of $500. The Father was a casino pit supervisor working the night shift, earning a gross income of $5,191.50. His take home income was $4,153.20.

9       In August 2010, parties purchased their matrimonial home. The mortgage instalment of $1,217 was initially paid from parties’ CPF accounts, with $414 being deducted from the Mother’s CPF account and $803 from the Father’s.

10     After Cate’s birth in September 2010, the Mother quit her job against the Father’s wishes to care for Cate. Sometime in 2011, the Father started bearing the full sum of the monthly mortgage instalment. This was because the Mother had insufficient funds in her CPF account. In December 2012, Jim was born.

11     The Father remarked that even after both children were enrolled in childcare, all efforts by the Mother to find any work were half-hearted with her job-hopping and lazing at home. She was unable to stay in long-term employment and her last drawn salary was in May 2016, where she earned a gross income of $2,300.

12     Denying that she was lazy, the Mother explained that she was simply trying to find some work-life balance as her focus was on the children.

13     On 30 March 2017, the Father filed for divorce on the grounds of unreasonable behaviour. Interim judgment was granted on 11 October 2017, which the Mother applied to set aside. Her application was dismissed.

## Mother’s conduct in the proceedings

14     In an earlier stage of the proceedings, the Mother had been represented by Gloria James-Civetta (“GJC”) but the Legal Aid Bureau cancelled its provision of legal aid on 13 September 2017 due to the Mother failing to show up for appointments and GJC being unable to take instructions. From thereon, she was self-represented. At least she was, until the eve of the decision hearing.

15     She was also absent from a case conference shortly before the ancillary matters hearings, claiming that she had to attend to her father who was ill in Malaysia.

16     Prior to the ancillary matters hearing, the Mother was ordered to produce _inter alia_, payslips of her current and previous employment; her Notices of Assessment for the last 3 years and receipts of her father’s medical treatment. She failed to do so.

17     The Mother also failed to produce as ordered, entries in her passport for the years 2016 and 2017, which would reveal the frequency of her trips out of Singapore, presumably to Malaysia.

18     At the hearing for the ancillaries, she appeared with a bundle of documents purporting to be her 2nd affidavit of assets and means (“2nd AOM”). I allowed the affidavit to be admitted save for certain exhibits which I found to be scandalous, vexatious and irrelevant. Despite clear directions given for the 2nd AOM to be filed without the offending exhibits, the Mother did otherwise, and even turned up at the subsequent hearing with a summons for discovery and interrogatories against the Father, filed the day before. I dismissed this summons.

19     At the hearing for the decision to be rendered, Mr Jonathan Wong of Tembusu Law LLC suddenly appeared on behalf of the Mother. The notice of appointment was filed the night before.

20     I invited counsel’s views on the more administrative aspects of the decision, such as the transfer or sale of the flat and the Mother’s ability to pay for the Father’s share. To this end, I asked Mr Wong if the Mother was still working to which his reply was “Very sketchy on the details.” \[_sic_\]

21     There was a sense from reading the Mother’s scant affidavits and her conduct in these proceedings, that she was not very organised in running her life.

## Custody, care and control

22     As mentioned earlier, both parties sought sole care and control. The Father claimed he was the primary caregiver, and the Mother derelict in her duties. He claimed she would laze around the house and failed to do the household chores. As his shift was from 8pm to 4am, he was able to send the children to school and back from day care and when Jim was still in childcare, he would occasionally fetch him home. He would also supervise their homework.

23     The Father also took issue with the Mother unilaterally withdrawing Jim from the childcare in December 2018, and refusing to allow Cate to attend the student care which was also paid for by the Father. He spoke of how he found out about the Mother’s intention to withdraw Jim in September 2018 but managed to stop her from doing so, until her unilateral withdrawal in December 2018. The Mother did not explain her actions and the Father averred that the Mother clearly could not act in the children’s best interests.

24     The Father also complained that the Mother would travel to Malaysia at the last minute and would refuse to tell him how long she would be away. Each time, she would be gone for some 6 to 10 days. On such occasions, he would enlist his parents’ help to care for the children whilst he was at work.

25     His proposal was to sell the matrimonial flat and have his mother, _i.e._ the paternal grandmother, look after the children. However, he revealed also at the hearing that she was looking after other grandchildren but they would probably be moving out soon.

26     The Mother claimed that she was the primary caregiver of both children and how she had sought flexible work arrangements in order to send the children to childcare whilst doing the housework. This was particularly so after a domestic helper was released in 2012. She claimed to check the children’s homework, participate in school activities, see to their everyday needs, as well as doing the household chores. Mention was made of taking turns with the Father to care for the children during a period of hospitalisation, but no further details were given. No evidence was proffered either of the participation in school activities or communications with teachers.

27     She complained that there was little bonding time that the family had over the weekends due to the Father’s irregular work schedule. Tearfully she commented that the Father hardly spent time with the children as they would mostly be dropped off at their paternal grandmother’s place when the Father had to care of them.

28     Allegations were made of the Father having gambling debts and the Mother also alluded to an affair with a Vietnamese lady which the Father vehemently denied.

29     As for her trips to Malaysia, the Mother explained that her father underwent an operation in 2016 and from 2017 onwards, she had to juggle between caring for her father and her children. She clarified during the hearing that her father was losing his eyesight but produced no supporting documents.

30     The Mother wished to retain the flat until the children were 18 years old so that they would enjoy stability, especially since their primary school was near the matrimonial flat. If she could not retain the flat, she said she would purchase her own home.

31     Somewhat startling was the Mother’s revelation at the hearing that the children were unaware of the divorce. The Mother stated she wished to protect them from being upset. It was apparent at the hearing that the Mother was fearful of losing care and control of the children and that she felt attached to them.

32     The Father claimed he had informed Cate that the parents were separating and she had wanted to follow him. As for Jim, the Father shared he was closer to the Mother. Nonetheless, he was determined to have care and control of the children and to sell the matrimonial home.

33     In deciding what would be in the best interests of the children, I was of the view that stability would be a key consideration, given that the children were now attending formal schooling. In particular, they were unaware of the ongoing divorce proceedings, but in due course would have to find out about their parents’ divorce. Naturally, such news would disrupt their lives mentally, emotionally and even psychologically, and maintaining the status quo would be beneficial for the near future.

34     Absent from both parties’ affidavits were details as to the children’s daily routine, in spite of them asking for sole care and control. There was a gap in information as to how parties actually spent their time with the children and in this vein, it appeared that parties’ respective claims of supervision of homework, was likely more _ad hoc_ than systematic.

35     The above was somewhat reinforced by the remarks in the confidential report I called for, where it stated that both children were academically lagging behind their peers. I should point out that parties ought to be well aware of this fact since this feedback came from the children’s teachers. It lent credence to my view that the parties were not giving both children as much attention as they believed, and had likely overstated their contributions in this aspect.

36     In the round, it appeared that the Mother – when she was in Singapore at least –was around the children more often that the Father, who worked from 8pm to 4am. However, it was unclear what exactly she did with the children, given that Jim spent most of his time in childcare (Jim) and Cate, in student care. The Mother also seemed to have difficulty managing her priorities with her disappearance to Malaysia every now and then.

37     I was mindful that the Mother was bereft of family support in Singapore and her conduct as outlined earlier, gave little confidence that she would be able to manage on her own should she have sole care and control of the children. She was clearly very emotional over the divorce and somewhat in denial, prompting this Court if parties wanted to attend reconciliation counselling. Unfortunately, the Father refused it. It was of concern to me how the Mother would handle caring for the children post-divorce, with her fragile emotional state and her seeming inability to organise her life and juggle her priorities.

38     Likewise, with the Father, his suggestion to have his parents care for his children was of concern given that they were already in their mid-sixties and his mother was also caring for other grandchildren. His suggestion to sell the matrimonial flat, ignoring the fact that the children were well settled in and enjoyed proximity to their schools, gave pause as to whether he had applied his mind as to what was in their best interests.

39     The impression from the affidavits was that parents had very little and poor communication, perhaps due to their personalities and lack of face time with each other due to their erratic schedules. This resulted in them engaging in parallel parenting, with each of them doing as they thought appropriate with the children. The Mother seemed more attuned to the children’s emotional needs, though she appeared ill-equipped to help the children with their schoolwork. The Father on the other hand, appeared more methodical, stable, and organised in running his life, but did not appear to be emotionally available for them nor have the time to do so.

40     As much as I found each parent somewhat wanting in terms of their care towards the children, both parents did not present with serious parenting deficits and this was supported by the confidential report. I believed counselling would enable them to effectively parent the children – after all, they both did care for the children.

41     In the premises, I was of the view that it would be in the children’s best interests to have joint custody of the children of the marriage, with shared care and control to the Mother from Monday to Thursday, and to the Father from Friday afternoons to Sunday evenings. The Father would also be at liberty to fetch the children back from school from Monday to Friday. Parties were to attend counselling at the DSSA to learn parenting strategies and the children are to attend the Child in Between programme.

## The Matrimonial Pool and Value thereof

42     Generally, the date of ascertaining the pool is the date of interim judgment and the valuation, the date of the hearing, save for the monies in the bank accounts. I saw no reason to depart from these positions. The Mother did not dispute the figures in the Father’s declaration of value of matrimonial assets, nor did she produce her own declaration. In the premises, I adopted wholly the figures stated in the Father’s declaration, save for certain liabilities which I explain further below.

43     Parties assets were as follows:

44     The staggering credit card and personal loan liabilities of the Father were unexplained. He was the sole breadwinner of the family, and by his estimates, the monthly expenses for the family (including his personal expenses) came up to $1,923 per month. Adding his alleged contribution of $300 towards his mother, his total expenses came up to $2,223 per month. This meant he should have a balance of $1,930.20 each month. Yet, his total liabilities (excluding his mortgage which was paid from his CPF) came up to $39,301.35.

45     There was mention of renovation expenses amounting to $12,000 that was paid by the Father, which the Mother did not dispute. Assuming this formed part of the Father’s liabilities, and allowing a further $8,000 of these liabilities to be attributed as additional borrowing for the family’s expenses, there remained some $19,301.35 unaccounted for. I thus credited the sum of $19,000 (rounded down) to the pool. The total asset pool thus came up to $532,340.99 which I rounded down to $532,341.

## Division of the assets

46     Parties’ direct contributions were as follows:

47     The above figures were produced by the Father and were not disputed by the Mother. At the hearing, she claimed she had contributed a sum of $2,993.85 when the matrimonial home was first purchased, which the Father conceded was paid by her. Her bank passbook also revealed the relevant deduction. As there was no evidence that these monies were refunded to her as alleged by the Father, and I saw no reason why the HDB would refund her such monies, I added a sum of $3,000 as her initial payment towards the flat as seen in the above table.

48     As for parties’ indirect contributions, I was of the view that it was significant that the Father had paid for all household expenses, including the renovations. His bank statements also revealed payments for the household groceries and he had also purchased insurance policies for the children. It must be noted that the Mother herself was working but there was no evidence of her expenditure on the household or the children. Further, it was her evidence that she would set aside a sum of $500 per month for her father in Malaysia. Given that she was allegedly earning only $500 a month as a part-time shop assistant, any expenditure on the children would likely be minimal.

49     While the Mother did appear to have spent just perhaps a little bit more time than the Father, it did not appear that she was always present in the home for the children. Given that she was also working part-time, this would have reduced the amount of time she spent with the children, particularly when Jim was in childcare, and Cate in student care.

50     Parties married in 2006 and the children were born only in 2010 and 2012. The indirect, non-financial contributions of the Mother would be more pronounced from this period onwards. After all, the Mother had left her job initially to care for the children albeit against the Father’s wishes, though she apparently resumed work in 2016, drawing a gross salary of $2,300. It is not clear when she commenced her current job as a shop assistant or why she left her previous job, though it appeared from her affidavit that this was motivated by the need to care for her father, searching for good medical treatment for him, and caring for her children. But there was no visibility on what illness her Father had, and a paucity of evidence as to what her indirect contributions were in relation to caring for the children.

51     All things considered, I found that 51% to the Father and 49% to the Mother would be just and equitable in terms of their indirect contributions. In arriving at this ratio, I had also considered a sum of $3,000 which the Father admitted, he had taken from the Mother to pay off his losses in the stock market.

52     Applying _ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGCA 34</span>, the respective proportions of the asset pool was 70.5%, rounded down to 70% to the Father, and 30% to the Defendant. Given that this was a 10-year marriage and would be considered a somewhat long marriage, the trend is for the division to incline towards equality. However, given the absence of significant non-financial contributions on the Defendant’s part which would have assisted in raising the overall ratio, I believe the final ratio is just and equitable and does not require adjustment.

53     The Mother was adamant that the flat be retained and that the Father be refunded only $40,000 of his CPF monies. When asked how she would pay the instalments should she take over the flat, she responded she would pay cash and her CPF monies. She also intended to lease a room out to a friend.

54     I ordered that the Mother was to purchase the Father’s share of the flat by way of sale for the sum of $252,659.90, within 9 months from the date of my orders. This sum represented the Father’s share of the assets after deducting the assets held in his sole name.

55     In the alternative, the matrimonial flat would be sold should the aforesaid transfer fail to take place, and the net sale proceeds used to first refund into parties’ respective CPF accounts the principal CPF monies and accrued interest thereon, and thereafter divided 70:30 to the Father and Mother respectively. Any shortfall to the Defendant to satisfy her share of the asset pool fixed at $135,491.58 (after deduction of assets in her sole name), would be paid by the Plaintiff within a year of my orders.

## Maintenance for the Wife

56     The Mother sought maintenance for herself and while no quantum was stated, it appeared that she wished for the interim maintenance order of $200 previously ordered to continue.

57     As the power to award spousal maintenance is supplementary to the power to divide assets (_ATE v ATD_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGCA 2</span>), I found that since the Mother would be having an asset to her name, or a relatively sizeable sum of monies paid to her should the flat be sold, there was no need to award her maintenance.

58     Besides, at 40 years old, the Mother was able-bodied and self-sufficient. She obviously could earn more than $500 per month, given that her last drawn gross salary was $2,300 in May 2016 working for a government agency. She also had a Diploma in Administration from Malaysia.

## The Children’s maintenance

59     The Mother sought for the Father to pay a sum of $1,200 as maintenance for both children. However, the Mother’s breakdown of the children’s expenses came up to only $823. What was also glaring was her very unrealistic estimates for the children. For instance, for food, her monthly estimate for Cate was $100 and for Jim, $50. These were children who were 7 years old and 5 years old at the time the Mother filed her affidavit of assets and means. Yet the Mother’s own estimate for her food was $400. This was consistent with the finding that the Father paid for everything in the household such that the Mother was unaware of how much it cost to feed the children, and also reinforced the impression that the Mother was not the most organised in running her life.

60     Given the order of shared care and control, I was of the view that the parties should maintain the children when they are in their respective care. However, it was clear that the Father was drawing a higher salary than the Mother, and would continue to do so. I thus ordered that given the present disparity in parties’ incomes, for a period of one year from the date of my orders, the Father would pay to the Mother the sum of $500 as maintenance for both children. This was based on the Father’s estimates of $250 for each child’s food in his affidavit, which I found to be reasonable. The Mother ought to be able to find a job in a year’s time and support the children when they were with her.

61     Also, it was a matter of eventuality before bigger ticket items like tuition and enrichment would arise. I was of the view given parties’ earning capacities, these bigger ticket items ought to be fully borne by the Father provided he consented to such classes. Should he not consent to such classes, he would bear 69% of such expenses. This proportion was based on the Mother’s last drawn gross salary of $2,300, and the Father’s present gross salary of $5,191.

62     The rationale for the above orders was to encourage parties to co-parent. Parties were also ordered to consider re-enrolling the children at the student care to provide structure for the children.
