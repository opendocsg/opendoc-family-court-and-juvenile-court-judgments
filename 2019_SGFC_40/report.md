Ancillary matters, division of assets and maintenance for wife and child

20 March 2019

### District Judge Toh Wee San:

## Background

1       This is an appeal by both parties against my decision in respect of the ancillary matters pursuant to their divorce.

2       This was a 4-year-old marriage between a young couple when it ended. They had a young child aged about 4 years old when I heard them. The plaintiff wife (W) and defendant husband (H) were married in December 2012. They have a daughter born in April 2014. Around early 2015, the marriage broke down due to H’s unreasonable conduct. H had a girlfriend (GF) outside the marriage. W left H and brought their child along with her. W commenced divorce around October 2016 and interim judgement was granted on 27 April 2017. They could not agree on their ancillary matters and I heard their ancillary matters after hearing them. W appealed against my decision in respect of the division in assets, access arrangement to the child and costs. H appealed against my decision in respect of the access arrangement. The relevant orders are annexed and I provide my reasons below.

## Issue 1: Division of matrimonial assets

##### Parties’ positions in brief

3       Parties did not dispute the values of the assets in each of their sole name. They have one joint bank account with no money left. H’s case was for each to retain assets in his or her sole name. How-ever H pointed out that W withdrew substantial family savings of $ 25 798.45 and left nothing in the account. The monies were transferred to her personal account. H wanted 50% of the monies to be returned to him.

4       W’s case was she had withdrawn the monies to protect them from being used by H for his GF. H was splurging on branded bags for his GF. W also said that she contributed to 50% of the joint account. More-ever since separating from H in February 2015, W had used up the monies for the child’s expenses. W also wanted 80% of H’s CPF monies to purchase a property. H disagreed as he argued that they never had a joint property after marriage. They were staying with H’s parents until W took their child away unilaterally. More-ever W had more assets in her name than him. Their HDB flat had also been cancelled and payments made forfeited.

## Decision and reasons

5       I applied the relevant laws[^1] and divided the matrimonial assets as set out below. As this was a short marriage and taking into consideration the monies taken by W as well as the financial loss suffered by both sides from the surrender of the flat, I opined that it would be just for parties to be attributed an equal share for their indirect contributions.

6       If W has final care and control over the child, I was prepared to give W another 3% of the total pool of assets. In order to retain assets in each sole name and possession, W would need to give H about $8 000 to $12 000[^2].

## Issue 2: Maintenance for W and child

7       I ordered H to maintain the child for $700 per month. Both sides did not appeal against this order.

## Issue 3: Care and Control, Access Over the Child

8       I ordered joint custody over the child and no appeal was lodged against this decision.

## Parties’ positions in brief

9       W wanted sole CC over the child and at most supervised access for H. W alleged that H was under police’s investigation for molesting the child. The accusation was H had been touching the child’s private parts and his conduct had a negative impact on the child which led to her displaying emotional damage and abnormal behaviour with regards to her private part. W also alleged that H displayed cunning conduct such as contesting the divorce initially even in the face of clear evidence of his affair, leaving W after the confrontation between H and his family after they found out about H’s GF and applying for access to the child so that H’s parents can see the child rather than him wanting to see the child. W also argued that H was not a credible witness in respect of his present employment.

10     H asked for joint CC of the child as she is still very young. H alleged that the care-giver for the child was his parent(s) as W was a working mother and whom W and the child were residing with before W took the child away and denied H and his parents access. H argued that he always tried to get meaningful access to his child and this was supported by his application and the interim access order granted to him before the current proceeding.

## Decision and reasons:

11     I applied the relevant laws[^3] and was persuaded to allow H supervised access. Around May 2018, I had ordered for custody evaluation (CE) to be carried out when parties were filing their papers for the AM hearing. I received a confidential CE report from the relevant expert[^4]. However subsequent to this, W went to the police against H re possible wrong-doings against the child and applied for changes to H’s access to the child which I had dealt with and completed. I was also notified by parties’ counsels that the Child Protection Unit (CP) under the relevant Ministry has been notified about the matter. Hence I also requested CP to investigate and report to me for the purposes of the child’s issues in my hearing.

12     I received CP’s confidential report and was satisfied that there were no wrong doings made out against H. I accepted the CP’s report and recommendation as they were independent, credible and reasonable. In addition, there was no criminal conviction secured against H for the alleged offence. After considering CP’s recommendation, I ordered H to commence supervised access with the child and will continue to monitor and review the case at the appropriate times. I recently ordered a second tranche of supervised exchange after receiving positive reviews from the first tranche, though this is not the subject of the current appeal. I had also ordered parties to attend counselling some time ago when hearing their various matters.

## Issue 4: Costs

13     Both sides argued for costs. W asked for $ 27 212.50 to be costs of the divorce and another $ 9500 for the AM matters. W claimed that H had contested the divorce even in the face of clear evidence of his unreasonable behaviour. H asked for costs as he claimed that W had filed unreasonable requests for interrogatory and discovery.

14     I ordered no costs. I accepted W’s position that H had initially contested the divorce but withdrew only after hearing W’s evidence. However, whatever potential costs to be ordered against H would be offset by the amounts computed under paragraph 6 which worked out to be about $ 10 000. As for the issue of costs regarding the interrogatory and discovery applications[^5], there was no clear winner. I had decided costs in the cause then. Again there was no clear winner for the final outcome. In the AM hearing, both sides did not get what they wanted squarely. In conclusion, I declined to order costs. I find this to be a very unfortunate case for the parties and their young child. I hope that parties would benefit from the counselling and initiatives ordered, find closure, move on from this painful past and put the child’s interest above all their differences.

[^1]: The applicable law is section 112 of the Woman’s Charter (WC) which empowers the courts to order division of matrimonial assets in such proportions as the court thinks is just and equitable and sets out the list of matters to be considered under subsection (2). It is also established case law that in determining how assets are to be divided, the “broad-brush” approach is preferred. In ANJ v ANK (2015) SGCA 34, the Court of Appeal (CA) introduced the structured methodology to assess the division of matrimonial assets.

[^2]: 67 – 58.5%= 8.5% or 67 – 61.5% = 5.5% of the total asset value.

[^3]: Section 125 of the WC and section 122 of the Guardian of the Infants Act i.e. the paramount consideration shall be the welfare of the child.

[^4]: This is permitted under section 130 of the Women’s Charter (WC).

[^5]: Summons 299/2018 and 781/2018.
