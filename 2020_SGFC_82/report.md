Family law – Personal Protection Order

6 October 2020

### District Judge Kathryn Thong:

## Introduction

1       In the present case, the applicant Mother, a homemaker, had filed for a personal protection order (“PPO”) for herself and her two sons, against the respondent Father.

2       At the material time, parties’ 14 and 17-year-old sons were residing with the Mother at a crisis shelter.

3       At the end of the trial, I ordered that a PPO be granted in favour of the Mother and her younger son, Moe, for a period of 18 months. As for the older son, Tyler, I found that there had been no evidence of family violence committed against him.

4       As I iterated in delivering my brief oral grounds of decision, I did not think that the Father was a violent person. However, the challenges brought upon by the perpetually tense home environment due to parties’ personalities, and caring for Moe, a special needs child, appeared to have triggered the Respondent to behave in a manner that unfortunately, in my view, amounted to family violence.

5       While parties no longer resided together, the Father had proposed the Mother and their sons return to the family home, a suggestion she rebuffed. Nonetheless, living arrangements of parties and their children are by nature dynamic and it was not improbable that parties would resume cohabitation. I found it necessary for the Mother’s protection to have a PPO.

6       Further, the issue of child access was a live one. Indeed, the Father complained of being deprived of access and alienated from the children, whilst the Mother countered that the children were not ready to see him. Judging from the multitude and nature of parties’ allegations against each other, it was likely that should the status _quo_ remain, any handover or matters related to access would be fraught with conflict and potentially result in family violence.

7       Overall, I found that a PPO for 18 months would provide sufficient protection for the Mother and Moe as some of the dust would have hopefully settled on parties’ divorce proceedings by then, with the attendant counselling and necessary orders made on access.

8       The names of the children in this judgment are pseudonyms.

## Background facts

9       Both parents are highly educated and had met as professionals in a global company in the mid-1990s.

10     After the children were born, the Mother ceased working and became a homemaker. From the Father’s affidavit, he appeared to be somewhat resentful over what he felt was her unilateral decision to quit her job.

11     Moe, parties’ younger son, has been diagnosed with sensory processing disorder, anxiety and depression, conditions for which he has had to see psychologists, psychiatrists and an occupational therapist. Tyler, their older son whom I did not issue a PPO for, also saw a counsellor on a fairly regular basis at the time of hearing.

12     In March 2020, the Mother left the matrimonial home and filed the present PPO application.

13     By the time of the hearing, parties had been married for 23 years.

## The parties’ respective cases

14     The Mother’s PPO application referred to a litany of incidents that ranged from actual physical violence on herself and the children, to “emotional psychological violence” on her and their sons.

15     In her written statements to the Court, she claimed the Father had physically hurt her in the early years of the marriage, but ceased after she learnt to defend herself against his physical acts of aggression.

16     The latest act of physical violence was in November 2019 when he “whacked” a laundry basket towards her chest, thereby bruising it. In her complaint form, she stated that the Father had been arguing with the family domestic helper over his laundry and the helper looked at the Mother. The Father then got upset, turned towards the Mother and “whacked” the basket against her chest.

17     Through the years, the Mother claimed that the Father would also belittle her, make her feel worthless, denigrate her, such as labelling her a “helicopter mum”, “evil” a “hypocrite” and mocking her Christian faith.

18     In relation to Moe and Tyler, the Mother harkened to the time when they were 3 months old, and would be “whack\[ed\]” on the head by the Father. In particular, there was an incident in December 2019 when the family was holidaying in Korea, and the Father hit Moe’s head repeatedly as he refused to put his ipad device away. She claimed that the Father had a penchant for hitting the children on their heads.

19     Apart from physical violence, she also alleged that the Father would emotionally blackmail the children. For instance, sometime in 2018 or 2019, when Tyler had threatened to call the police on the Father who was allegedly punching Moe, the Father countered that it would be Tyler’s fault that if the police were to take the Father away, and Tyler would be homeless and penniless.

20     The Mother also accused the Father of inflicting stress on the children, by speaking in aggressive tones and “interrogating” them over their schoolwork. The children were intimidated by him, as he would often shout and swear at them and pressure them to go along with his plans. Such pressure resulted in self-harm.

21     Stunned by the Mother’s allegations against him, in his affidavit, the Father denied the Mother’s allegations, portraying her as an unreasonable, demanding and domineering personality. He called her an “emotional and physical bully”, creating “chaos, tension and discomfort” for all around her until she got her way. Her idiosyncrasies apparently led to the family relocating thrice in the span of 10 years.

22     He also described her as being short tempered and reacting drastically towards situations, sometimes hitting him with her hands even in front of the children. She was especially “trigger-happy” in calling the police to settle parties’ disputes. For instance, in January 2020, the Mother called the police on Moe when he was throwing tantrums, traumatising Moe. Moe then threatened suicide.

23     In relation to the laundry basket incident, the Father stated that since 2016, parties had been doing their laundry separately, such that his clothes were in a separate basket from the rest of the family’s.

24     On that fateful day of the alleged laundry basket throwing incident, the Father had seen his empty laundry basket and wanted to ask the domestic helper if she was done washing his laundry.

25     The Mother saw this and before the helper could reply, the Mother walked over, causing the helper distress. According to the Father, this was because of the Mother’s insistence that only she gives directions to the helper and she would be enraged if the helper did not perform up to her expectations. The helper was thus afraid she would be scolded for appearing to have taken instructions from the Father.

26     True enough, the Mother started berating the Father for speaking to the helper and claimed that he was not to ask her to help him with his laundry. The Mother then picked up the Father’s empty laundry basket which was next to the washing machine. As the Father wanted the laundry basket back, he reached out for it, and that was when the basket dropped onto the floor from the Mother’s hands. The Father picked the basket up and asked the Mother why she was so upset. She did not respond, and he headed upstairs back to the room. He claimed to have been confused why she was making an issue out of nothing. That was all the Father recalled transpiring.

27     As regards the children, he described himself as loving the children dearly and enjoying a close bond with them. He exhibited photographs of himself with the children on various trips they had taken together, as recently as December 2019.

28     Between the both of them, he claimed it was the Mother who “tended to be the harsher disciplinarian”. [^1]According to him, the Mother would “lose her temper quite quickly and lash out at the children”. For instance, the Mother had in 2018 or 2019, in an argument with Moe, forcibly grabbed his phone and hurled it into a bin, causing it to crack.

29     He claimed that she had also subjected the children to exorcisms on several occasions, when the children were around 4 years old, by grabbing on to them and hovering over them, commanding that the devil leave their bodies. This was her method of disciplining the children which the Father described as “shockingly drastic, cruel…and damaging”.[^2]

30     The Father noted that due to Moe’s sensory processing disorder, anxiety and depression, Moe was given to blowing his temper and lashing out physically, by hitting, punching or biting himself and others. He could also throw items around him, resulting in many of his own possessions and household items being damaged.

31     The only way to get Moe to calm down was to either let the tantrum run its course and suffer the attendant damage to self, others and objects, or to “physically restrain him and attempt to coax him out of it.” In particular, the Father stated that:

> … Both the \[Mother\] and I had agreed that holding on to \[Moe\] and trying to calm him down was preferable as that, at the very least, ensured \[Moe\] would not be hurting himself. I would therefore hug \[Moe\] as best as I could and hold on to him while encouraging him to slowly regain his bearings. This was something done entirely with the \[Mother’s approval.

> Depending on how bad \[Moe’s\] fit was, I would struggle to hold on to him as he fought and fidgeted…[^3]

32     In fact, when it came to the discipline of the children, the Father claimed that he would prefer to discuss his responses with the Mother before carrying them out. Hence any disciplining of the children would have been something that he and the Mother agreed upon and found appropriate. There was no family violence inflicted on the children.

## My decision

33     In relation to the Mother’s allegations, the aforesaid incidents were really just the tip of the iceberg. The fact was that the Mother’s allegations against the Father in her written statements were verbose and often did not meet the definition of family violence in my view. Some may have even been considered trifling and petty. It did however underscore the immensely strained relationship parties appeared to have had with each other over for more than 20 years.

34     In any event, what I found to be most germane to the proceedings was (a) the laundry basket incident where a photograph of the injuries on the Mother’s neck was exhibited, and the domestic helper was called to testify, and (b) the recording of Moe being hit by the Father when the family was holidaying in December 2019, for which an official transcript was being produced.

##### These were the two incidents that stood out for this Court.

### The laundry basket incident sometime in November 2019

35     At trial, the Mother stated that she believed that as the Father was already angry with the helper, he then got angry with the Mother and as she was standing beside him, he pushed the empty basket towards her. She thought the throwing was deliberate given the Father’s anger at the time.

36     The Mother’s account was corroborated by the domestic helper, J. According to her, as the family was embarking on their holiday, there was a lot of washing of clothes that had to be done. As the Father had several questions for the helper, the Mother explained to him that J’s priority would be to do things for her and the children first. The Father then got angry and threw the basket towards the Mother.

37     J stated in Court that she was unsure if it was “intentional” and it could be that the Father meant to “give” it to the Mother. She was however certain that the basket had hit the Mother in the chest region. Subsequently she excused herself from the ugly scene and as she did so, she squeezed past the Father in a narrow space which upset him, and he took to scolding J.

38     Several diary entries were also produced by J. These entries set out several unhappy encounters she had had with the Father over various periods, and were meant to shore up the Mother’s case that the Father had anger management issues, and would also lash out at the helper, not just the family.

39     During cross-examination, the Father asked J why had she not detailed the account of the laundry basket incident. J responded that this was because it was merely something she had witnessed, not something she had directly experienced. Her diary entries related to matters good and bad, which happened to her. This throwing of the basket was an experience of the Mother’s, not hers.

40     When pressed further by the Father why had she not documented her being subsequently, scolded by him since that was something she experienced, she explained this was because it was her fault for insisting on squeezing past the Father knowing the limited space available.

41     The Father then pointed out to J other matters that she had documented in her diary, but were indirectly experienced by her. For instance, she had an entry stating that the Father had broken a photo frame. This had nothing to do with J, he asserted. J’s response was that in the aftermath, he had screamed at J to “clean up this s\*\*t”. The screaming had upset her.

42     The Father then stated there was an inconsistency between what the Mother stated in her complaint, and what J had claimed. In the Mother’s account, she herself was holding the basket whereas in J’s account, the Father was holding the basket.

43     To this, J explained that each party actually had a laundry basket with them. The Father charged J with plugging gaps in her evidence to which J replied that one could check footage from the closed circuit TV. There was however, no such footage produced by either parties.

44     During re-examination, J clarified that she could not recall if the Mother was holding a basket herself. Though this may have appeared to be an inconsistency, I found that this should not be taken against her. The incident had taken place some 7 months ago and did not directly concern her; she could not be expected to recall the minutiae of the event.

45     Overall, J was certain that the Father had thrust the basket towards the Mother, and in the same breath, was candid enough to state that it was unclear to her whether the Father had any malicious intent.

46     In my view, her evidence was internally consistent and she did not display signs of having been coached. While one could not discount the possibility that she had allied herself with the Mother, I found her to be unshaken by the cross-examination. I saw no reason to frame the Father. To the extent that it was the Father’s case that J had lied and/or had been coached, I did not think that he had established his case on the balance of probabilities.

47     The preponderance of evidence was such that I found the Mother’s version of events to be more probable than the Father’s. Besides, if she was indeed as infuriated with the Father for speaking with the helper as he claimed, there was no reason for the Mother to have to pick up the Father’s laundry basket before scolding him. In picking up the laundry basket, she would have intended to do something to it, for instance, throw it at the Father. After all, the Father’s evidence was that she was in a rage, which he claims, confused him. At trial he even claimed that she had also hit him[^4], an allegation absent from his affidavit.

48     In those circumstances and given the alleged histrionics of the Mother, I found it hard to believe as the Father claimed, that the incident had unfolded in the manner he described, where after scolding and even hitting him, the Mother simply let the basket fall from her hands onto the floor when the Father reached out for the basket, and the Father simply coolly went upstairs to his room. and the Mother’s and J’s accounts were more likely.

49     On the balance of probabilities, I found that it was more likely than not than given parties’ strained relationship, when the Mother suggested that the chores for her and the children’s were more important, this agitated the Father and in anger, he threw the basket towards her. Given that this was an empty basket by both parties’ accounts and presumably light, it could plausibly hit the Mother’s upper chest region when he thrust it towards her.

50     Even if the Father’s actions were not intended to hurt the Mother, I find that the Father had behaved in a manner which he ought to have known, would result in hurt, and did in fact, cause hurt.

### The 31 December 2019 incident of hitting Moe in Korea

51     The Mother produced recordings of the incident. The sum total of the Mother’s evidence was that the hitting was on or around the head region, as Moe was lying on the bed and watching the ipad at the time. Unhappy that he was using the iPad rather than sleeping, the Father started “whacking” Moe from left to right on or around the head.

52     The certified transcript of the recording – undisputed by the Father– read as such:

>   
| 

Male 1:

 | 

(Giggles)

 |
| 

Male 2

 | 

(Hit sound) (Agitated voice) I’m not playing, you have to go to sleep. (Hit sound) I’m not playing with you! (Shouting)

 |
| 

Female 1:

 | 

\[Father’s name\], don’t hit him.

 |
| 

Male 1:

 | 

(Giggles)

 |
| 

Male 2:

 | 

\[Moe\], this is not funny. This is not funny. (Exasperated voice) Give me the iPad.

 |
| 

Male 1:

 | 

Daddy

 |
| 

Male 2:

 | 

\[Moe\], give me the iPad (Agitated voice)

 |
| 

Male 1:

 | 

Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah (Hit sound)

 |
| 

Female 1:

 | 

Eh don’t hit him.

 |
| 

Male 2:

 | 

Stop it. This is bad behaviour \[Moe\]. This is very bad behaviour son.

 |
| 

Female 1:

 | 

Put under your pillow \[Father’s name\] \[Moe\], put under your pillow. Put under your pillow if not you fever again. You very sick have to put you in hospital you know?

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

(Male 1 denotes Moe; Male 2 the Father and Female 1, the Mother.)

 |

  
  

53     During her evidence in chief, the Mother had explained that Moe would giggle when he was hit either because he thought it was funny, or because he did not know how to express his emotions. It will be recalled that Moe has, amongst other things, sensory processing disorder.

54     When the Father asked the Mother rhetorically in cross-examination if Moe would actually giggle if he was hit, the Mother resolutely replied that yes, he would indeed giggle even if he was hit until perhaps, blood started coming out.

55     The Father replied that he did not remember hitting him:

>   
| 

Father:

 | 

Okay. So, I mean, where---where---what I would \[inaudible\]. Like I said, I don’t remember hitting him. If I actually hit him, I probably would remember, but what---what---what I’m---what I’m saying is if I actually did hit him, it’s probably with the conditions of \[inaudible\] to make sure that he gives me the iPad so everybody can go to sleep.

 |
| 

Mother:

 | 

On the head?

 |
| 

Father:

 | 

Alright. Okay, I mean, I---I don’t---I don’t remember that at all.

 |
| 

Mother:

 | 

I know.

 |
| 

Father:

 | 

Okay. Now, I’ll move on.[^5]

 |

  
  

56     During his examination-in-chief, the Father iterated his position on what transpired during this incident (which was not specifically dealt with in his affidavit):

>   
| 

Father:

 | 

I---I---I---I don’t remember hitting him on the head. I don’t think I did. I don’t---I don’t remember hitting any area but, um, the transcript says there’s a hitting sound, so it’s, uh---it’s possible that I---I spanked him but I wouldn’t spank him on the head. Um, so, to be honest, I don’t really remember that incident, uh, and---and I’m trying to figure out what happened from the transcript and the video---uh, and audio that, uh, was recorded, um, but, yah, I---even if I spanked him, I would not have been hitting him on the head. That---that doesn’t make any sense.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Now, have you ever hit him on the head?

 |
| 

Father:

 | 

No. Uh, so---so, uh, I mean, truthfully, you---you know, um, when we’re with each other, that kind of stuff, uh, hitting---hitting him as in like---like hitting him to hurt him has never ever happened.[^6]

 |

  
  

57     Under cross-examination, the Father attested that he had never hit the children to hurt them, but there would be playful jostling where he would hit them.

>   
| 

Mother:

 | 

Okay. So, you mentioned to the Honour that you never hit the children on the head? Never, as in never ever?

 |
| 

Father:

 | 

So, what does that, you know, in a playful way, when we’re jostling, but I have never hi---hit them on the head to hurt them.

 |
| 

Mother:

 | 

When you are playing and jostling, what does that mean? You mean you knock them on the head, do you punch them on the head lightly, but not---

 |
| 

Father:

 | 

But I’m not \[inaudible\]---

 |
| 

Mother:

 | 

on the head? What do you mean?

 |
| 

Father:

 | 

I definitely rap them on the head, you know, like--like I give them \[inaudible\].

 |
| 

Mother:

 | 

So, you never punched him on the head? Never --

 |
| 

Father:

 | 

I never---

 |
| 

Mother:

 | 

slapped him---

 |
| 

Father:

 | 

punch him.

 |
| 

Mother:

 | 

on the head?

 |
| 

Father:

 | 

No. But \[inaudible\]

 |
| 

Mother:

 | 

\[inaudible\]

 |
| 

Father:

 | 

No I did slap him one time. Uh, thank you. actually don’t remember whether it was in Australia or in Singapore, I just slapped him one time. He---he talked back and was defiant, I slapped him across the face one time, \[‘Tyler\], and he stopped immediately. So---yes. I just slapped one time. So---uh, I’m sorry. I slap him, it’s a \[inaudible\] punch.[^7]

 |

  
  

58     I found that the preponderance of evidence highly suggested that the Father had indeed hit Moe in or around the head. The official transcript revealed the Mother urging the Father to “stop hitting” Moe. There were repeated sounds of hitting noted, which the Father claimed he was trying to make sense of. As the Father conceded, if he had indeed spanked Moe, it would not have been on his head.

59     However, given that Moe was lying on the bed and on his side according to the Mother, slapping him on the head would elicit a more immediate reaction from a child engrossed with an ipad than any other part of the body.

60     Further, if the spanking was on any other part of the body other than that head – not that the Father proffered where else this could be – I do not think the Mother would have intervened in the way she did. After all, the Mother conceded at trial that she had also hit her children by smacking their legs and caning them. Her objection to the Father’s actions were thus more likely borne out of her concern that it was on the head, a vulnerable part of the body, and not so much the act of ‘hitting’. This was a theme that emerged during the trial, that she was perturbed by him electing to hit the children on their heads, of all places.

61     From the transcript and the Father’s own revelation when he was cross-examining the Mother, it was also quite apparent that his motivation in hitting Moe was for him to turn the ipad off so that everyone could sleep. The Father was agitated.

62     From the rather equivocal nature of his evidence, and given the circumstances prevailing at the time, I found that it was more likely than not, that the Father had hit Moe in or around the head, not so much to discipline Moe as a form of “measured corporal punishment” which was how the Father described his and the Mother’s parenting approach, but simply to get Moe to submit to his will.

63     But even if the Father had not hit Moe in or around the head, I found that the repeated hitting was unnecessary and unjustified given that Moe is after all, a special needs child. It did not appear that this was a case of Moe having an outburst and the Father needing to restrain him. The atmosphere was tense and I do not think the act of hitting was an act of benign discipline at the time either.

## Conclusion

64     The requirements for a PPO to be granted are trite. There must have been family violence committed or the likelihood of it being committed, coupled with the PPO being necessary for the protection of the applicant(s).

65     In the present case, I found that there were incidents that occurred that amounted to family violence, even if they may have seemed trifling to the Father such that he could not even recall the incident happening. It could well have been that family life was so tumultuous for the parties, that the incidents I have referred to and based my decision on, were unremarkable to the Father in the larger scheme of things. Indeed, a fairly recurring theme in the Father’s cross-examination and his affidavit was that the Mother had behaved deplorably towards the children. As I pointed out to him, the present application was her PPO application against him and it was of limited relevance, if any, whether she herself had inappropriately disciplined the children.

66     I believe the Father loves his children and is not the monster the Mother sought to portray him as. But given the family dynamics at the present time and Moe’s special needs, I found that a PPO was necessary.

67     As parties are no longer living together, I was of the view that the PPO should not be for longer than necessary and found that a period of 18 months would be appropriate, which is when I think the divorce ought to have concluded as both parties are represented therein, and pertinently, any access issues should have been addressed even if not entirely resolved.

68     I also issued a counselling order for the parents and Moe, and iterated to the Mother that the PPO does not preclude the Father from having access to the children.
