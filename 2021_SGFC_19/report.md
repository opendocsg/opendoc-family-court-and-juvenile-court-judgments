Family Law – Ancillary Matters – Division of Matrimonial Assets – Maintenance of Wife – Custody of Children – Maintenance of Children

24 March 2021

### District Judge Lo Wai Ping:

## Background

1       These grounds of decision concern ancillary matters consequent upon divorce.

2       The plaintiff - husband (“**Husband**”) and the defendant - wife (“**Wife**”) were married in October 2008. The Husband, then 33 years old, had just started his pub business; the Wife, 21 years old, was a flight attendant.

3       During the marriage, the Wife gave birth to a boy (“**Son**”) in April 2010, and a girl (“**Daughter**”) in January 2013, (collectively, the “**Children**”). In December 2015, the parties quarrelled, and the Wife left the matrimonial home (“**Matrimonial Home**”). The Wife and the Children have since been residing with her parents at their HDB flat nearby whilst the Husband continued to reside at the Matrimonial Home.

4       The Husband initially tried to reconcile with the Wife. When it was clear that the parties were unlikely to reconcile, the parties tried to proceed with their divorce on a non-contentious basis and in the course of such attempt, they exchanged various text messages. Some of these messages from 13 April 2016 to 1 June 2016 (the “**Pre-Proceeding Messages**”) were exhibited by the Wife in her first affidavit filed for the hearing of the ancillaries.[^1]

5       During the school holidays in June 2016, the Husband, with the Wife’s agreement, took the Children on a cruise. Unfortunately, the Husband did not return the Children to the Wife on the agreed date. This resulted in the Wife lodging a police report against the Husband. Whilst the Daughter was returned to the Wife’s care in July 2016, the Son was not.

6       Following this unfortunate episode, the Husband commenced divorce proceedings in FC/D 3281/2016 in the middle of July 2016. This was followed very shortly by divorce proceedings commenced by the Wife in FC/D 3294/2016 (FC/D 3294/2016 was “consolidated” with FC/D 3281/2016, with the latter being the main suit).

7       In mid-July 2016, the Wife also took up an application (SUM 2408/2016) for the return of the Son and interim care and control of the Children. On 3 August 2016, the District Judge who heard SUM 2408/2016 granted the Wife interim care and control of the Children and ordered the Husband to return the Son to the Wife’s care.

8       Thereafter, the parties embarked on a rather acrimonious path towards the final dissolution of their marriage, with multiple interim applications, appeals, discoveries and interrogatories.

9       In April 2017, interim judgment for the parties’ divorce (“**IJ**”) was granted and their marriage of 8 ½ years came to an end. Then, the Son was 7 years old and the Daughter was 4 years old.

10     I first heard parties on their ancillary matters on 20 September 2019. The hearing was part-heard and I saw them again on 15 July 2020, almost a year later, after the Husband had withdrawn his 2 appeals relating to the divorce proceedings which were pending at the time of the hearing for the ancillaries in 2019. There were 2 further hearings before I delivered my decision on the ancillary matters (including the issues relating to the Children) on 30 September 2020. By then, the Children were 10 years old and 7 years old.

11     As regards my decision, whilst the Wife did not file any appeal against it, the Husband appealed against the entire decision. I now set out below, the full grounds of my decision. For ease of reference, I have also appended as **Appendix A**, a chronology of the key events in these proceedings.

## Issues

12     On the division of matrimonial assets, the issues before me included the following:

> (a)     whether the parties’ marriage was a dual-income marriage such that the structured approach adopted in _ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGCA 34</span> (the “**ANJ approach**”) was applicable?

> (b)     whether an adverse inference should be drawn against the Husband for his lack of full and frank disclosure of his income and assets?

> (c)     the determination of the assets that formed the pool of matrimonial assets including the value of the Matrimonial Home.

13     On the Children, the parties agreed to have joint custody of the Children. However, each party wanted to have sole care and control of the Children. As for access, the parties agreed that the current access arrangements of the Children during school holidays (including public holidays) and birthdays as set out in the order of court dated 6 June 2017 could continue to apply. However, the Husband asked for additional access time during the school term should he _not_ be awarded care and control of the Children. The Wife disagreed and contended that the Husband had more than adequate access time with the Children under the current schedule.

14     The issue of maintenance was also contested. The parties disagreed on the amount of maintenance payable by the Husband for the Children’s maintenance. As for spousal maintenance, the Wife wanted nominal maintenance of $1.00 per month. This was resisted by the Husband.

## Division of Matrimonial Assets

15     For the division of the matrimonial assets, the Husband submitted that the parties’ marriage was not a dual-income marriage and therefore the ANJ approach should _not_ apply. He further submitted that as the marriage was a short single-income marriage and he was the sole financial provider in the marriage, he should be entitled to 95% of the pool of matrimonial assets, with the balance 5% for the Wife.

16     The Wife’s position was that the marriage was a dual-income marriage and she sought a just and equitable division of the matrimonial assets.

## Single or dual income marriage

17     On the issue of whether the marriage was a single-income marriage or a dual-income marriage, counsel for the Husband referred to the following dictum of Judicial Commissioner Debbie Ong (as she then was) in _UBM v UBN_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHCF 13</span> at \[50\]:

>     “… It appears from the judgment in _TNL v TNK_ that a “Single-Income Marriage” would include a marriage where one party is primarily the breadwinner and the other is primarily the homemaker…”.

Counsel for the Husband highlighted the above-mentioned dictum with emphasis on the use of the words “primarily” and he submitted that the parties’ marriage was not a dual-income marriage as the Wife did not contribute financially to the household. The Husband’s case was that the Wife was largely unemployed during the marriage and that during the 2 ½ years when the Wife was employed as a flight attendant, she had used her income for her own spending rather than towards the household. The Husband tried to play down or discount the Wife’s employment and contributions in helping him at the Husband’s pub business operated under the tradename Shxxx (“**SH Pub**”). The Husband also submitted that the Wife was not a homemaker or not a stay-at-home mother as he was the one who did the house chores and looked after the Children with the assistance of the Wife’s family.

18     It was not in dispute that the Wife was working as a full-time flight attendant at the time of the marriage in October 2008 and that she continued to do so after marriage. In August 2009, the Wife resigned from her job as a flight attendant when she was pregnant with the Son whom she delivered in April 2010. Thereafter, she stayed home and looked after the Son. Sometime in 2011, she got back to work and helped the Husband at SH Pub 3 to 4 days a week. Her mother helped to look after the Son. The Wife was paid for her employment at SH Pub.

19     Sometime in 2012, the Wife had to stop work again for about 6 months. This time to help look after her mother who was diagnosed with cancer and to take care of the Son. In 2012, the Wife was also pregnant with the Daughter.

20     In January 2013, the Wife gave birth to the Daughter. She stayed home and looked after the Children full-time for another 6 months before going back to help the Husband at SH Pub. Hence, from June 2013 to November 2015, the Wife was helping the Husband at SH Pub. On her non-working days, the Wife looked after the Children. During the times when the Children were residing at her parents’ house, the Wife often stayed overnight at her parent’s house after work so that she could spend more time with the Children.

21     After she left the Matrimonial Home in December 2015, the Wife went back to work full-time in June 2016 as a flight attendant with a regional carrier. As at the date of IJ in April 2017, the Wife was still working as a flight attendant.

22     Hence, notwithstanding the periods when she did not work due to her pregnancies and after the birth of each child, I would consider the Wife to be a working mother during the course of the marriage. I did not agree with the Husband’s arguments that the Wife only worked for 2½ years on the basis that only the periods of her employment as a flight attendant should be counted and that her employment by SH Pub should be disregarded. In fact, the Husband had credited the Wife’s contributions to the business of SH Pub and he did not deny that the Wife was present at the business premises of SH Pub.

23     Due to her work at SH Pub, the Wife had to rely on her mother to look after the Children, and therefore, the parties paid the Wife’s mother a monthly sum of $800 for helping to look after the Children. The Husband did not deny that he had deducted $800 from the Wife’s monthly salary of $1,800 (paid by SH Pub) to pay to his mother-in-law on a monthly basis.

24     I noted that, and as agreed by the parties, the Wife had used monies in her CPF account for the purchase of their first matrimonial property at Rivervale XX (“**Rivervale Property**”) in December 2008. The Rivervale Property was registered in their joint names. In addition, the Wife had also used her CPF monies to pay for part of the mortgage payments for the Rivervale Property. Prior to moving into the Rivervale Property in February 2009, the parties were in fact living with the Wife’s parents in their HDB flat for a few months.

25     When the Rivervale Property was sold in 2012 with a profit, part of the proceeds of sale were used towards payment for the purchase of the Matrimonial Home (which was a property under development then) in March 2012 and registered under their joint names. Again, it should be noted that the Wife also contributed, upon the Husband’s request, cash for the payment of the booking fee and / or stamp duties to be made prior to the sale of the Rivervale Property in April 2012.

26     Therefore, I did not accept the Husband’s submission that the Wife had not contributed financially to the family and the household. I accepted that the Wife had done her part on this aspect and her financial contributions to the marriage were not insubstantial or negligible as alleged by the Husband.

27     Notwithstanding any disparity in the income of the parties and the quantum of their respective financial contributions to the household, I considered the parties’ marriage as a dual-income marriage with the Wife as a working mother. Accordingly, I applied the ANJ approach for the division of the matrimonial assets.

28     However, I was also mindful that the ANJ approach was not intended to be applied as a rigid mathematical formula and that the broad-brush approach was in no way replaced by it (_ANJ v ANK_ at \[24\] and \[25\]).

## Pool of Matrimonial Assets

29     Before applying the ANJ approach, I first had to determine the pool of matrimonial assets available for division.

30     The parties accepted that the IJ date (6 April 2017) was the operative date for determining whether an asset fell within the pool of matrimonial assets for division.

31     As for the valuation of the matrimonial assets, it was accepted that their values were to be taken at the ancillary matters hearing date on 20 September 2019 (“**AM Hearing**”) unless there were cogent reasons for not doing so. Where monies in bank accounts and CPF accounts were concerned, I accepted (and the parties agreed) that the values taken would be the balances in these accounts as at IJ date (or nearest to this date as adduced by the parties). Nevertheless, where parties agreed on a value for any matrimonial asset, I have used that agreed value in my decision.

## Agreed Assets in sole name

32     Based on the Wife’s 1st affidavit of assets and means (“**WAOM**”), the total value of her assets in her sole name as listed therein (comprising bank accounts, monies in her CPF accounts and an insurance policy) was **$63,126.78**. The Husband accepted this sum.

33     Based on the Husband’s first affidavit of assets and means (“**HAOM**”), the total value of his assets (excluding monies in his CPF accounts) in his sole name (as set out therein) was **$82,927.48**. In addition, the total amount of monies in the Husband’s CPF Ordinary Account, Medisave Account and Special Account was **$95,895.80**. The Wife accepted these 2 sums.

## Matrimonial Home in joint names

34     As at IJ, the main asset in the joint names of the parties was the Matrimonial Home. The parties could not agree on the market value of this property. At the AM Hearing, counsel for the Husband contended that the estimated market value of the property was about $1.2 million, whilst counsel for the Wife argued that it was about $1.285 million. As for the outstanding mortgage loan, the parties agreed that the amount was **$769,825.62** (based on bank documents as of 25 September 2019) and that this sum was to be deducted from the value of the Matrimonial Home as determined by this court.[^2]

35     At the AM Hearing, parties were directed to submit their supporting evidence by way of affidavits. The Husband submitted a valuation report prepared by Mr Teo Bxx Hxx of United Valuers Pte Ltd. Mr Teo was a licensed valuer and a member of the Singapore Institute of Surveyors and Valuers with more than 20 years of experience in the real estate practice. Mr Teo filed an affidavit enclosing his report wherein he had valued the Matrimonial Home at $1,190,000 (as at 30 September 2019).[^3] The basis and method of his valuation was set out in his report. He had used the “Direct Comparison Approach”. The report explained that this was where sales and listings of similar properties in the vicinity and elsewhere were used as guides to value after relevant valuation adjustments were made for differences in location, condition, date of sale, floor area, floor level, market conditions, age and other factors. Mr Teo listed in the report the transactions of a few units in _August 2019_ in the same development as the Matrimonial Home that he had used as guides in deriving his valuation of $1,190,000 as the open market value of the Matrimonial Home as at 30 September 2019. The Wife, on the other hand, did not obtain any formal valuation of the Matrimonial Home. Further, her argument that its estimated market value was higher at $1,285,000 was based on _one_ sale in _March 2019_ of another comparable unit in the same development. I therefore accepted the formal valuation report tendered by the Husband on the Matrimonial Home as evidence of its open market value closest to the AM Hearing.

36     After deducting the agreed outstanding mortgage loan of $769,825.62, the net market value of the Matrimonial Home was taken to be **$420,174.40.** I did not accept any other liability in respect of the Matrimonial Home for the reasons as set out in the later part of my decision.

## Assets in dispute

37     There were various assets in dispute.

38     It was the Husband’s case that he had provided full and frank disclosure of the assets owned by him in the list of assets in his HAOM. The Wife disagreed and at the hearing claimed that the Husband had not made full and frank disclosure on the following items:

> (a)     his CPF Investments;

> (b)     his investments in 2 condominium units (registered in the names of third parties), and

> (c)     his investments and interests in several pub businesses (including SH Pub and another pub business operated by the Husband under the tradename Inxxx (“**IN Bar**”)).

The Wife’s case as regards sub-paragraphs (b) and (c) above, and her investments in some of the items, were detailed in her affidavits filed for the ancillaries.

#### The Husband’s CPF Investments

39     On this issue, the Husband’s disclosed CPF statements dated 4 May 2017 showed that a total sum of $20,652.95 was used by the Husband from his CPF Ordinary Account (“**OA**”) and Special Account (“**SA**”) for investments. However, he did not disclose in his HAOM what these CPF investments were or provide details as to their returns. Subsequent CPF documents that were disclosed confirmed that the Husband was holding a CPF Investment Account No XX 6248-5 linked with the United Overseas Bank (“**UOB**”).

40     Although the Husband was ordered at the AM Hearing to explain all his CPF investments and their current values, and given time to do so, the Husband did not provide official documents from UOB explaining these matters properly and fully.

41     I did not accept the Husband’s bare allegation (in his affidavit of 12 December 2019) that his last investment transaction in relation to his CPF account was in 2007. He had in this affidavit simply exhibited a printout (undated and untitled) which he alleged was a printout of his investment activities linked to his CPF account and which he alleged was provided to him by a bank officer. There was no attempt to explain anything save to say that he was informed by the bank officer that his investments were last done in “2007”.

42     Subsequently, in February 2020, counsel for the Husband tendered to Court (vide correspondence) a letter from UOB dated 10 January 2020. First, this UOB letter contradicted what the Husband had said earlier. The UOB letter stated that his last transaction under his Investment Account was a “Sale of Insurance dated 18 December 2008”. Second, apart from the UOB letter, the Husband did not submit any further letters from the bank explaining clearly and fully what his CPF investments were and their values (as of AM Hearing). This was clearly something within his ability and control to obtain and he did not despite being ordered to do so.

43     Given the above, and based on the available CPF documentary evidence, I took the sum of $20,652.95 that was used by the Husband as the value of his CPF investments and included this sum as part of his sole assets.

44     I turn next to the Wife’s claims in **paragraphs 38 (b) and (c)** above. The Wife had made the following specific claims:

> (a)     that in October 2014, she and the Husband had invested in a condominium unit at Commonwealth Towers (“**CT Unit**”) which was purchased and registered in the sole name of Liew XX XX (“**Liew**”), a good friend of the Husband;

> (b)     that in August 2015, the Husband had also invested in another condominium unit at Botanique @ Bartley (“**Botanique Unit**”) which was purchased and registered in the sole name of Nxx Zxx Sxx (“**NZS**”), another good friend of the Husband;

> (c)     that in 2016, she and the Husband also had investments in a pub business operated under the trade name, The Pxxxx Enterxxxxx / The Pxxxx Exx (“**TPE**”), and

> (d)     that the Husband had given an incomplete and inaccurate picture of his assets and means by stating that he was just a mere employee of SH Pub (earning about $3,000 (net) per month) with no other assets or income from other sources.

On the above matters, the Wife made requests and filed several formal applications for discovery and interrogatories against the Husband and certain non-parties (the Husband’s friends who were involved in these matters together with the Husband). These applications started from the later part of 2017 and took up most of 2018.

#### The CT Unit

#### The Wife’s investment

45     On the CT Unit, the Wife averred that she contributed $59,000 towards its purchase. She also averred that she had invested in the said unit together with the Husband and Liew. The Wife said that the Husband and Liew had agreed that the property would be registered in Liew’s name. She knew that there was a trust deed executed by Liew for the property and she could even provide specifics as to the name of the law firm appointed to act for the purchaser of the property. The Wife said that she had handled the sum of $59,000 to the Husband in cash on 8 October 2014 and produced bank statements evidencing the withdrawal of $59,000 from her POSB bank accounts on that day.

46     The Husband had acknowledged the Wife’s investment in the CT Unit by way of text messages exchanged between them and set out in the Pre-Proceeding Messages, some of which are reproduced below:

> (a)     (at page 70 of WAOM)

>   
| 

**_Wife:_**

 | 

**_So I oready made my stand of wad I expected to get. The commonwealth tower jus return the 50k can Le_**

 |
| 

**_Wife:_**

 | 

**_If u got cash in hand I tink u return me the common wealth investment first. 50k_**

 |

  
  

> (b)     (at page 72 of WAOM)

>   
| 

**_Husband:_**

 | 

**W** **_hen e Commonwealth sold I tin u can lead an easy life after 5 years_** **…”**

 |
| 

**_Wife:_**

 | 

**…** **_Btw common wealth I m 50% of ur share_**

 |

  
  

> (c)     (at page 76 of WAOM)

>   
| 

**_Husband:_**

 | 

**_… We cant put e Commonwealth towers in. If u not happy, I return to u e principal sum same over 3 years…_**

 |

  
  

47     It should be noted that at the relevant time of the Pre-Proceeding Messages, the parties were trying to proceed with their divorce on a non-contentious basis. As such, I regarded the contents of these messages as reflective of the factual situation existing then on these matters and I gave due weight to them.

48     It was not in dispute that the Husband had paid a sum of $146,447 by way of 3 separate cheques issued by him towards the down payment and stamp duty for the purchase of the CT Unit:

> (a)     POSB cheque no. 481972 dated 3 October 2014 for $38,245 (for the 5% booking fee paid to the developers for the Option to Purchase);

> (b)     POSB cheque no. 481974 dated 5 November 2014 for $17,547 (for stamp duty paid to the Commissioner of Stamp Duties), and

> (c)     POSB cheque no. 481975 dated 19 November 2014 for $90,655 (for payment of remaining 15% of the down payment to the developers).

49     However, the Husband’s position was that he did not have any beneficial interest in the CT Unit. He claimed that the sum of $146,447 that he paid in connection with the purchase of the CT Unit, upon Liew’s request, was for the repayment of loans ($140,000) which he had taken earlier from Liew. Liew also filed an affidavit stating that the sum of $146,447 that the Husband had paid, by way of the 3 cheques, was the Husband’s repayment of a loan for an aggregate sum of $140,000 that he (Liew) had extended to the Husband over 3 years, from 2007 to 2009.[^4]

50     In his affidavit, the Husband had claimed that he had _lied_ to the Wife that he was purchasing the CT Unit with Liew in order to induce the Wife to give him the monies to repay Liew; he claimed that he had financial problems at the time in 2014 and that this was a “_seamless method_” to get his money back.[^5]

51     Further, the Husband also alleged that the monies that the Wife had handed to him were in fact his monies, held by the Wife on trust for him. However, other than his own bare assertion, there was no evidence of any trust over the monies that were given on 8 October 2014 by the Wife to him. It should also be noted that this was _not_ the position as reflected in the Pre-Proceeding Messages.

52     I therefore believed the Wife’s evidence that she had withdrawn $59,000 and handed the said sum to the Husband to invest in the CT Unit, and the Husband had acknowledged the receipt of such sum from the Wife for investment in the CT Unit and agreed he would repay the Wife. As such, I was of the view that the sum of $59,000 ought to be added back as part of the assets of the Wife.

#### The Husband’s investment

53     I turn now to the balance sum of $87,447 that the Husband had paid towards the down payment for the purchase of the CT Unit (being the difference between $146,447 and the Wife’s investment sum of $59,000).

54     Liew had filed 2 affidavits affirming that the Husband did not have any beneficial interest in the CT Unit. It should be noted that in Liew’s first affidavit (affirmed on 14 September 2018), he merely stated that the Husband had no beneficial interest in the CT Unit and that he (Liew) roughly paid over $100,000 towards the down payment using his own CPF monies.[^6] He did not mention anything about the repayment of a debt owing by the Husband to him. I also noted that when requests for discovery and interrogatories were served on Liew in February 2018, he did not mention about the debt owing by the Husband to him. In Liew’s first affidavit, he said that the CT Unit was introduced by the property agent named in his affidavit (“**Mr J**”) and that the agent had accompanied him to the show flat. But there was no mention of the Husband attending the show flat with him. I noted that the Wife had in her affidavits detailed how she and the Husband had both attended the show flat together with Liew and met Mr J, and that it was Mr J who had recommended the use of a trust deed and also the law firm who could help to prepare the trust deed.

55     In his second affidavit (affirmed on 9 November 2018), which was filed only after he was ordered to do so following a formal application for discovery of certain documents[^7], Liew explained that he had asked the Husband to issue the 3 aforementioned separate cheques for a total sum of $146,447, as payments made towards the down payment and stamp duty for the CT Unit. Liew explained that this was for the repayment of a debt of $140,000 owing by the Husband to him. It is noted that the sum of $146,447 was much higher than the $100,000 figure mentioned in Liew’s first affidavit. Liew mentioned in his second affidavit that he needed the Husband to issue the 3 cheques for the purchase of the CT Unit as _he did not have a cheque book_. He stated that all the loans he had extended to the Husband were _in cash_ from the _cash sales kept in the safe of his mother’s business_. According to Liew, over a period of about 3 years (2007 - 2009), he had extended cash loans of _about $170,000_ to the Husband, with no written acknowledgement of indebtedness by the Husband. A sum of $50,000 was extended in 2007 to assist the Husband when he bought SH Pub, another sum of $60,000 was extended for the Husband’s wedding in October 2008, and a further sum $60,000 was extended in 2009 for the Husband’s purchase of Rivervale Property.

56     Based on Liew’s explanation, a first sum of $10,000 was repaid in 2007/2008, followed by a sum of $20,000 (which was repaid by the Husband from the wedding’s collection). Hence, the total outstanding balance owed to Liew (since 2009) was $140,000. Yet, there was no repayment of this alleged outstanding loan of $140,000, even when the Rivervale Property was sold in April 2012 with a profit of $100,000. And, there was also no further loan repayment by the Husband for an additional two years up to October 2014.

57     As for the difference of about $6,400 between the alleged outstanding loan amount of $140,000 and the total sum of $146,447 (paid by the Husband towards the down payment for the CT Unit), it was conveniently explained by Liew and the Husband as an additional sum given by the Husband as a token of gratitude for Liew’s help.

58     Further, I noted that both Liew and NZS had given similar explanations in their affidavits as to why the Husband had to issue cheques for and on behalf of each of them. Liew had said it was because he did not have a cheque book, hence he needed the Husband to issue 3 cheques (for and on his behalf) in 2014 for his purchase of the CT Unit. NZS had also given this same reason for the Husband’s cheque payments for his purchase of the Botanique Unit one year later in 2015 (see **paragraph 67** below).

59     I therefore did not believe the Husband’s evidence that the balance sum of $87,447 contributed by him in 2014 in connection with the purchase of the CT Unit was for the repayment of loans owing to Liew and not for investment in the said property. Accordingly, I therefore added back the sum of $87,447 into the matrimonial pool as part of the Husband’s assets for division.

#### The Botanique Unit

#### The Husband’s investment

60     I turn now to the Wife’s claim that the Husband had invested in the Botanique Unit that was purchased in August 2015 for a purchase price of $634,000 and registered in the name of his good friend, NZS. The Wife’s evidence was that Mr J (the property agent) had introduced the Husband to this development. She had gone with the Husband and NZS to visit the showroom and on the same day, the Husband and NZS had agreed that they would both invest in the property and NZS had signed the purchase documents on that day.[^8] However, both the Husband and NZS denied that the Husband had any beneficial interest in the Botanique Unit.

61     Notwithstanding the position stated by the Husband and NZS, both admitted that the Husband had paid $43,757 towards the purchase of the Botanique Unit in September 2015. This was evidenced by 2 cheques dated 10 September 2015 (of **IN Bar**) signed by the Husband for the aggregate amount of $43,757:

> (a)     one cheque (for $30,100) was issued to the developer of the Botanique Unit, and

> (b)     the other cheque (for $13,657) was issued to the Commissioner of Stamp Duties.

Both the Husband and NZS admitted that in September 2015, IN Bar was owned by the Husband.

62     There was also however _another earlier cheque (POSB Cheque No.482003)_ issued in _July 2015_ to the developer for payment of the booking fee of $31,700 for the Option to Purchase the Botanique Unit. This cheque payment was stated clearly in the Option to Purchase dated 10 July 2015 produced by NZS.

63     Although discovery was ordered for this particular POSB cheque no. 482003[^9], NZS did not produce a copy of this particular cheque in his 2 affidavits or explain who made the payment. However, he later admitted in a reply email dated _1 November 2018_ addressed to the solicitors for the Wife (and copied to the solicitors for the Husband) that it was likely that this POSB cheque no. 482003 was also issued by the Husband.[^10]

64     It should be noted also that it was only in NZS’s second affidavit (18 October 2018) that he stated for the first time that it was the Husband who had issued the 2 later cheques referred to in **paragraph 61**. The Husband also affirmed an affidavit (on 16 October 2018) which was similar in content to NZS’s second affidavit on this issue. However, neither NZS nor the Husband mentioned the first POSB cheque No 482003 that was issued in _July 2015_ for the booking fee for the Option to Purchase.

65     In his affidavit, the Husband stated that he had issued the 2 cheques in September 2015 for a total of $43,757 upon NZS’s request as repayment of total loans of “_roughly $50,000_” owing to NZS. In his second affidavit, NZS also stated that the monies paid by the Husband ($43,757) were the repayments of loans previously extended by NZS to the Husband and the Husband had no beneficial interest in the Botanique Unit.

66     As mentioned earlier, the facts relating to the loans extended by NZS to the Husband were not mentioned in NZS’s first affidavit (17 September 2018), or at a court session attended by NZS on 13 August 2018. The loans were only disclosed for the first time in NZS’s second affidavit (18 October 2018).

67     In his second affidavit, NZS said that he had lent the Husband monies during the period from _2012 to 2014_ amounting to “_roughly around $50,000_” to help him with his business at SH Pub and, also for his home. NZS said that in 2015, he (NZS) had wanted to buy the Botanique Unit and as he did not have a cheque book, he therefore required the Husband’s help to issue the 2 cheques for him for the purchase of the Botanique Unit. NZS further said that he was prepared to accept from the Husband the sum of $43,757 as full repayment of the debt of about $50,000 owing by the Husband to him.

68     First, I had difficulty accepting NZS’s evidence on this point. NZS could have asked the Husband for the full $50,000 to be banked into NZS’s bank account and with the monies in his account, NZS could have obtained cashiers’ orders from the bank issued to the developer of the Botanique Unit and the Commissioner of Stamp Duties. The bank charges for the cashiers’ orders would have been very much less than the sum of $6,243 (which was the difference between $50,000 and $43,757).

69     Second, with NZS’s subsequent admission that the POSB cheque for the booking fee of $31,700 was paid by the Husband (because of NZS’s loans to him), the Husband would have paid a total of $75,457 for the said property. As such payments were supposedly for repayments of loans of “_roughly around $50,000_” owed to NZS, no explanation was given by NZS on the excess sum of $25,000 paid by the Husband and this would also be inconsistent with the evidence given by the Husband and NZS.

70     Further, neither the Husband or NZS provided any written supporting documents evidencing the loans owed by the Husband to NZS, or the discharge of those loans upon the issuance of the cheques.

71     All considered, I found the explanations of the Husband and NZS on this point contrived and I did not accept that the 3 sums totaling $75,457 paid by the Husband in connection with the Botanique Unit were for the repayment of loans owed by the Husband to NZS. I therefore added back the sum of $75,457 into the matrimonial pool as part of the Husband’s assets for division.

72     Therefore, the total sum that was added back as part of Husband’s assets amounted to **$162,904** ($87,447 for the CT Unit and $75,457 for the Botanique Unit). I decided that it would be just and equitable to require him to add back these sums into the pool for division as I did not accept the Husband’s explanation for his use of substantial sums of monies in connection with the purchase of the CT Unit and the Botanique. I wish to state that in deciding to add back this sum into the pool of matrimonial assets, I was not making any determination on the beneficial ownership of the CT Unit and / or the Botanique Unit. The parties had been given the opportunity to take up separate applications to determine the issue of the beneficial ownerships of CT Unit and or the Botanique Unit but had decided not to do so.

#### The TPE

#### The Wife’s investment

73     The Husband had denied that he had any interest in TPE. NZS, who was reflected as the registered owner of TPE, also affirmed the Husband’s position in his affidavits. However, the Wife alleged that on or around _March 2016_, she had invested the sum of about $18,000 in TPE. The investment opportunity was offered to her by the Husband. The Husband had also acknowledged the Wife’s contribution of $18,000 by way of text messages set out in the Pre-Proceeding Messages. The Pre-Proceeding Messages showed that the Husband had agreed to return her the sum of $18,000. As shown in the Pre-Proceeding Messages, the parties were then negotiating, _inter alia_, on the repayment by the Husband to the Wife of the $18,000 that the Wife had invested in TPE.

74     While the Husband did not deny that the Wife had invested $18,000 in TPE, the Husband claimed again that he had _lied_ to the Wife in _March 2016_ that there was an investment opportunity in TPE so that he could get back his monies which she allegedly held on trust for him.[^11] This was another bare assertion on the Husband’s part. It was also contradicted by the contents in the Pre-Proceeding Messages. Some of these messages are set out below:

75     Based on the Pre-Proceeding Messages set out above, the Husband had invested in TPE and the Husband had the power to dispose of TPE.

76     All considered, I therefore believed that the Wife had invested $18,000 in TPE and based on the Pre-Proceeding Messages, the Husband had agreed to return her the $18,000 upon the disposal of TPE. Accordingly, I added this sum of $18,000 to the matrimonial pool as part of the assets of the Wife for division.

77     In total, I therefore added back $77,000 comprising $59,000 (for the Wife’s investment in the CT Unit) and $18,000 (for the Wife’s investment in TPE) to the pool of matrimonial assets held by the Wife.

## Adverse inference against the Husband

78     It is clear that parties in divorce proceedings have a general duty, owed to the courts, to make full and frank disclosure of all relevant information within their knowledge, and this is particularly relevant in the context of the division of matrimonial assets. This was emphasised by the Court of Appeal in _BG v BF_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 3 SLR 233</span> at \[52\].

79     It is also clear that the Court may draw an adverse inference against a party who has failed to discharge his duty to provide full and frank disclosure if the following is shown (see _Koh Bee Choo v Choo Chai Huah_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] SGCA 21</span> at \[28\]):

> (a)     there is a substratum of evidence which establishes a _prima facie_ case against the person against whom the inference is to be drawn; and

> (b)     that person has some particular access to the information he is said to be concealing or withholding.

80     As for the first of these requirements, there must be some evidence which suggests on its face that the party in question has deliberately sought to conceal or deplete some assets which would otherwise be available for division: see _BOR v BOS_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGCA 78</span> at \[75\].

81     As mentioned earlier, on the issues relating to the Husband’s assets and income, the Wife had taken up several applications for discovery and interrogatories. The Wife alleged that the Husband had not made full and frank disclosure with regards to his interests and investments in his various pub and other businesses. She alleged that the Husband was actively involved in the management of and / or had interests in at least 13 pub businesses during the marriage. She also claimed that the Husband’s alleged sale of SH Pub and IN Bar in 2016 to Exx Nxx (“**ENG**”), a good friend of the Husband, was not a genuine one. I will deal with the evidence provided on SH Pub and IN Bar first.

#### SH Pub and IN Bar

82     SH Pub was located in the Central Business District. This was the pub business that the Husband took over and operated from June 2007.

83     SH Pub was allegedly sold by the Husband to his good friend, ENG, for $50,000 in October 2016. ENG had adduced a sale and purchase agreement dated 1 October 2016 (“**SPA**”) signed by the Husband and him, and a letter of employment dated 1 October 2016 signed by him, as evidence that he was owner of SH Pub from _1 October 2016_ and that from that date, the Husband was employed as manager of SH Pub.[^12] The Husband in his first voluntary affidavit of 4 December 2017 (“**1VA**”) also stated that he had ‘_commenced employment in SH Pub sometime around October 2016_”.[^13]

84     However, as pointed out by the Wife’s counsel, there were pay slips signed by ENG and the Husband (exhibited in his HAOM) to evidence that the Husband was an employee of SH Pub from _June 2016_, which contradicted the alleged letter of employment dated _1 October 2016_ signed by ENG.

85     The contents of the letter of employment were also rather curious. It was adduced by ENG and the Husband as the _contract of employment._ First, the letter of appointment was addressed “_To whom it may concern_”. Second, it contained _no terms_ as to the remuneration of the Husband in his appointment as manager of the pub. Third, two (2) different versions of this alleged contract of employment dated 1 October 2016 were presented by ENG and the Husband. The duties and work schedules were different in both versions. The version shown in the Husband’s IVA as “_his employment contract_” had an express provision on the termination of service with a month’s notice and also provided that he was authorised to manage the accounts on behalf of the company as part of his duties. The version exhibited by ENG in his affidavit did not have these express provisions, but it had instead a long provision relating to the entire agreement between the Husband and SH Pub.[^14]

86     To explain the inconsistencies in his pay slips disclosed earlier and the employment contract disclosed subsequently, the Husband stated in his second voluntary affidavit of 16 August 2018 (“**2VA**”) - that he had “_already decided to sell \[SH Pub\] to \[ENG\] in_ _June 2016_ _so he started to draw a salary from the business_”. This version (that he had sold SH Pub in June 2016) was repeated by the Husband in his third voluntary affidavit of 1 February 2019 (“**3VA**”).

87     In addition, it was also highly unusual and perplexing that the Husband would continue to allow his _personal bank account_ to be used for the receipts and payments for SH Pub’s business when he had allegedly sold SH Pub in _June 2016_ (which was one month before he filed for divorce). Similarly, no explanation was given as to why ENG, the new owner of SH Pub would allow the receipts of SH Pub to be deposited into the Husband’s personal account and with the Husband having control over the said account. The Husband claimed that he was authorized by ENG to manage the accounts of SH Pub.[^15]When ENG was ordered to produce the letter of authorisation, he said there was no such letter.[^16]

88     On the sale of SH Pub to ENG for $50,000, the Husband explained that he had needed money for his legal fees and that SH Pub was not doing well. However, it was noted that the SPA did not provide any details on the payment of the purchase consideration. When asked to provide documentary evidence of this payment, the Husband stated (in his 2VA) that the purchase consideration was paid to him in _cash_ and _over a period of about 9 months_. The SPA did not stipulate any definite payment dates or the instalment sums. This was highly unusual as the Husband had stated that the ‘_outright’_ sale of SH Pub and IN Bar was because he was in need of money at the time.

89     In his 1VA, the Husband claimed that prior to the sale of SH Pub, his monthly income would vary from $1,000 to $5,000. This worked out to an annual income of between $12,000 and $60,000. After the sale of SH Pub and IN Bar to ENG, the Husband claimed that he drew only a net monthly salary of $3,000 (without any other form of consideration or commission) as a general manager of SH Pub. He also stated that he had no other sources of income.

90     Based on the Husband’s evidence regarding the CT Unit and the Botanique Unit, he would have disbursed a total of about $220,000 in the course of 12 months between 2014 and 2015 for the account of Liew and NZS. This was made up of $161,000 directly from his funds or funds controlled by him (including cheques issued by IN Bar) and the sum of $59,000 contributed by the Wife which he claimed to be provided by him and held on trust by the Wife. While the Husband claimed that he had obtained financial assistance from his brother (“**YTL**”) to help pay for the mortgage payments for the Matrimonial Home _commencing from September 2015_**[^17]**, he did not say that he had any other borrowings from any other persons. Therefore, the above would contradict the Husband’s evidence (a) that SH Pub had only earned between $12,000 to $60,000 per year, and (b) that the business of SH Pub was bad.

91     I turn next to the evidence on IN Bar. The Husband claimed that he had sold SH Pub together with IN Bar to ENG and that IN Bar held the “_account of credit cards machine only_”. He said this was evidenced by the SPA which also stated that (a) IN Bar was “_inactive in operation_” and (b) the Husband was a director of IN Bar.

92     ACRA searches done in September 2016 showed that IN Bar was a live company and that the Husband was an owner of the business since _15 May 2007_ (the same day that the Husband took over and became owner of SH Pub).

93     In his affidavit of 30 November 2016, the Husband claimed that IN Bar had “_closed but has yet to be dissolved_” and that he “_does not earn any money from this business_”. But he did _not_ mention anything about a sale of IN Bar in this affidavit. What he stated however was that he had sold off SH Pub “_as of September 2016_” and was employed as a manager at SH Pub. He exhibited pay slips in September to November 2016 in support.[^18] This contradicted his later affidavit evidence (in 2VA and 3VA) that he had _by June 2016 sold off SH Pub together with IN Bar_. If the Husband had indeed divested his interest in SH Pub and IN Bar by June 2016 , he would have stated so in this affidavit affirmed on 30 November 2016 as this affidavit was to answer the Wife’s application in SUM 3524/2016 for interim maintenance for the Children and his means and capacity to provide maintenance were in issue then.

94     In his HAOM affirmed on 10 July 2017, the Husband claimed again that he did not earn any monies from IN Bar. To support his claim on this, the Husband exhibited an old letter from IRAS (dated in December 2010) stating that IRAS records showed that the “_partnership IN Bar has not carried out any business activity in the Years of Assessment 2009 and 2010_”. This merely referred to the period of 2 years in 2008 and 2009. This 2010 letter was not evidence that there were no business activities or income earned by IN Bar subsequently.

95     On the contrary, and importantly, the discovery ordered against NZS in SUM 2576/2018 in respect of the Botanique Unit revealed that in _September 2015_ (which was less than 12 months before he filed for divorce in July 2016), the Husband had in fact issued _2 cheques of IN Bar_ for an _aggregate sum of $43,757_ for payment towards the purchase of the Botanique Unit. This was not an insignificant sum in IN Bar’s accounts.

96     Further ACRA searches conducted on 6 October 2017 also showed that the Husband only ceased to be an owner of IN Bar on “12 June 2017” (not October 2016 or June 2016), and that on the same day 12 June 2017, ENG became an owner of IN Bar. Also, IN Bar was constituted as a partnership and the other co-owner was the Husband’s brother (YTL) who had been a co-owner of IN Bar since 23 March 2008.[^19] There was no record in these searches of YTL having ceased to be a partner at any point in time.

97     And, when the Wife asked for discovery of the financial documents and management accounts of both SH Pub and IN Bar, these were not forthcoming. The Husband stated (in his Notice In Response) that all the records of SH Pub and IN Bar belonged to ENG, and that ENG did not want to produce any of them and that ENG would file an affidavit to explain in due course.[^20] The Husband also said that he did not keep accounts as he was sole proprietor of SH Pub, and as for IN Bar, it was a dormant company.[^21] Later, in his 2VA, the Husband gave another reason for not producing the documents ordered – that ENG had thrown away all past records of SH Pub and IN Bar due to the renovation works that ENG was preparing to carry out around the end of 2017. He also stated that he could not get any of these documents from ENG and he also had no rights to them as SH Pub had been sold.

98     As for ENG, when he was ordered on 13 August 2018 (pursuant to SUM 2575/2018[^22]) to produce the financial statements and management accounts of SH Pub and IN Bar and to answer certain interrogatories relating to his purchase of the 2 entities and its profits, he claimed (in his affidavit of 11 September 2018) that he did not do any proper accounting or financial statements for SH Pub, that he only did basic daily sales reports, and that IN Bar was a dormant company with “_no revenue or expenses_”. He claimed that his yearly profit in 2016 and 2017 was “_around $25,000 or $30,000_” but he “_just did a renovation_” so most of his “_previous statements, sales book etc had been cleared away_”. In short, nothing was produced by the Husband and ENG which could have provided the Court with information to assess the value of the businesses for these ancillary proceedings. I agreed with the Wife’s submission that the financial statements and management accounts of SH Pub and IN Bar would have informed the Court of the financial health and value of both businesses, which would have assisted the Court in its evaluation of the ‘sale’ to ENG. Counsel for the Wife submitted that if the two businesses were doing well and clearly worth more than the sum of $50,000, it would undermine the Husband’s evidence on their sale.

99     Finally, I also noted that ENG had previously worked with and for the Husband for various pub businesses (including SH Pub) as reflected in the email correspondences between them.[^23] Of note were also the emails sent by ENG to the Husband as regards work matters for TPE in 2016. It was therefore highly unlikely that for a transaction such as a “sale” of SH Pub together with IN Bar, that ENG and the Husband would have discussed everything _orally_ as they had both claimed.

100    Based on all the inconsistencies set out above with regards to SH Pub and IN Bar, I found the credibility of the Husband an issue.

#### TPE

101    On TPE, Husband stated in his 1VA that he helped as a consultant for TPE when it first started. The Husband stated that he did not invest monies in the said business. He said that NZS was the owner of TPE, but in the same affidavit, he contradicted himself by saying that he had helped NZS in getting his brother YTL and 2 others to invest in TPE.

102    The Husband then went on to explain that he had helped NZS in TPE because his brother YTL had a stake in it. He said that he had ceased helping out in TPE in 2018. In his 1VA, the Husband did not deny his involvement in TPE. However, he denied any relationship between TPE and SH Pub and stated that for all his help to NZS on TPE, he had only received a _single_ ‘hongbao’ of $1,000. This was inconsistent with the position stated in the Pre-Proceeding Messages which indicated that he was taking over TPE and that he had power to sell and dispose of TPE. He had also promised to repay the $18,000 invested by the Wife in TPE when TPE was sold.

103    In his affidavit of 18 October 2018, NZS stated that he took over TPE on 1 April 2016 but had transferred it to one Hxx Txx Hxx on or about 31 May 2018 as it was not making money. I noted the submission by the Wife’s counsel that this transfer in May 2018 was effected after requests for discovery and interrogatories of NZS were made on 9 February 2018 and formal applications for the same were filed on 4 April 2018.[^24] When NZS was ordered to produce the TPE’s accounts, NZS claimed that he had also thrown away TPE’s management accounts for 2016 and 2017 as TPE had been sold.[^25] Counsel for the Wife submitted that NZS’s actions in transferring TPE to another party and in not complying with the discovery orders were clearly intended to prevent the Court from making a proper appraisal of TPE’s value for these proceedings. This was not unlike the situation in the alleged sale of SH Pub and IN Bar by the Husband to ENG.

104    Finally, in her second ancillary matters affidavit of 1 April 2019 (“**WAOM2**”), the Wife also adduced extracts from the Husband’s notebook (“**Notebook**”) which contained his handwritten scribbles on the following: (a) work rosters planned by him; (b) his notes on the hours each employee worked and the salaries payable to each employee, and (c) a list of tasks (dated 22 August) to be done such as paying bills and rental and other expenses.[^26] The list of to-do tasks was on the first page of the Notebook. I accepted the Wife’s evidence here that all the said content in the Notebook together showed that in 2017, the Husband was actively involved in the management of TPE, SH Pub and a pub business referred to in the Notebook as “FATBAR”. Based on the Wife’s evidence, the references in the Notebook to “TPE” referred to TPE and “SB” referred to SH Pub. And as for “FATBAR”, the Wife stated that this referred to a pub business operating under the trade name Fxt Bar at XX Upper Serangoon Road (“**FT Bar**”) and the references to “FB” and “FAT” in the Husband’s to-do list, rosters and notes in the Notebook were all references to that same pub business.

105    The evidence given by the Husband on TPE was also taken into consideration in the overall assessment of his credibility.

#### Other Non-disclosures

106    It was also noted that pursuant to the various applications for discovery and interrogatories taken out by the Wife, the Husband admitted that he had received and was still receiving the following payments which he had _not_ disclosed in his HAOM:

> (a)     a monthly sum of $1,000 from Bxx Cxx Pte Ltd (“**BC Pte Ltd**”);[^27]

> (b)     a monthly sum of $1,000 from Wxx Hxx Entertainment (“**WH Entertainment**”).[^28]

It was also disclosed that the Husband had previously received monthly sums during the marriage from Xxx Sxx Lou (“**XS Bar**”), Wxx Bar (“**W Bar**”) and Kxx Gxx Holdings Pte Ltd (“**K Company**”) for his help in setting up the pub businesses operated by these 3 entities (although according to him these payments have since ceased).[^29]

107    In addition, there was evidence that the Husband was also involved in the following businesses:

> (a)     He was a partner and manager of a pub business Sxx Axx LLP (“**SA LLP**”) which he had set up in _January 2011_. Whilst he had claimed that this business had closed, ACRA records showed that it was still a live business and the Husband, its manager and partner as of _February 2019_.[^30]

> (b)     In or around 2013, he was involved in another business known as Club Wxx Pte Ltd (“**Club W**”) and held at least a management position in it as evidenced by the contract documents and email correspondence adduced in the Wife’s WAOM2.[^31]

> (c)     In 2016, he was managing a pub business known as Dxx Ixx (“**D Inn**”) located at XX Yio Chu Kang Road. He had acknowledged this in his 30 November 2016 affidavit filed in SUM 3524/2016.[^32]

> (d)     In 2017, as evidenced by the contents in his Notebook, the Husband was involved in the management of a pub business known as **FT Bar**.

108    Despite being ordered to do so, the Husband refused to provide statements of his **POSB SAYE** account. In his HAOM (at paragraph 8), the Husband disclosed the existence of one (1) POSB account (ending 1466) (“**1466 Account**”) apart from two (2) UOB savings accounts. The statements of the 1466 Account showed that _between April 2012 to March 2016_, a monthly sum of _$3,000_ was transferred from this account and credited to his **POSB SAYE** account.[^33] The total amount credited was $144,000 ($3,000 x 48 months). The above contradicted what the Husband stated in his Notice in Response to the Wife’s further discovery - that he faced “_financial difficulty_” in 2014 and was unable to continue to make payment into the POSB SAYE account. The Husband then stated that his POSB SAYE account was closed in March 2016 and that the bank statements for the said account were not retrievable.[^34] Other than his bare assertion that the statements were not retrievable, he did not provide any documentary evidence from the bank to support his statement.

109    The Husband also failed or refused to provide any bank statement of his personal current account (“**POSB CA**”), which was linked to the 1466 Account. It was highlighted by the Wife that he had made significant withdrawals (vide fund transfers) from his 1466 Account to his POSB CA in April 2016 and also from June 2016 to November 2017. These withdrawals amounted to about $300,000. Counsel for the Wife submitted that the statements of his POSB CA would be relevant to assist the Court to determine his true means and assets. Again, despite being ordered to do so, the Husband did not provide the bank statements of his POSB CA, and simply asserted in response that he was orally told by the bank that there were no such bank statements.[^35]

110    Finally, as was mentioned earlier, the Husband had also not provided as ordered, formal documentary evidence from UOB explaining what were his CPF Investments and their values as of AM Hearing.

111    On the totality of the evidence adduced before me and on a balance of probabilities, I found that the Husband had not provided full and frank disclosure of his assets and means for the purpose of the division of matrimonial assets, and therefore drew an adverse inference against him.

## Valuation of pool of matrimonial assets

112    Based on the agreed assets and my findings above in respect of all the other items which were in dispute, I had determined the value of the total net pool of assets to be as shown below in **Table A**.

#### Disputed Liability to YTL

113    As regards the Matrimonial Home, I did not accept the Husband’s claim that his brother YTL had helped him pay $1,848.69 every month towards the mortgage of the Matrimonial home since September 2015. In support of his claim that his brother had lent him these monies, the Husband had adduced a loan agreement dated 1 September 2016 signed between him and YTL. There were questionable aspects surrounding the Husband’s claim of the purported loan.

114    First, the alleged loan agreement was signed in _September 2016_ (about 2 months after the divorce was filed by the Husband) and in respect of alleged loans from YTL which had commenced one year ago in _September 2015._ Secondly, the alleged loan agreement was also devoid of specific details. It did not set out the amounts that YTL had lent to the Husband since September 2015 and would be continuing to pay, and this would have been important bearing in mind that the payments had allegedly been paid by YTL in cash every month since September 2015. Thirdly, YTL did not file any affidavits adducing documentary evidence to substantiate that monthly cash sums of $1,848.69 had been withdrawn by him from his account(s) and handed to the Husband (down to the last 69 cents) to make his mortgage payments. Counsel for the Wife submitted that the Husband’s claim here was merely an attempt to ‘_harmonise_’ the Husband’s monthly mortgage payments with his fictitious account that he earned only $3,000 per month as a manager of SH Pub.

115    The burden was on the Husband to prove his claim on the existence of this liability owing to YTL in respect of the Matrimonial Home. All considered, I was not satisfied, on balance, that he had done so, and as such, the only liability that I accepted in respect of the Matrimonial Home was its outstanding housing loan as shown below in **Table A**.

117    In respect of the Matrimonial Home, I accepted the Husband’s evidence that he had contributed much more that the Wife towards the acquisition of the Matrimonial Home. I noted that after their first home, the Riverdale Property, was sold in 2012, the balance proceeds totaling about $227,031 had gone into the parties’ joint POSB bank account in April 2012. But, on about 3 May 2012, 2 sums were withdrawn from it: (a) a sum of $199,046 was withdrawn and paid into the Husband’s sole account, and (b) a sum of $20,000 was withdrawn and paid into the Wife’s sole account. The parties then dealt with these monies in their own respective accounts by making their payments towards the purchase of the Matrimonial Home. If there was an agreement to use the balance sale proceeds to pay for the purchase of the Matrimonial Home, these monies could just have been paid out direct from the parties’ joint account. There would not have been a need for these 2 specific sums to be paid out first to each party’s sole account. On the evidence before me, the sums of $41,175, $26,787 and $37,935 were paid out as contributions from the Husband’s sole account for the purchase of the Matrimonial Home, whilst the sum of $12,470 was contributed by the Wife from her sole account. In addition, the Husband had contributed $88,000 and the Wife had contributed $35,000 from their respective CPF monies to the down payment of the Matrimonial Home.

118    I accepted also that a further sum of $30,000 was contributed by the Husband towards the renovations for the Matrimonial Home. These renovations had occurred in the later part of 2015 and the Husband was able to produce invoices to support his claims here.

119    As for the assets that were held in the parties’ respective names, I accepted that a broad-brush approach should be applied in the absence of the parties’ historical contributions towards the acquisition of these assets. As such, I had therefore taken the value of the assets in the parties’ respective names as reflecting their respective direct financial contributions (see _TUV v TUW_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHCF 15</span> at \[33\]).

120    On the parties’ indirect contributions to the family, I noted that this was a marriage of 8 ½ years (to IJ) with 2 children. The evidence before me showed that both parties were involved in taking care of the Children, with the help of the maternal grandparents. As the Children were young, the Wife had contributed more to looking after them. There were clear periods from the time the Son was born in April 2010 and until the Daughter was born in January 2013 and, also after she left the Matrimonial Home in December 2015 to June 2016, when the Wife was not working and looking after the Children full-time. Of particular note was the period in or around 2012 where the Wife’s mother (who was helping the Wife earlier) was also diagnosed with cancer and needed her care at the time. During this difficult period, the Wife had to look after the Son and her mother, and she was also expecting the Daughter.

121    In her evidence, the Wife did not deny that her mother had assisted to look after the Children (and for a period, the Children were living with their maternal grandparents), but she was still very much involved in caring for the Children during her non-working hours. I accepted her evidence that even on days when she worked (which was about 3 - 4 days each week), she would go to her parents’ house to look after the Children and have dinner with them before she went to work, and sometimes, she would even stay at her parents’ place after work to spend more time with the Children. When parties moved into their Matrimonial Home (which was also located near her parents’ home), the Wife looked after the Children in their new home on her non-working days, but she would bring the Children to her parents’ home on her working days for her mother to help her take care of them. It should be noted that in 2015, the Children were only about 5 and 2 years old.

122    After December 2015, the arrangement between the parties was that the Wife would have care and control of the Children and the Husband would have access to them on Fridays and Saturdays but on condition that he returned them at the end of the day. Messages exchanged between the parties in April and May 2016 showed the Husband missing his access times with the Children as he was just too busy or tired.[^36] The messages also showed that the Wife was the one who was reminding the Husband about the Children’s schedules, homework and tests. [^37]As for the holiday cruise that the Husband took the Children on in June 2016, the Husband admitted that the cruise had in fact been planned and booked by the Wife for the family about a year back in 2015.

123    Clearly, the Husband had throughout the marriage, a taxing work schedule. At the start of their marriage, he was managing only SH Pub and IN Bar (having taken over these 2 businesses in mid- 2007). But, thereafter, he was also (by his own admission) a paid consultant in several other pub businesses during the marriage. These included XS Bar, W Bar, K Company, WH Entertainment and BC Pte Ltd. In addition, he also held interests in and / or was involved in the management of TPE and several other businesses during the marriage (these included SA LLP, Club W, D Inn and FT Bar as set out in **paragraph 107**).

124    Given the above, I found it unlikely and did not believe his claims that he was working just 3 to 4 days a week throughout the marriage and spending all his free hours looking after the Children and doing household chores as well. Indeed, in his 1VA, he had said that “**_when \[he\] was the owner of the business_**”, he had “**_spent most of \[his\] time at work_**_…_”.

125    In fact, in a message to the Wife on _3 June 2016_ (about one month before he filed for divorce), the Husband complained about having to pay so much maintenance for the Children “**_n they r not close to me_**?” In the Wife’s affidavits, she described how he was hardly involved in the care of the Children; he worked 6 to 7 days a week from 6pm to 3am, he would often return home at 4am and sleep until the afternoon (waking up for lunch) and sleeping more, and then leaving for work again at about 4pm for dinner, before opening the pub at 6pm. He hardly spent any time at home doing anything else other than getting his sleep or doing more work. He hardly did any of the household chores which were left for her to do.

126    All considered, I accepted that the Wife was juggling her work at SH Pub with her care of the Children and the home, and that as between the parties, she was the main caregiver for the Children with the help of her mother.

127    However, I noted the indirect financial contributions on the part of the Husband towards the family and the household. He had contributed towards the utilities and other outgoings of their homes during the marriage. He had also provided the Wife with a monthly maintenance of about $300 to $500 per month for her personal and household expenses from about 2011 to December 2015. Thereafter, as he had stopped providing monthly maintenance for the Children, the Wife had taken out an application for interim maintenance against him under section 113 of the Women’s Charter. At a court mediation on 28 December 2016, parties agreed that the Husband would (a) pay the Wife a monthly interim maintenance sum of $500 for the Children with effect from January 2017, and (b) pay also for the Children’s school fees, the Daughter’s insurance policy and half of the Children’s medical and dental costs. Subsequently, in July 2017, the monthly interim maintenance sum for the Children was ordered to be increased to $880 (see **paragraph 161**).

128    Having regard to all the particular facts of this case, I was therefore of the view that the Wife had contributed more in terms of indirect contributions to the family, and that on a broad brush basis, these indirect contributions were fairly represented by a ratio of 60:40 in the Wife’s favour.

129    With an equal weightage applied to both the direct and indirect contributions of the parties, the overall average ratio in percentage terms was therefore 58.5% for the Husband and 41.5% for the Wife.

130    The Wife had asked for an uplift of 20% to take into account the adverse inference to be drawn against the Husband for his failure to provide a full and frank disclosure of his income and assets for the ancillary matters.

131    As stated above, I drew an adverse inference against the Husband for not providing a full and frank disclosure of his income and assets. Considering the facts of the case and taking into account the pool of matrimonial assets and the sums added back to the pool, I decided that an uplift of 5% would be appropriate. As such, the final (adjusted) ratio was 53.5% for the Husband and 46.5% for the Wife. I was of the view that no further adjustments were necessary in this case, and that this ratio of 53.5 (Husband): 46.5 (Wife) (“**Final Ratio**”) represented a fair and equitable division of the pool of matrimonial assets between the parties.

132    At the hearing, the Husband informed that he no longer wanted to retain the Matrimonial Home. That being so, to implement the division, I applied the **Final Ratio of 53.5 (Husband): 46.5 (Wife)** to all the assets in the pool.

133    For the Matrimonial Home, I ordered that it was to be sold in the open market within 6 months from the date of my order. Parties were to have joint conduct of the sale and the net sale proceeds (after deducting the payments for the outstanding housing loan and the costs and expenses relating to the sale) were to be divided between the parties in the Final Ratio. Parties were to make the requisite CPF refunds from their respective shares of the net sale proceeds.

134    As for all the other assets in the pool (excluding the Matrimonial Home), they amounted to a total net value of $502,507.01. The Wife’s 46.5% of this sum of $502,507.01 amounted to $233,665.76. Counsel for both parties confirmed that the assets that were currently under the Wife’s sole name and possession amounted to an agreed value of $107,540.25[^38], and hence, the Wife was entitled to be paid a balance sum of $126,125.51 by the Husband (being $233,665.76 less $107,540.25). The final orders on the division of assets are summarized in **Appendix B**.

## Children Issues

135    The parties agreed that they would have joint custody of the Children. They also agreed to retain the current access arrangements for the Children during school holidays (including public holidays) and birthdays. The only issues for determination were:

> (a)     the care and control of the Children; and

> (b)     the terms of access during school term for the parent who was not granted care and control of the Children.

#### Care and control

136    Both parties had asked for sole care and control of the Children.

137    In connection with the issue of care and control of the Children, the Husband had applied, by way of SUM 1412/2019, for the appointment of a child psychiatrist but the application was dismissed on 16 August 2019. Instead, I appointed Ms Helen Chia-Thomas (“**Child Representative**” or “**CR**”) from Keystone Law Corporation as a child representative pursuant to Rule 30(1) of the Family Justice Rules (“**FJR**”). The role of a child representative appointed under Rule 30(1) of the FJR is set out in Rule 31 of the FJR. The Husband appealed against the dismissal of his application in SUM 1412/2019 but withdrew the appeal after grounds of decision were furnished.

138    Pursuant to her appointment as child representative, the CR had 4 meetings with the Children, two physical meetings held on 5 and 10 December 2019 and two zoom meetings held on 12 and 15 June 2020 (the CR had some difficulties in scheduling sessions following the first set of physical meetings and these difficulties were also compounded by the restrictions and conditions that were imposed in 2020 by the Government due to the Covid-19 pandemic).

139    For each set of meetings in December 2019 and June 2020, the CR met the Husband and the Children first, before she met the Wife and the Children. Following these meetings, the CR submitted her report in June 2020 (the “**CR Report**”) pursuant to Rule 32 of the FJR. She described her various sessions in these meetings. She had private sessions with the Children where she spoke with them separately and, also jointly. She also had sessions where she spoke with the parent and children together. There was also a session with the Husband’s partner of 4 years who said she had been helping him look after the Children at times (when his mother could not assist him).

140    In the CR Report, the CR recommended that the Wife should have care and control of the Children and that the Husband should have more access time with the Children.

141    The CR Report was severely criticised by the Husband. He submitted that the credibility of the CR Report was questionable as it was tainted with inaccurate facts, unverified information, subjective opinions of the CR and that the CR’s recommendation was substantially at odds with the wishes expressed by the Children to her.

142    As a preliminary point, it should be noted that the CR is not an expert upon which the Court will rely on for an opinion as to the issue of custody, care and control of the Children. While the Court will take into consideration the observations of the CR as set out in the CR Report, the issue of the care and control of the Children is a matter that will be decided by the Court after assessing all the evidence adduced before it, and having regard to the paramount consideration of the welfare and best interests of the Children.

143    As highlighted in the CR Report, the CR had observed during her meetings with the Children and their mother on 10 December 2019 and 15 June 2020 that the relationship between the Children and their mother was casual, natural and warm and they had a close bond. During these meetings, the Children did not make any comment to the CR in relation to their father.

144    On the other hand, at the first meeting of the CR with the Children and their father on 5 December 2019, the Children stated that they wanted to live with the father and that they did not want to see their mother ever again. When asked by the CR, the Children could not provide any reasons for their (alleged) desired living arrangements although the CR had observed the Children to be articulate. In fact, the Son “_did not reply_” and “_looked like he was going to breakdown at this juncture_”. As for Daughter, she stated that “_she does not know why and had no reasons_”. This expression of the Children made on 5 December 2019 was contradictory to the ease and comfort in which they had related to their mother on 10 December 2019 in the presence of the CR. It was also contradicted by the very off-chance encounter that the CR had with the Children at East Coast Park on a Saturday evening in January 2020 when they were out cycling with their mother. The Children had called out to the CR as they had seen her walking. She had chatted with the Children and had observed their happiness on that occasion.

145    Similarly, during the zoom meeting held between the CR and the Children on 12 June 2020, the Son stated that he would like to live with his father as he felt “_relaxed here_” and that his mother “_does not treat (him) well_”. At the same meeting, in a separate session, the Daughter stated that she wanted to live with both parents “50-50” but was observed by the CR to be disturbed when she said that. Later on, when the CR was having a separate session with the father, the Daughter suddenly interrupted that session and said abruptly that it was her mother who told her to say that she wanted to live with both parents ’50-50’. This again was contradictory and inconsistent with the ease of relationship and closeness between the Children and their mother as observed by the CR during the zoom meeting held _subsequently_ on 15 June 2020.

146    I noted the comments of the CR on the above meetings. Having read the CR Report, I found nothing in it to suggest that the observations of the CR during these meetings should not be relied on. There were some errors in the report which the CR clarified were typographical errors and did not affect in any way her recommendations and observations. The thrust of her observations was that the Children enjoyed a warmer and close relationship with their mother and that that ease, comfort and closeness with their mother “_contradicted in many ways_” their statements of not wanting to see their mother again.

147    I noted that the Husband was the main breadwinner of the family after the marriage in October 2008 and was entrepreneurial in starting, managing and or consulting on a number of pubs which would have required his commitment and time. As the Children came shortly in April 2010 and January 2013 and given the various periods that the Wife was not working and was looking after them full-time, the primary caregiver of the two Children was the Wife with the help of her mother especially. As mentioned earlier, when the Wife had stepped in to help the Husband with his pub business, it was because she was able to rely on her mother to help her look after the Children during her working days.

148    At the time of the hearing in 2020 on the Children issues (after the CR Report had been rendered), the Wife had been residing together with the Children in her parent’s home for about 4 plus years (since December 2015). The Children were then 7 years old and 10 years old.

149    Since leaving the Matrimonial Home, the Children have been looked after by the Wife with the help of her parents. During this period, the parties had their arrangements on the care and control and access of the Children, and those arrangements had worked reasonably well (except for two (2) instances described below).

150    In June 2016, with the Wife’s permission, the Husband had gone on a cruise with the Children. The agreement of the parties was for the Children to be returned to the Wife after the end of the cruise. The Husband reneged on his promise and held on to the Children. The Wife had to lodge a police report arising from this episode before the Daughter was returned to her care. Following the Husband’s conduct described above, the Wife applied for and obtained in August 2016, an order of court granting her interim care and control of the Children and the return of the Son. This interim care and control order was varied subsequently on 6 June 2017 in that the Wife’s care and control of the Children continued but the Husband was granted more access (“**June 2017 Order**”).

151    Then, in November 2017, the Husband refused to return the Son after the end of his access period and refused to inform the Wife of the Son’s whereabouts. The Husband had admitted the Son into a hospital. This episode was also in connection with the Husband’s complaint that the Wife’s brother had committed family violence on the Son. The Husband then applied for a personal protection order (“**PPO**”) for the Son against the Wife’s brother. The Husband’s PPO application for the Son was dismissed and the Husband was also unsuccessful in his appeal against the said dismissal.

152    Relying on this alleged episode of family violence, the Husband had also sought in SUM 3973/2017 to reverse the interim care and control order in the June 2017 Order, to seek care and control of the Son. The Husband had previously suggested to the Wife on splitting care and control of the Children, the Son to him and the Daughter to the Wife. This proposal was roundly rejected by the Wife as she felt it was not good to split the siblings as they were young and would be able to support each other.

153    SUM 3973/2017 was dismissed in December 2017, but a social welfare report was ordered by the Court given the contested care and control issues between the parties. The Children were then only 5 and 8 years old. In brief, the independent report (rendered in April 2018) had observed that the Children were well-cared for, happy and healthy children, with warm and loving relationships with each parent notwithstanding their parents’ marital conflicts and divorce. The Children were developing well socially and emotionally. School reports showed that they were also doing well in school, especially the Son.

154    Based on the evidence filed, the Wife was very much an involved and hands-on parent. I noted that while she was a flight attendant with a regional airline, her present work flight schedule was (as submitted by counsel) not unlike an average person’s working hours as she did turnaround flights within the day. Her mother took care of the Children during the day while she worked, and she would care for the Children during her non-working hours. Under the existing care arrangements, the Children have developed well and very importantly, they have been able to maintain their loving relationships with their father and both parents have been involved in the Children’s lives.

155    On the other hand, due to the nature of the Husband’s work in the pub businesses and the hours he kept, I was concerned that he would be away in the evenings and at night when the Children were asleep (if the Children were to reside mainly with him as he wanted) and he would have to leave them in the care of his mother (who was in her 70s), or rely on his partner to help him take care of them. Based on the many inconsistencies and contradictions in his evidence, I did not believe that he was just a mere employee at SH Pub with extremely flexible hours for his Children. I noted the examples cited in recent times where the Husband did not even attend the Son’s important events such as his Edusave Award Ceremonies in 2018 and 2019 and the School Parent- Teacher Connection in 2019. This was notwithstanding the Wife informing him of the events prior to the same. I also had concerns about the Husband’s attempts to undermine the Wife’s relationship with the Children.

156    On balance, taking into consideration all the circumstances of this case, the stability and continuity afforded by the status quo arrangements, the social welfare report and the CR Report, I decided that it was in the welfare and best interests of the Children that the Wife should continue to have sole care and control of the Children. However, I ordered that the Husband was to have more access time with the Children with effect from 1 October 2020.

#### Access

157    As mentioned earlier, the parties agreed that current access arrangements of the Children during school holidays (including public holidays) and birthdays as per the June 2017 Order could continue to apply. However, the Husband submitted that he should be granted additional access time during the school term if he failed to obtain sole care and control of the Children. He asked that he be granted access to the Children:

> (a)     after school, on Friday to Monday morning when he would fetch them to school; and

> (b)     after school, on Wednesday to Thursday morning when he would fetch them to school.

158    The Wife submitted that the current access time granted to the Husband during school term was more than sufficient and that there was no necessity to grant the Husband more time with the Children. She also took issue with the Husband’s alleged tendency to parent unilaterally and his coaching and manipulation of the Children as well as the unsuccessful PPO application filed by him.

159    I noted that presently, the Husband did not have any weekday overnight access and for the weekend overnight access, it was only on Friday after school up to 6 pm on Saturday.

160    As the Children were now much older at 7 years old and 10 years old and having regard to the observations and recommendations of the CR, I was inclined to grant the Husband additional access time in a calibrated manner. As such, I granted the Husband weekday overnight access to the Children on Wednesday, after school to Thursday morning when he will send them to school. As for weekend access, I also extended the period of his overnight access from Friday after school to 12 noon on Sunday (instead of 6pm on Saturday). The extended period was to apply on alternate weeks. During the other weeks, the Husband was to have access to both Children from Friday after school until Saturday 6pm as per the current arrangement.

#### Maintenance for the Children

161    Pursuant to paragraph 3(a) of the Order of Court dated 3 July 2017 (the “**Interim Maintenance Order**”), the Husband was ordered to pay interim maintenance for the Children with effect from 5 January 2017 as follows:

> (a)     $880 per month for the Children ($480 for the Son, $400 for the Daughter);

> (b)     the school fees for the Children;

> (c)     insurance premiums for the Daughter’s insurance policy, and

> (d)     50% of the medical and dental costs of the Children.

162    Based on the Wife’s updated table of the Children’s expenses, and without factoring in the insurance components, school fees and the medical and dental expenses of the Children, the Wife had estimated that the Children’s total monthly expenses were presently about $2,006 ($1,186 for the Son and $820 for the Daughter). In his submissions, the Husband stated that these total monthly expenses were less, at about $1,715. His position was that parties should bear these monthly expenses and the school fees _equally_ (a variation of the position under the Interim Maintenance Order).

163    I was mindful that in determining the issue of the Children’s maintenance, I had to have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the circumstances listed in section 69(4) of the Women’s Charter. Among these, 2 factors were of especial relevance: (a) the financial needs of the Children, and (b) the financial abilities of the parties.

164    Having reviewed the Wife’s table of expenses, I found that some of the amounts claimed by the Wife were too high and had to be trimmed, having regard to the ages of the Children and the fact that they were cared for at home. One such example was the aggregate sum of $640.68 per month per child that the Wife had claimed in respect of their food, milk, bread, groceries including eating out. At the end, the Children’s reasonable monthly expenses were determined to be in the region of _about $1,800_ per month ($1,050 for the Son, and $756 for the Daughter) as shown below. These amounts were inclusive of the Children’s reasonable daily needs, and the monthly insurance premiums and the enrichment classes (as claimed) but did _not_ include their school fees and medical and dental expenses which were dealt with separately.

165    The Husband submitted that as there was a negligible difference between his monthly salary of $3,000 and his Wife’s at $2,800, parties should share the monthly expenses and the school fees of the Children equally. As for the existing insurance policies, he had proposed that he would pay for the Daughter’s insurance premiums (at $66 per month) and the Wife could be responsible for the Son’s insurance premiums (at $242.17 per month).

166    As mentioned earlier, I did not accept the Husband’s evidence that he was presently earning only $3,000 per month, and that his only source of income was as an employee of SH Pub. The evidence presented by the Husband was riddled with internal inconsistencies and contradictions (see **paragraphs 83 - 111**).

167    Secondly, during the marriage, the Husband was earning additional income from other sources even when he was running SH Pub and IN Bar. Evidence filed showed that he had interests in several other businesses, and he was clearly also receiving income as a paid consultant for other pub businesses (see **paragraphs 106 - 107**).

168    Thirdly, as mentioned earlier at **paragraph 108**, the Husband’s own bank statements showed that he was able to save $3,000 per month through the POSB Monthly Save as You Earn Scheme between April 2012 to March 2016. That he was able to save this amount every month and yet have alleged monthly expenses of about $5,650 per month showed that he could not have earned only about $1,000 to $5,000 per month as sole proprietor of SH Pub (as he had claimed) during the course of the marriage. In addition, the total amount allegedly repaid by him to Liew and NZS in 2014 and 2015 would also suggest that his earnings from SH Pub would be in excess of $5,000 per month (see **paragraph 90** above). The Husband had claimed that his monthly expenses amounted to about $5,650 based on the following:

> (a)     that his personal expenses and maintenance for the Children amounted to $3,844.47[^39];

> (b)     that he gave his mother a monthly allowance of $300[^40]; and

> (c)     that he also gave the Wife monthly payments of $1,000 from August 2009 to June 2016, and $500 from 2011 to May/June 2016.[^41]

In respect of his claims in sub-paragraph (a), the Husband had stated that his monthly cash instalment payment for the mortgage of the Matrimonial Home was only $1,000 (as he had claimed that his brother paid the balance of about $1,898 for him). On the basis that the Husband was footing the whole of the monthly mortgage payments himself, his alleged monthly expenses would then be about $7,500. In the circumstances, I used the aggregate of the Husband’s alleged monthly expenses and his monthly savings as a gauge of his earning capacity in determining the proportion of his contributions to the monthly maintenance of the Children.

169    Given the above and the undisputed fact that the Wife was earning only about $2,400 per month in comparison, I was of the view that it was reasonable that the Husband be responsible for _about 80%_ of the Children’s total monthly expenses as well as their school fees. As such, I held that the Husband was to pay a monthly sum of $1,440 as his contribution towards the maintenance of the Children (being $840 for the Son, and $600 for the Daughter) with effect from the last day of September 2020. As for medical and dental expenses, a consent order was recorded that parties were to bear these expenses for the Children equally. As the insurance premiums were already included in the total monthly expenses (as computed above), I made it clear in my order that the Wife would now be responsible for the payment of the Children’s policies.

#### Maintenance Arrears

170    Under the Interim Maintenance Order, the parties were to share the medical and dental expenses of the Children equally. I accepted that the Husband had incurred medical expenses for the Children which should be shared equally by the Wife as per the terms of the Interim Maintenance Order. Based on the evidence, the Wife’s half share of these medical expenses that were incurred by the Husband amounted to $3,188.30. With this sum deducted from the arrears claimed by the Wife, counsel for both parties confirmed that the Husband was still owing maintenance arrears of $574 to the Wife. As such, I ordered the Husband to pay the Wife these arrears of $574.

## Maintenance for the Wife

171    As mentioned above, the Wife was a working mother during the marriage. Since June 2016, she had also been working with a regional airline, and was still in its employ at the hearing of the ancillaries before me. The Wife was young and able, in her early thirties.

172    Taking into consideration the above and the division ordered where she was entitled to 45.6% of the total net pool of matrimonial assets, I did not grant the Wife’s application for nominal maintenance of $1 per month.

## Conclusion

173    At the conclusion of the hearing, after hearing the parties on the issue of costs, I ordered the Husband to pay the Wife costs of these ancillary proceedings fixed at $2,000 all-in. This was a reasonable award of costs, given that there had been delays at the Husband’s end in filing his second ancillary matters affidavit. It was to have been filed in early January 2019. Between January 2019 to March 2019, repeated extensions of time and final deadlines granted were breached by the Husband, necessitating several attendances at case conferences by the Wife’s counsel before the Husband finally filed his second ancillary matters affidavit on 1 April 2019.

## Appendix B

In summary, the final orders made on 30 September 2020 (“**Order**”) on the division of assets are as follows:

> In the event that there are insufficient monies after his CPF refunds to pay the Wife the sum of $126,125.51 in full, the Wife shall be entitled to the shortfall amount (“**$X**”) from the monies in the Husband’s CPF (OA) account and the CPF Board shall transfer $X from the Husband’s CPF (OA) account to the Wife’s CPF (OA) account.

> (d)     Save as set out above, each party shall retain all other assets in his/her sole name.
