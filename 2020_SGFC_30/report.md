Family Law – Ancillaries – Matrimonial Assets – Custody - Maintenance

16 March 2020

### District Judge Lo Wai Ping:

## Background

1       The parties first knew each other as pen pals before their marriage in April 1999. The Defendant-wife (“**Wife**”), then 21 years old, was from Ukraine and the Plaintiff-husband (“**Husband**”), then 27 years old, was a Singapore citizen.

2       After being married for about 19 years, the Husband commenced divorce proceedings in February 2018. By that time, the parties had lived apart for almost 5 years (since May 2013). Interim judgment for the divorce of the parties was granted on an uncontested basis on 14 June 2018 (“**Interim Judgment**”). Both parties had debilitating health conditions at the time. The Husband had been suffering from schizophrenia since 2009 and the Wife was blind in one eye and had severe visual impairment in the other eye, both due to congenital glaucoma. The Husband also suffered from cervical myelopathy which resulted in him having a bent posture.

3       The parties have two sons who will turn 19 and 13 this year (the “**Children**”) and their main matrimonial asset is a 3-room HDB flat in Jurong (“**Matrimonial Home**”). At the time of the Interim Judgment, the Husband worked for his elder sister (“**Elder Sister**”) at her school for children with special needs. She had given him a job as an assistant teacher in her school but had assigned him mainly to do mundane tasks in the office due to his condition. As for the Wife, in 2018, she worked as a part-time crew member at a fast food outlet and she also received monthly financial assistance from the Government’s social welfare services and other philanthropic organisations.

## Orders appealed against

4       The ancillaries first came before me for hearing in August 2019. The parties were represented by legal counsel. I dealt with the issues concerning the Children first and made the following orders on 12 September 2019. I granted the Wife sole custody, care and control of the Children. As for access to the Children, I made orders that the Husband was to start with 8 sessions of supervised access to the Children under the Supervised Visitation (SV) programme conducted by the Divorce Support Specialist Agencies (“**DSSA**”). The sessions were to take place once a week and each session was to be for 2 hours. A report was to be furnished to the Court upon completion of the 8 sessions and there would thereafter be a review of the terms of access by the Court. In addition, I also made orders that the parties and the Children were to attend counselling at DSSA concurrently.

5       On 24 October 2019, pursuant to counsel’s request, I had (together with a counsellor from the Family Court’s Counselling and Psychological Services unit) also explained the above orders relating to the supervised access to the parties and Children themselves.

6       I made the following orders on the rest of the ancillary matters on 14 November 2019 (“**AM Order**”):

> Division of matrimonial assets

> (a)    The pool of matrimonial assets of the parties shall be divided in the ratio of 45 (Wife): 55 (Husband) to be carried out as follows:

>> (i)    The Matrimonial Home shall be sold in the open market within 9 months of the AM Order and the sale proceeds shall be used as follows:

>>> (aa)   full payment of outstanding housing loan;

>>> (bb)   payment of all cost and expenses of the sale; and thereafter,

>>> (cc)   the balance of the sale proceeds shall be divided in the proportion of 45 (Wife): 55 (Husband)

>> and the parties shall from their respective shares of the balance proceeds pay into their CPF accounts the requisite refunds in accordance with the applicable CPF laws.

>> (ii)   The parties shall have joint conduct of the sale of the Matrimonial Home.

>> (iii)   Until the completion of the sale of the Matrimonial Home within the stipulated period set out above in sub-paragraph (i), the Wife shall continue to bear the utilities and conservancy charges and other outgoings of the Matrimonial Home whilst the Husband shall continue to pay for the mortgage payments.

>> (iv)   In addition, the Wife shall be entitled to $15,000 of the Husband’s CPF monies pursuant to Section 112 of the Woman’s Charter (“Ordered Amount”).

>> (v)    After the making of refunds into the Husband’s CPF accounts of the required CPF monies from his sale proceeds of the Matrimonial Home, the CPF Board shall transfer the Ordered Amount from the monies standing to the credit of the Husband’s Ordinary Account to the Wife’s Ordinary Account.

>> (vi)   The CPF Board shall only transfer the Ordered Amount after the CPF Board has been informed of the sale of the Matrimonial Home and refunds have been credited in the CPF accounts of the Husband.

> (b)    Save as set out above, each party shall retain all other assets held in his or her own name.

> (c)    This order is made subject to the CPF Act and the subsidiary legislation made thereunder. The CPF Board shall give effect to the terms of this order in accordance with the provisions of CPF Act and the subsidiary legislation made thereunder.

> (d)    The Registrar or Deputy Registrar of the Family Justice Courts under section 31 of the Family Justice Act 2014 is empowered to execute, sign or indorse all necessary documents relating to the matters contained in this order on behalf of either party should either party fail to do so within seven days of written request being made to the party.

> (e)    The parties including the CPF Board shall be at liberty to apply for further directions and orders generally.

> Maintenance for the Wife and the Children

> (f)    The Husband will pay the Wife nominal maintenance of $1.00 per month.

> (g)    The Husband shall continue to contribute a total sum of $1,200 per month for the maintenance of the Children (as before) on 15th day of each month into the Wife’s designated bank account.

7       Both parties have appealed against the whole of my decision on the ancillaries.

## Background information

8       I will first set out the relevant background information.

9       After their marriage in 1999, the parties stayed in a 3-room HDB flat in Tanjong Pagar that belonged to the Husband’s mother (the “**Mother’s Flat**”). The parties lived in the Mother’s Flat together with the Husband’s mother and the Husband’s second sister (who is mentally challenged) and the Elder Sister’s three children. Subsequently, a helper was engaged by the Elder Sister to assist her mother to look after her three children there.

10     Although the Wife was trained as a nurse in Ukraine, her qualifications were not recognised here. But, in 1999, she found work as an assistant teacher at a school for physically disabled children and worked there for one year after marriage. She stopped work when she became pregnant. In 2000, she obtained her Singapore permanent residency status and in 2001, she gave birth to their first son. As finances were tight for them after their first son was born (with the Husband also having to pay for his mother’s household bills for the extended family living in her flat), the Wife went back to work shortly after in 2002. While the parties were working, the Husband’s mother helped to look after their son.

11     In 2004, the parties moved into their own flat (the Matrimonial Home) which they had purchased in their joint names. At the time of the ancillary matters hearing (“**AM Hearing**”) before me, the Wife and the Children were still staying in the Matrimonial Home.

12     In 2007, the Wife gave birth to their second son. In the same year, the Husband lost his job and the family was financially stressed. The Wife had also stopped work to look after their new baby and the older son. The Husband worked as a private tutor for a few months before the Elder Sister gave the Husband a job as an assistant teacher in her school for children with special needs (“**School**”). The Elder Sister ran this School as its principal. As at the AM Hearing, the Husband was still working for the Elder Sister at the same school. However, Husband’s employment at the School was not continuous and was also interrupted with periods of absence when he was sick.

13     In 2009, the Husband was first diagnosed to suffer from schizophrenia and he started medical treatment. The Children were then about 8 and 2 years old. Starting from this period and until the Husband left the Matrimonial Home in May 2013 (the Wife having locked him out of the Matrimonial Home), there were a few police reports lodged by the Wife against the Husband. The Wife also obtained a personal protection order against the Husband in September 2013. Based on the Wife’s evidence, the Husband’s behaviour had suddenly changed in 2009. He acted irrationally and was delusional, and at times, he even assaulted her and there were occasions when he had (without reason) caused hurt to the Children. In an incident in October 2012, due to his condition, he had even threatened to kill all 3 of them.

14     On 11 May 2013, the Wife locked the Husband out of the Matrimonial Home. Based on her police report of 11 May 2013, she had locked him out because of his threats to kill her. It would appear from her report that his schizophrenia condition was not under control at the time. Since then, the Husband has been staying at his Mother’s Flat with his mother and his second sister, whilst the Wife and the Children continued to stay in the Matrimonial Home.

15     Whilst the Husband was under treatment for his schizophrenia since 2009, there was no medical evidence adduced before me as to the seriousness of the Husband’s mental health during the period from 2009 to 2013 and his ability to function and work effectively. But, I noted the Wife’s various police reports made during this period and her complaints filed with the family court in 2013 when she applied for her personal protection order. In her complaints, she stated that even though the Husband was under psychiatric treatment for some time, he started to show irrational and violent behaviour to her and the Children in October 2012.

16     In December 2015, the Husband was arrested for causing hurt to a police officer. He was sent to the Institute of Mental Health (“**IMH**”) for observations. It should be noted that the Husband’s illness was sufficiently serious for him to be remanded in IMH for about 3 months from December 2015 to April 2016 for treatment before his discharge. After his discharge from IMH, the Husband was required to continue with out-patient treatment at IMH. In October 2016, the Husband was served with a Mandatory Treatment Order (“**MTO**”) to seek treatment for his schizophrenia for a period of one and a half years from October 2016 to March 2018.

17     In March 2017, the Husband suffered a relapse and was brought to the emergency department of a hospital before he was sent to and remanded at IMH. The Husband had to undergo an 8-week rehabilitation program at the IMH.

18     Based on his latest IMH report dated 30 August 2018 (“**IMH Medical Report**”), the Husband was last seen by the consultant at IMH in August 2018 and the Husband was found to have been in remission from his schizophrenia for more than a year. It would appear from the IMH Medical Report that the Husband’s condition could be controlled so long as he was conscientious in taking the medication prescribed for him.

19     I now set out below the grounds of my decision.

## Decision

#### Custody care and control of the Children

20     At the time of the AM Hearing in 2019, the Children were about 18 and 12 years old and residing with the Wife in the Matrimonial Home. There was no dispute that the Children would continue to reside with the Wife and be under her care and control. She had been their primary caregiver since young and their sole caregiver since 2013. I had no doubt that they were well-loved and well-cared for by her all these years.

21     As for access to the Children, counsel for the Husband informed at the hearing that the Husband was agreeable to having supervised access to the Children. He had not had access to the Children since he was locked out from the Matrimonial Home in May 2013 by the Wife. Although he had attempted to visit the Children thereafter, he was prevented by the Wife’s actions from doing so. However, he wanted to have joint custody of the Children with the Wife. He expressed in his affidavits that he loved and missed the Children very much. The Wife, on the other hand, submitted that she should be given sole custody of the Children given the instability of the Husband’s schizophrenia condition and his history of violence towards her and the Children. As for access, whilst she did not object to the Husband having supervised access to the Children, she requested that the access arrangements be made subject to the wishes of the Children given their ages.

22     Having regard to the parties’ positions above, and in the welfare of the Children, the Wife was granted care and control of the Children, and an interim order for supervised access was granted on the terms as set out in paragraph 4 above. As stated, there would be a Court review of the access terms after the completion of the 8 ordered sessions and upon receipt of the DSSA report.

23     On the concept of what residual custody (that is, custody without care and control) of children meant for divorcing parents, this was explained by the Court of Appeal in the case of _CX v CY_ \[2005\] 3 SLR(R) 390 (“**_CX v CY_**”) at \[31\] and \[35\] as follows:

> 31    … where parties are splitting up, custody as a general concept is divided into two smaller packages, ie, ‘care and control’ and residual ‘custody’. …\[R\]esidual ‘custody’ is the package of residual rights that remains after the grant of a care and control order that dictates which parent shall be the daily caregiver of the child and with whom the child shall live. To put it simplistically, ‘care and control’ concerns day-to-day decision making, while residual ‘custody’ concerns the long-term decision-making for the welfare of the child.

> 35    … it is an almost impossible task for us to lay down an exhaustive list of matters which will fall under the concept of residual custody. The line is not always clear as to what matters would be considered the important and longer-term decisions concerning the upbringing and welfare of a child. It suffices to say that decisions pertaining to religion, education and major healthcare issues would fall into such a category.

24     Custody without care and control therefore concerned the right to make decisions over the major aspects of a child’s life such as the child’s religion, education and major healthcare issues. And in this regard, whilst the Court of Appeal in _CX v CY_ had also stated that granting joint custody orders should be the norm as joint parenting was in the welfare of children, it had also stated the following at \[38\] on the exceptional circumstances where sole custody orders may be warranted:

> …The question we have to answer will always be what is best for the child in the future. We agree with Assoc Prof Debbie Ong that the exceptional circumstances where sole custody orders are made may be where one parent physically, sexually, or emotionally abuses the child …, or where the relationship of the parties is such that co-operation is impossible even after the avenues of mediation and counselling have been explored, and the lack of co-operation is harmful to the child.

25     Based on the evidence before me, I was of the view that there were exceptional circumstances in this case for granting the Wife sole custody of the Children.

26     As mentioned earlier, in 2009, when he was first diagnosed with schizophrenia and started treatment, the Children were very young, just 8 and 2 years of age. Whilst the Husband denied that he had inflicted violence on the Wife and Children during the period between 2009 and 2013, the police reports and the complaints filed at the Family Court and other documents adduced by the Wife showed the following:

> (a)     On 3 November 2009, the Wife had obtained an expedited protection order against the Husband for family violence. The Husband breached the expedited protection order and was issued a warning by the police in May 2010.

> (b)     In October 2012, the Wife filed a police report of another incident of violence by the Husband against her in the presence of the Children. On this occasion, the Husband had also said caused hurt to the Children and (notwithstanding the presence of his own mother who had rushed to the scene to help the family) he had continued with his aggressive behaviour and even made threats to kill the family.

> (c)     In May 2013, the Wife reported yet another incident of the Husband threatening to kill her. This was the occasion when he had refused to take his medication for his condition and the Wife had locked him out of the home as a result of his threat and called the police for help.

> (d)     On 10 September 2013, pursuant to the Wife’s complaints filed at the Family Court in 2013, a personal protection order was granted against the Husband for her protection.

27     Based on the Husband’s own IMH Report, during the period between 2013 and 2017, he had suffered a few relapses. For his relapse in December 2015 (which had started in September 2015 and resulted in him causing hurt to a police officer), his condition was sufficiently serious to warrant his remand in IMH for 3 months to receive in-patient treatment. Even after his discharge from IMH, the Husband was required to continue with out-patient treatment at IMH.

28     Subsequently, the Husband was served with an 18-month MTO requiring him to continue with his treatment at the IMH. The length of the MTO was indicative of the severity of his condition then.

29     Notwithstanding the MTO, the Husband had to be admitted to the emergency department of a public hospital in March 2017 due to a relapse again. He then had to undergo an 8-week rehabilitation program at IMH.

30     All the above episodes relating to the treatment required by the Husband for his schizophrenia clearly showed that he was not in a good state of health after 2013. It would appear that whilst he was staying with his mother, he had not been compliant with taking his medication. Based on the evidence, he was undergoing treatment at the IMH, both in-patient and out-patient for more than 2 years, in 2016 and 2017. In fact, in August 2018, the Husband was still having follow-up out-patient treatment at the IMH.

31     The nature and severity of his schizophrenia set out above was very likely one reason for his lack of contact with the Children after May 2013. Unfortunately, this (coupled also with the Wife’s actions in refusing to allow him to visit the Children) resulted in him not having a proper relationship with the Children for at least 6 years.

32     Whilst the IMH Report indicated that the Husband was “presently not a danger to others including children” as his condition was now in remission, the consultant at IMH had nevertheless cautioned that the Husband should continue taking his anti-psychotic medication and injections, and that any interactions between the Husband and the Children might best be supervised at the outset.

33     Considering the Husband’s past history with the Wife and her continued fears of him hurting the Children particularly, and given the lack of any meaningful interaction between the parties since 2013, it was uncertain whether any discussion or interaction between parties on matters pertaining to major issues concerning the Children (which would be necessary if the Husband was granted joint custody) could even take place and more importantly, whether these interactions might also result in stressful situations for the Husband.

34     I also noted the emphasis placed by the IMH consultant in requiring the Husband to continue with his prescribed medication and injections in order to ensure that his condition was controlled. In the event of a relapse of his schizophrenia condition, it would be difficult for the Wife and the Children to deal with the Husband, even in relation to his right of supervised access. Therefore, considering all the circumstances of the case, I was of the view that it would be in the welfare of the Children that the Wife be granted sole custody of them.

## Division of matrimonial assets

35     It was accepted in this case that the date of Interim Judgment (14 June 2018) was the operative date for determining whether an asset fell within the pool of matrimonial assets for division. As for the valuation of the matrimonial assets in the pool, these were based in my decision on the values that were agreed by both counsel during the AM Hearing.

#### Agreed Pool of Matrimonial Assets

36     The agreed pool of matrimonial assets for division as at Interim Judgment comprised the Matrimonial Home and the CPF and bank accounts of the parties. The agreed values for the CPF and bank accounts of the parties were as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="54.7%"> <col width="21.7%"> <col width="23.6%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Table A</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Husband ($)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Wife ($)</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Matrimonial Assets</b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>(other than Matrimonial Home)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">CPF</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">65,881.92</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">26,080.87</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Bank account</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">4.71</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">539.21</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sub-total</b></p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>65,886.63</b></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>26,620.08</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

37     As for the Matrimonial Home purchased in 2004, it was registered in the joint names of the parties. At the hearing in August 2019, counsel for both parties agreed to $270,000 as the current market value of the Matrimonial Home and $25,000 as the outstanding housing loan for the Matrimonial Home. Therefore, the net value of the Matrimonial Home was taken to be $245,000.

38     Based on the agreed values stated above, the total net pool of matrimonial assets for division was $337,506.71 (being $245,000 + $65,886.63 + $26,620.08).

##### Structured approach in ANJ v ANK

39     For the division of the pool of matrimonial assets, I applied the structured approach in _ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span> (“**ANJ Approach**”). Save for 2 periods (total of about 7 years), it was the Wife’s evidence that she had worked throughout the marriage and at the time of Interim Judgment, she was still working as a part-time crew member at a fast food outlet although her hours of work had become shorter due to the worsening eyesight in her left eye. As for the Husband, he had also worked throughout the marriage, save for those periods when he suffered relapses in his schizophrenia and required treatment. On the evidence before me, due to his condition, he had worked mainly for his Elder Sister at her School.

40     The ANJ Approach has been summarised by the High Court in _TIT v TIU_ (2016) 3 SLR 1137 at \[21\] as follows:

> (a)     express as a ratio the parties’ direct contributions relative to each other, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets;

> (b)     express as a second ratio the parties’ indirect contributions relative to each other, having regard to both indirect financial and non-financial contributions; and

> (c)     derive the parties’ overall contributions to each other by taking an average of the two ratios above (the derived ratio shall be referred to as “the average ratio”), keeping in mind that, depending on the circumstances of each case, the direct and indirect contributions may not be accorded equal weight and one of the two ratios may be accorded more significance than the other. Adjustments could also be made in respect of other relevant factors under s 112 or s 114(1) of the Women’s Charter…

41     It should be noted that the ANJ approach was essentially an approach to guide the court’s exercise of its powers of matrimonial division to achieve a just and equitable result under s 112 (1) of the Women’s Charter (“**the Charter**”). It was not to be applied in a rigid mathematical manner and the broad brush approach was in no way replaced by it (see _ANJ v ANK_ (supra) at \[23\] to \[25\]).

#### Direct contributions

42     I have set out in Table B the parties’ respective direct financial contributions to the agreed pool of matrimonial assets. Based on these agreed figures in Table B, I found the ratio of their direct contributions to be 81:19 in favour of the Husband.

43     On the issue of direct contributions, the Wife claimed that she had contributed a sum of US$35,000 (equivalent to about $59,000) towards the acquisition and improvement of the Matrimonial Home. According to the Wife, her mother in Ukraine had gifted her a sum of US$35,000 in 2004 and she had used this sum at the time for renovations as well as for the acquisition of furniture and fittings for the Matrimonial Home. Her evidence on this was disputed by the Husband. The Wife was not able to produce any supporting documentary evidence to substantiate her claim. I did not accept her bare assertion that she had contributed a sum of about $59,000 in 2004 towards the acquisition or improvement of the Matrimonial Home.

#### Indirect Contributions

44     For indirect contributions, based on the evidence of the parties, there were essentially 2 periods in this marriage of about 19 years (to Interim Judgment in June 2018):

> (a)     the first period was from the marriage in April 1999 to May 2013 (when the Husband was locked out of the Matrimonial Home and lived apart thereafter from the family) - this was about 14 years.

> (b)     the second period was from about May 2013 to Interim Judgment in June 2018 – this was about 5 years.

45     For the first 14 years of the marriage, the Wife worked full-time for about half that period and contributed to the family’s expenses. As for the other half of the said period, Wife spent her time looking after the home and the Children. I also took into account that from the time of their marriage to 2004 (the first 5 years), the parties and their first son were actually living in the Mother’s Flat together with the Husband’s extended family. But, from 2004, the parties had their own home and she was the main caregiver of the Children during the time that she did not work. During the earlier part, before her second son was born and when both parties were working, the Husband’s mother had helped to look after their elder son. As for the Husband, he was the main provider during this period and he also did his part in looking after the Children until the onset of his schizophrenia condition in 2009. There was evidence that thereafter, whilst he was under psychiatric treatment, he was still working to provide for the family. It was not disputed that he had started working for his Elder Sister at the School sometime after 2007 and he was still working there in 2012, 2013 and 2014 (based on his CPF records). Hence, for a period of about 12 years or so from 1999, there was evidence before me that the Husband did his part both financially and at home with the Children. In her complaint affirmed in the Family Court, the Wife acknowledged that her second son had adored his father in 2012. It was unfortunate that his mental illness created problems and resulted in his erratic and at times violent and delusional behaviour towards his family and this eventually led to parties living apart permanently from May 2013.

46     In the second period of about 5 years from May 2013 to June 2018, the Wife took up part-time work to supplement the family income but she also started receiving financial assistance from the Government’s social welfare services and other philanthropic organisations. At the same time, the Husband also provided maintenance for the Children (at $1,200 per month) since September 2013 and for the Wife (at $250 per month) since June 2015. These monthly sums were paid pursuant to maintenance orders obtained by the Wife in 2013 and 2015. At the AM Hearing, it was not disputed that there were no maintenance arrears owing by the Husband under these maintenance orders. Hence, although the Wife was on her own in looking after the Children since May 2013, the Husband had continued to provide financially for the Wife’s and the Children’s accommodation as well as for their needs and expenses through his housing loan payments and the ordered maintenance payments. And, these payments were still continuing at the time of the AM Hearing. I have therefore taken all these indirect contributions in the first period and second period of both parties into consideration.

47     Whilst the Wife had single-handedly looked after the Children during the last 5 years since May 2013 until Interim Judgment, the Husband had by staying away from the Wife and Children also not encumbered them with the burden of his unstable condition during this period. This was not a case of a husband who had simply abandoned his family. I accepted the Husband’s evidence that he had attempted to visit the Children after May 2013, but was prevented by the Wife from doing so and he did not persist then as he did not want the situation to adversely affect the Children.

48     On the facts of this case, on an overall basis, I found that the Wife had made more significant indirect contributions to the family. I had also considered the additional difficulties she had to bear when working and looking after the Children as a visually handicapped person. All considered and on a broad brush approach, I was of the view that it was fair to ascribe a ratio of 35 (Husband): 65 (Wife) to the parties’ indirect contributions to the well-being of the family during the whole period, from 1999 to 2018.

#### Final Ratio

49     Taking both the direct and indirect contributions ratios as determined above, the overall average ratio (on an equal weightage) worked out to be 58 (Husband): 42 (Wife).

50     I adjusted the above average ratio further to 55 (Husband): 45 (Wife) with adverse inferences drawn against the Husband for the following reasons.

> (a)     I noted that, based on her affidavit filed in June 2018, the Elder Sister’s evidence was that she was only paying the Husband currently 2 amounts, a salary of $800 per month (take-home of about $640 per month) and a sum of $1,450 so that he could fulfil his maintenance obligations as ordered by the Court. Taking her evidence of these payment to her brother, it would mean she was providing him about $2,089 each month. The Husband also provided evidence of payslips issued by the School and an employment contract with the School to prove that he had started working there again with effect from January 2018 at a salary of $800 per month.

> (b)     However, based on the bank statements provided by the Husband for the months from November 2017 to December 2018, which might not be complete months, the deposits made into the Husband’s bank accounts were as follows:

> For the period examined (2018), the average monthly deposits made into the Husband’s bank account were about $3,067. This was very much higher than the Husband’s take home pay (after CPF deductions) of about $640 per month. And, whilst the Elder Sister had explained that she was responsible in helping the Husband pay for the maintenance sum due to the Wife and the Children of $1,450 per month as mentioned above, this still could not explain the monthly deposits received by the Husband. It was noted that there were several single deposits of $2,800 into the Husband’s account as shown in the above Table. These were not explained by the Elder Sister. If the Elder Sister had made such payments and other payments each month into his bank account, she could have explained all these deposits in her affidavit. She did not. In fact, it was her evidence that she was “_already having financial strains and family problems paying this heavy sum of $1,450_” as she had herself 3 school-going children and her expenses were already high with supporting them with her eldest pursuing tertiary education soon. There was also no documentary evidence adduced by the Husband subsequently to substantiate his bare assertions that all the deposits seen in his account were made by his Elder Sister. Therefore, on an analysis of the Husband’s bank statements, there were gaps in his explanation on his sources of funds.

51     Having considered all the facts of this case, and on broad brush basis, the final adjusted ratio of 45 (Wife): 55 (Husband) represented in my view a fair and just division of the matrimonial assets.

## Apportionment

52     Applying this ratio to the whole pool of matrimonial assets, I dealt with the apportionment as follows:

> (a)     Matrimonial Home

> I ordered the sale of the Matrimonial Home in the open market and made the orders set out in paragraphs 6(a)(i) to (iii) above. In terms of the time period for the completion of the sale, a period of 9 months from the date of the AM Order was specified in the order having taken into account the Wife’s counsel’s request for a longer period than the usual 3-month time frame for the sale. It should be noted that using the agreed figures set out earlier at paragraph 37, I had worked out the following with both counsel to ensure the workability of the order: The sale of the Matrimonial Home (based on a market value of $270,000) would result in the parties getting sale proceeds in the region of about $245,000 (after deducting the outstanding housing loan of about $25,000). And, after deducting the costs and expenses of the sale which should not be more than $10,000 (estimated), the balance sale proceeds that parties would likely receive would then be at least $235,000 (estimated). Based on these figures, the Wife’s 45% share of this sum would translate to about $105,750 (estimated). As for the Husband, his 55% share would translate to about $129,250 (estimated). Both parties would therefore be able to refund (from their respective shares of the balance sale proceeds) their CPF monies that were used for the purchase of the Matrimonial Home.

> Based on the Wife’s affidavit, she had withdrawn from her CPF account as at 21 September 2018, only a sum of about $5,806 (including accrued interest). That being so, the Wife should expect to receive an estimated cash sum of about $99,900 from the sale of the Matrimonial Home. As for the Husband, he would have to refund into his CPF account a larger sum given that he had, as of 21 June 2018, withdrawn $69,005 (principal) for the purchase of the Matrimonial Home with accrued interest of about $22,592. And consequently, he should expect to receive a cash balance of much less (about $37,653).

> (b)     Other Assets in pool (other than Matrimonial Home)

> I divided the rest of the other assets in the pool (shown in Table A) in the same ratio of 45 (Wife): 55 (Husband). The Wife’s 45% share of these other assets (totalling $92,506.71) would amount to $41,628.02. Deducting her existing amount of $26,620.08, she should therefore receive from the Husband a balance sum of about $15,008. This was rounded down to $15,000. As such, I made the orders in paragraph 6(a)(iv) that the Wife was entitled additionally to a sum of $15,000 of the Husband’s CPF monies pursuant to section 112 of the Charter and that the transfer of this sum of $15,000 would be made in accordance with the orders set out in paragraphs 6(a)(v) to (vi).

Save as set out above, each party was to retain all other assets held in his / her own name.

## Maintenance for the Wife and Children

53     I turn now to the claims for maintenance made by the Wife for herself and the Children. She sought a monthly sum of $800 for herself and $3,000 for the Children.

54     On the issue of a former wife’s maintenance, the relevant provisions were sections 113 and 114 of the Charter. It was ultimately a multi-factorial inquiry where the court was to have regard to all the circumstances of the case including those listed in section 114(a) to (g) of the Charter.

55     I was also mindful of the following guidelines set out by the Court of Appeal in the case of _ATE v ATD_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGCA 2</span>:

> (a)     The courts cannot and ought not to order nominal maintenance automatically or as a matter of course. The courts must examine closely all the facts and circumstances of the case before deciding whether or not to award nominal maintenance in order to preserve the former wife’s right to apply for future maintenance. It will not suffice for the wife to argue without more that she is entitled to an order of nominal maintenance simply because her situation might change in the future. The precise facts and circumstances of each case are of the first importance (at \[27\] to \[30\]).

> (b)     The courts ought always to bear in mind the underlying rationale and purpose for the award of maintenance generally to former wives. The overarching principle embodied in section 114(2) of the Charter is that of financial preservation which requires the wife to be maintained at a standard that is, to a reasonable extent commensurate with the standard of living she had enjoyed during the marriage – but section 114(2) has to be applied in a “commonsense holistic manner that takes into account the new realities that flow from the breakdown of marriage” (at \[31\]).

> (c)     There is an inter-relationship between sections 112 and 114 of the Charter, and that results in the power of the court to order a division of matrimonial assets being the primary power, with the power to order maintenance _supplementary_ to the power to order a division of matrimonial assets (at \[33\]).

56     On the issue of maintenance for the Children, I had regard to the provisions in sections 68, 69(4) and 127(1) of the Charter. Under section 68, both parents have an obligation to maintain their Children. Under sections 127(1) read with section 69(4), the court when ordering maintenance for the Children shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case including those set out in section 69(4) of the Charter. As regards the matters set out in section 69(4), Professor Leong Wai Kum (see _Leong Wai Kum, Elements of Family Law in Singapore, 2_nd_Edition, page 427_) has suggested that the 2 dominant factors for consideration by the court are (a) the financial needs of the child, and (b) the ability of the parent who is being sued for maintenance to meet those needs and that the maintenance order finally made may require a compromise between these 2 controlling factors.

#### Nominal maintenance for the Wife

57     In this case, the parties did not have much matrimonial assets for division. With my 45% award to the Wife and the apportionment set out in paragraph 52, the Wife would get an equitable share of the assets and have, as a result, cash in hand of at least about $99,900 (estimated) after her requisite CPF refunds, and another additional sum of $15,000 in her CPF account making a total of about $47,400 in her CPF accounts.

58     I noted that the Husband had been paying the Wife a monthly maintenance of $250 since June 2015 as part of his existing monthly maintenance obligations of $1,450 for the Wife and Children. However, his Elder Sister had also given evidence that she had been helping the Husband to make his monthly payments of $1,450. I accepted the Elder Sister’s evidence that she had been helping the Husband to maintain the Wife and the Children after his schizophrenia condition worsened and affected his ability to work. I noted that there was no maintenance owing by the Husband to the Wife or the Children at the time of the AM Hearing. The monthly maintenance sums had been paid even when the Husband was clearly not working and receiving treatment at IMH.

59     Based on the documentary evidence before me, the current salary of the Husband from his job at the School was $800 per month (take-home income of about $640). The Elder Sister’s evidence was that she could continue to help provide the Husband a monthly sum of $1,000 for the Husband’s maintenance obligations. Whilst I had questioned the deposits of funds into the Husband’s bank account in excess of his monthly take- home pay of about $640, those deposits (if one deducted the Elder Sister’s assistance of $1,450) were not substantial. Based on the bank statements, there were deposits of about $1,000 per month on an average that were not properly accounted for by the Husband. Even if I were to accept that the Husband’s current monthly salary was about $2,800 (as alleged), this would mean that his take- home pay after CPF deductions would be about $2,240. If he were to continue to pay monthly maintenance of $1,200 per month for his Children, this would leave him with about $1,000 per month. It would still be tight for the Husband to meet his daily needs including in particular, his medical expenses for the on-going treatment and medication for his schizophrenia.

60     As for the Wife, I noted that the Wife’s latest medical report dated 17 July 2019 from the Singapore National Eye Centre stated that her visually impaired left eye had a best corrected vision of 6/30, that she had difficulty in working due to her severe visual impairment and was unsuitable for jobs that require physical exertion. However, the report did not state that she was incapable of working. I noted that she was only 40 years old and she was still working at the time of the AM Hearing. Based on her affidavit of assets and means, she was earning an average of only about $300 to $500 per month in 2018. This was based on her working for about 15 hours a week (about 3 hours per weekday) at the time. However, I noted that she was fluent in English (having heard her speak at the 24 October 2019 session) and she was also registered with the Singapore Association for the Visually Handicapped where she could attend courses to learn more work skills for herself and improve her ability to find a more suitable job. However, even if she was able to find a more suitable job (than the current one), it was very likely that she would still require financial assistance.

61     At the hearing in August 2019, documentary evidence was produced which confirmed that the Wife was receiving financial assistance from ComCare and the Lee Foundation which gave her an aggregate cash sum of $1,150 per month for her needs. With the income from her part-time work, she had therefore a combined monthly cash sum of about $1,450 to $1,650 for her needs and expenses. In addition, ComCare also made direct payments for the Wife’s utility and conservancy charges to the relevant agencies. This amounted to $110 per month for her utilities, and $47 per month for her service and conservancy charges.

62     Finally and importantly, I noted that the Wife and the Children were also entitled to financial assistance at public healthcare institutions which included the public hospitals, the national specialty centres and polyclinics.

63     Given the above sums and the financial assistance provided to the Wife and Children, and upon review of the Wife’s claims and alleged expenses, I was of the view that the Wife was in a position to meet her reasonable personal expenses which I found to be about $950 per month as shown in the Table below (this sum took into account that the Wife has a public assistance card and would be receiving financial assistance at the public healthcare institutions for her existing eye condition and other health concerns).

64     All considered, I therefore decided that the Husband should not be required to provide any sum towards the monthly maintenance of the Wife post-divorce save that I ordered a nominal sum of $1.00 per month to preserve the Wife’s right to claim for maintenance from the Husband should there be a material change in her circumstances. In deciding to preserve the Wife’s right to vary the maintenance ordered, I had regard to the fact that if the condition in her left eye deteriorates further, she could become blind in both eyes. As for the Husband, whilst he was suffering from schizophrenia, his condition could still be managed with proper medication and as such, his employment prospects should still be more favourable than the Wife’s.

#### Children’s Maintenance to continue at $1,200 per month

65     As for the Children, I noted that the Husband had been paying monthly maintenance of $1,200 for the Children since September 2013. As mentioned earlier, there were no arrears in maintenance owing by the Husband for the Children at the time of the AM Hearing (although there were enforcement actions taken out by the Wife) and I had accepted the Elder Sister’s evidence that she had stepped in to help pay these maintenance sums for her brother when he was not able to do so because of his condition.

66     I noted that the Wife had asked for an increased monthly maintenance of $3,000 for the Children. But, based on the evidence of the Wife, the highest amount the Husband had ever earned was $2,800 when he was well and employed by his Elder Sister. As mentioned earlier, on the basis that he can still earn this same amount, and taking into account his own health issues and his need for medical care to control his schizophrenia, I found it reasonable for the Husband to continue to pay a monthly maintenance of $1,200 for the Children. I was also mindful that the Husband was staying in the Mother’s Flat and that he would also need to make some contribution on his part towards some common household expenses provided for him there, even if he was not in a position to provide any or much maintenance for his elderly Mother (in her 70s) and his mentally challenged second sister. The sum of $1,200 per month from the Husband would be able to cover the following essentials of the Children at the amounts as shown below:

67     For all the above reasons, I therefore made the orders set out in paragraphs 6(f) and (g) above. There was no order as to costs for the hearing of the ancillaries. However, I did order at the end that a penal notice addressed to both parties (in Form 136 as set out in Appendix A to the Family Justice Courts’ Practice Directions) be added to the AM Order.
