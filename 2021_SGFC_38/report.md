Family Law – Ancillary Matters – Division of Matrimonial Assets – Wife Maintenance

21 April 2021

### District Judge Goh Kiat Yi:

## Introduction

1       The present case concerns the ancillary matters following the dissolution of the marriage between the Plaintiff Husband (“the husband”) and the Defendant Wife (“the wife”). The issues in dispute are care and control, access to the children, division of matrimonial assets, wife and children maintenance. I heard parties on 17 December 2020 and delivered my decision on 12 January 2021 with reasons given.

2       In summary, I made the following orders:

> (a)     Parties shall have joint custody of the children of the marriage, namely, Child 1 and Child 2 (collectively known as the "Children") with care and control to the Defendant

> (b)     The Plaintiff shall have weekly supervised access to the Children at the Divorce Specialist Support Agency (“DSSA”) under the supervised visitation programme. Parties and the Children are to attend counselling at the DSSA.

> (c)     A review shall be fixed by the court after a report is submitted by the DSSA to the Court.

> (d)     The Defendant is to transfer her rights, interests and title (other than by way of sale) in the matrimonial flat at xxx (the "Matrimonial Flat") to the Plaintiff within 3 months from the date of the Final Judgment, upon the Plaintiff paying her a sum of $177,375.28, by way of a partial CPF transfer of a sum of $56,000.00 from the Plaintiff's CPF ordinary account to the Defendant’s CPF ordinary account and the remainder of $121,375.28 by cash or housing loan.

> (e)     If the Plaintiff is unable to effect the transfer, the Matrimonial Flat shall be sold in the open market within 6 months from the date of the Final Judgment and the net value of the Matrimonial Flat (being the sale price less cost and expenses of sale) be divided in the proportion 56% to the Plaintiff and 44% to the Defendant.

> (f)     The net cash proceeds (being the amount after refund of parties' CPF utilised towards the purchase of the Matrimonial Flat including accrued interest, less the cost and expenses of sale) is to be divided 56% to the Plaintiff and 44% to the Defendant. After the requisite refunds are made, the Plaintiff (hereinafter referred to as the "Member") shall transfer a sum (the "Ordered Amount”) being the shortfall, if any, for the Defendant hereinafter referred to as the "Spouse") to receive her 44% of the net value of the Matrimonial Flat from his CPF ordinary account to the Defendant’s CPF ordinary account pursuant to Section 112 of the Women's Charter (Chapter 353).

> (g)     Where there is an Ordered Amount to be transferred by the Member to the Spouse, the Central Provident Fund Board (the "CPF Board") shall within 1 month from the date of the completion of the sale of the Matrimonial Flat, from the money standing to the credit of the Member in the following CPF account(s), transfer the Ordered Amount specified to the Spouse's CPF ordinary account:

> (h)     The parties, via their solicitors or themselves, will confirm with the CPF Board the Ordered Amount, if any, to be transferred.

> (i)     The orders made herein are subject to the Central Provident Fund Act (Chapter 36) (the "CPF Act") and the subsidiary legislation made thereunder. The CPF Board shall give effect to the terms of this order in accordance with the provisions of the CPF Act and the subsidiary registration made thereunder.

> (j)     The Registrar or Deputy Registrar of the Family Justice Courts under section 31 of the Family Justice Act 2014 is empowered to execute, sign, or indorse all necessary documents relating to matters contained in this order on behalf of either party should either party fail to do so within seven (7) days of a written request being made to the party

> (k)     The parties, via their solicitors or themselves, will confirm with the CPF Board the Ordered Amount, if any, to be transferred.

> (l)     There shall be no order for maintenance for the Defendant

> (m)     The Plaintiff is to pay the Defendant monthly maintenance for the children of $2,000.00 (being $1,050.00 for Child 1 and $950.00 for Child 2) commencing the last day of the month where the Matrimonial Flat is transferred, but in any event no later than 28 February 2021 and thereafter on the last day of each month

> (n)     Payments to be made into the Defendant’s bank account POSB Bank XXX-XXXX-X.

> (o)     No order as to costs.

> (p)     Liberty to apply.

3       The wife has appealed only on the issues of the division of matrimonial assets and wife maintenance.

## Division of Matrimonial assets

9       It is common ground that the structured approach in _ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span> will apply. The court will first assess the pool of matrimonial assets, ascertain the appropriate ratio for division taking into account the parties’ direct and indirect contributions before giving effect to the division.

10     I applied the global assessment methodology as neither party suggested that the classification methodology should be utilised and I see no reason to do so.

### The pool of matrimonial assets

#### Disputed assets

##### (1)   The Qingdao Property

11     The wife alleges that the husband owns a property in Qingdao, China on the basis that he was residing there when he was in China and and it is also his registered address on his Chinese identification card.[^1] The husband’s position is that the property is owned by his father.[^2] Apart from the wife’s assertion, there is no other evidence to suggest that the husband owned the property and he had explained that this was simply the address which he had registered in his identification card.[^3] I accept the husband’s argument as registering an address on one’s identification card, without more, would not be sufficient evidence of ownership.

12     More importantly, whilst the husband did not produce the title deed of the house, he has produced a household registration certificate which states that his father had moved into that address since 1968. [^4] Given the existence of the property back in 1968, it is more likely that his father had purchased the property. I therefore exclude the Qingdao property from the pool of assets.

##### (2)   Insurance Policies

13     The dispute here relates to insurance policies in the name of the husband which are for the benefit of the children. As the husband would be entitled to the funds should the policies be surrendered and these policies were purchased during the marriage, these are matrimonial assets which should be included in the pool.

##### (3)   Amount in Husband’s BOC account

14     The dispute here concerns a sum of USD$1,000 remaining in the BOC account which was not transferred to the husband OCBC call account when he closed the former account. The wife argues this should be added into the pool of assets. I decline to include the sum as the amount is not a substantial sum and the transaction took place sometime ago on 28 February 2019 and may reasonably have been spent.

##### (4)   Fernvale Property

15     This is a property in the wife’s sole name acquired sometime in 2018 at the tail end of the marriage.[^5] Based on parties’ respective submissions, it is not disputed that at least a part of the property should be added into the pool but they disagree on the value to be ascribed.

16     The wife submits that only her CPF contributions paid towards the property should be added into the pool.[^6] This is because she would not have sufficient cash funds in view of her low salary and she had to maintain herself and the children since 2015.[^7] The husband takes the position that entire net value of the property, being the current value less the outstanding loan, should be added into the pool.

17     I agreed with the wife that the following passage in _AJR v AJS_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 4 SLR 617</span> would apply:

> “\[10\]… if there are any matrimonial assets (including cash) proved to have been expended by either party for his or her own investment purposes before the date of the Interim judgment and both parties did not intend for the other party to partake in the investment, then the total amount expended… would also be notionally added to the total value of matrimonial assets available for division”

18     It is clear in the present case that the wife had purchased this property at the tail end of the marriage long after the breakdown with no input from the husband at all. I would therefore add the amounts utilised by the wife in the purchase of the property rather than the net value to the pool of assets.

19     The remaining material dispute is the amount expended by the wife in the purchase of this property which should be added into the pool, in particular, her cash contributions. I found that the wife was less than candid on this issue as there were numerous inconsistencies in her evidence. First, the wife claimed in her first affidavit of assets and means (“AOM”) that the property was to be excluded because it was bought solely by her own monies.[^8] She then subsequently changed her position in her reply to discovery and interrogatories (“D&I”) dated 2 July 2019, stating that the property was paid from monies loaned from her parents and a mortgage loan.[^9] She then adopted yet another position in a further reply to D&I dated 30 September 2019, stating that a sum of 120000 RMB was transferred on 9 February 2018 by her cousin one KLM.[^10] In a further reply affidavit, she claims to have borrowed a total sum of $65,000 from KLM.[^11] Finally, in her 2nd AOM filed, her position was that the cash monies were borrowed from my family members in China namely my parent.[^12]

20     These were serious and material inconsistent positions which were unjustifiable especially since the purchase of the Fernvale property involved substantial sums and took place fairly recently in 2018. Importantly, there is no objective evidence such as loan documents or agreements from either her parents or KLM to prove the same. Neither have her family members filed any affidavits supporting her contentions.

21     I also considered her submissions on her alleged lack of means to pay. The total purchase price of the property is around $167,200.[^13] As she paid around $74,000 towards the purchase price using CPF monies, the remaining amount of around $93,000 would have been be paid using cash. I did not agree with the wife’s that she could not have afforded such an amount. By her own submissions, her cash balance of salaries over 8 years when she was employed would be $239,767.09.[^14] On top of this, it is important that she also had the benefit of a substantial amount from renting out of 1 to 2 rooms in the matrimonial flat since 2010 which would have helped defray her expenses, including that of the children.[^15] Ultimately, the wife bears the burden to prove that these cash payments towards the purchase of the property were not from matrimonial monies and I found that she failed to do so.

22     I therefore added both the cash and payments by CPF to the pool totaling a sum of $167,200 to the pool of assets.[^16]

#### Amounts that that should be returned to the pool in the Husband’s name

23     I turn now to the wife’s submission that certain sums expended by the husband ought to be returned to the matrimonial pool.[^17]

##### (5)   Legal costs of $6000

24     This amount of $6000 are legal fees paid by the husband which arose from his answers to D&I for a series of transactions. The wife argued on the authority of _UZN v UZM_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 109</span> (“_UZN_”) that legal costs are to be settled by parties out of their own share of the matrimonial assets after division.[^18] While the aforesaid principle is well accepted, the fact that the Court of Appeal added the legal costs back to the pool in that case must be viewed in context of the case. In _UZN_, the Court of Appeal noted that the lower court had returned the wife’s legal costs to the pool and ought to have done so for the husband’s legal costs as well.[^19]

25     In the present case, I did not think that it would be necessary to add the amounts to back to the pool simply because they were provided as answers to expenditures in interrogatories. This is not a substantial amount and importantly, the wife has also engaged counsel and legal fees spent by her have not been added back to the pool.

##### (6)   Sum of $1,000 and $18,653.82 expended under the TNL Dicta

26     The next item relates to a sum of $1,000 and $18,653.82 expended. In _TNL v TNK_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 1 SLR 609</span>, the Court of Appeal held that substantial sums expended by one spouse during the period in which divorce proceedings are imminent or after interim judgment but before the ancillaries are concluded, in the absence of consent from the other spouse, ought to be added back to the pool. This has been termed by the Court of Appeal more recently in _UZN_ as putative matrimonial assets not to be expended under the “TNL Dicta”.[^20]

27     With regards to the sum of $1,000 withdrawn on 9 September 2018, the husband has stated that he cannot remember the purpose of the withdrawal. This was a reasonable position as the transaction was sometime back and is of a small amount. I did not think that this can be said to be a substantial sum expended under the TNL dicta.

28     Turning to the sum of $18,653.82, I accepted the husband’s evidence based on the bank statements there was initially a deposit of $20,000 from his relatives for his niece to study in Singapore sometime in September 2015.[^21] The subsequent withdrawal of $18,653,82 is a consolidated debit “TDR” transaction when the passbook was updated around 3 years later.[^22] This was clearly a withdrawal that took place over a period of 3 years which means it is not on the a substantial withdrawal nor one which took place when divorce proceedings were imminent. The 3-year period is also conceivable with a typical period of studies supporting the husband’s position that the monies was used for convenience of the niece’s education in Singapore.

29     I therefore declined to return any of these amounts to the pool of assets.

##### (7)   The husband’s income which is unaccounted for.

30     The wife submits that an adverse inference should be drawn based on the alleged surpluses after taking into account the husband’s income over the period from 2015-2018 less his estimated expenses. Although the Court of Appeal did so in _UZN_, the Court also expressly cautioned adopting such an approach as a matter of course.[^23] In _UZN_, the husband had a substantial income as an equity partner of a law firm but only had $500 remaining in all his bank accounts[^24] whereas the husband has around $35,000 in his bank accounts in the instant case.[^25] I would add that the husband also has other substantial liquid assets such as his 3 insurance policies amounting to around $127,000 which would have been funded by cash premiums. I did not think this was a case necessitating an approach which seeks to scrutinize the husband’s income earned less his estimated expenses over several years.

31     Be that as it may, I considered the wife’s submissions on this issue but disagreed that an adverse inference ought to be drawn for the reasons that follow. The husband has provided his notice of assessment for income earned for the years of 2015 to 2019 (“the NOA”).[^26] It should be noted that his total take home income should be calculated after subtracting the income tax payable and less the CPF contributions as disclosed in the NOA. Based on these statements, his total take home local income for the 4 years from 2015-2018 is around $150,000.

32     As for his offshore income for 2018, the wife submits that the amount would be around USD18,375 ($24,623) based on the pay slips of Petroleum Resourcing Hong Kong. The husband’s position is that there were some errors in the pay slips and the company had only paid him USD14,375 ($19,263). I accepted the husband’s explanation that there were errors in the pay slips adopted the latter figure of USD14,375 ($19,263.00) as his salary. In any event, the difference between the figures is not substantial.

33     This brings his total net take home income for the 4-year period to around $170,000.

34     The husband’s personal expenses over the same 4-year period can be gleaned from a projection from his monthly list of expenses. [^27] I accepted the mother’s submissions that the husband’s rental of $250 should not be included as he only incurred rental sometime in July 2018 when he moved out of the matrimonial flat. I accepted the father’ utilities expenses partially as there is insufficient evidence that only the wife paid for it solely and the husband had averred that he did contribute. I accordingly apportioned the husband’s utilities expenses by half ($30). I also agreed with the wife that the husband’s festive expenses of $400 a month is excessive and unsupported by the documents and reduced this to $50 per month. I disagreed with the wife that a sum of $200 per month for holiday should be subtracted as it is a reasonable sum. Based on the foregoing, the husband’s total expenses over the 4 years would be around $90,000 \[being $118,896.00 (total claimed expenses) less $12,000 (removed rental) less $1,440 (reduced utilities) less $16,800 (reduced festive expenses).

35     At the same time a further sum of USD$6,800 ($9,112) being the living expenses paid for the children during that period should be added as the expense is proven by the father. [^28] I also added a further sum of $70,000 which he says he has spent on the children’s insurance.[^29] I note that these policies have also been included in the pool of assets and the surrender values of these 2 insurances total almost $100,000. This is in my view consistent with the amount of premiums paid by the husband.

36     I therefore assessed his total expenses in the 4-year period to $168,000 (being $90,000 add $9,112 add $70,000).

37     Based on the foregoing, there is no substantial discrepancy between his total income of $170,000 and expenses of $168,000 respectively. Even if he had additional offshore income which is a point strenuously argued by counsel, I did not think the difference would be substantial. Admittedly, the aforesaid exercise has been done in a broad-brush basis based on estimates with much hindsight. However, it would nonetheless show that there is insufficient evidence to draw an adverse inference against the husband.

#### Adverse inferences against the wife

38     The husband submits that there should be adverse inferences drawn against the wife for the various transfers in her ICBC bank accounts. I declined to do so for the following reasons. First, the material bank transactions have all not been translated to the English language in accordance with Rule 953 of the Family Justice Rules. It is difficult for the Court to verify what these transactions are, including their nature and purpose. Second, the wife’s take home pay is around $3,300 a month based her IRAS NOA.[^30] I have found above that she has paid the cash amounts towards the Fernvale property which is a substantial sum. I did not think she would have substantial assets concealed elsewhere on which I could draw an adverse inference.

#### Other assets that are substantially agreed

39     The rest of the assets in the matrimonial pool are substantially agreed save for marginal differences in the value of various bank accounts. Unless otherwise agreed by parties, I adopted the Defendant’s tabulation which took the amount closest to the IJ date of 11 March 2019. This is consistent with case authorities that the IJ date should be adopted for bank accounts as the matrimonial assets are the monies in the accounts rather than the accounts themselves.[^31]

40     Finally, there is also a property in Dalian China which the wife jointly holds with her father.[^32] Parties have reached a separate agreement on the Dalian property prior to the ancillary hearing where the husband, wife and the wife’s father would share the property in the proportion of 10:10:80 respectively. I therefore excluded this property from the division exercise.[^33]

41     In summary, I found the total pool of matrimonial assets to be a sum of **$1,010,333.32** as set out in the following table.

### Direct Financial Contributions

42     I turn to the parties’ respective direct financial contributions. As a starting point, the assets in the parties’ respective sole names can be taken to be contribution solely by them. The only material dispute concerns the cash contributions to the matrimonial flat.

43     I agreed with the husband that he should be accorded 100% of the cash contribution to the matrimonial flat as the Defendant herself stated she had made no direct financial contribution in her first AOM.[^34] The wife had only belated claimed in her 2nd AOM that she would transfer cash into the joint account but she had no proof to show for it and neither could she even remember what the figure was.[^35] I therefore attributed the cash contributions entirely to the husband. There would therefore be a further sum of $73,213 (being the CPF principle amount utilised) and $187,000 (being the cash payments) added to the husband’s direct contributions on top of the amount of assets in his sole name.

44     This brings their contributions to a total of $589,271.12 and $277,275 respectively which translates to a ratio of **68-32** in favour of the husband.

### Indirect Contributions

#### Indirect financial contributions

45     I turn now to indirect contributions starting with the financial matters. First, I note that there is little objective evidence supporting the parties’ respective indirect financial contributions. I was of the view that the husband indirect financial contribution would have been slightly more given that he was substantially at work throughout the marriage and his income was always higher than that of the wife. The wife’s own evidence is also that she did not work for 2 years between 2011 and 2012.

46     One significant area of dispute between the parties is the rental of the rooms in the matrimonial flat. I did not think that this was really a significant issue as the rooms in the matrimonial flat were rented out by consent of both parties until 2015 and no one really made any issue about it.[^36] It was only following the breakdown of the marriage sometime in 2015 that issues arose. Consequently, I do not make much of the allegations by each party on the income that was generated prior to the 2015 breakdown of the marriage as such rental income would generally be utilised to defray miscellaneous costs and family expenses.

47     As for the rental income post 2015, I accepted the wife’s evidence that the rental income would have been used to pay for the children’s expenses as the husband had stopped transferring any monies to her for maintenance of the children. I did not think there was a need for her to further account for the same as argued by the husband. At the same time, the husband should also be given due recognition for this indirect financial contribution given that a portion of the rental income would also have been due to him as a joint owner of the matrimonial flat. It is important to note that both counsel accepted that there is no evidence that the wife has ever sought maintenance for the children from the husband after 2015.[^37] This indicates that the rental monies did help to cover the children’s expenses.

48     Overall, I found that the husband would have made slightly more indirect financial contributions on a broad-brush basis given his higher salary.

#### Indirect non-financial contribution

49     As for indirect non-financial contribution, I found that the wife would have contributed more - she being the one who spent more time to the children compared to the husband especially in the last 10 years or so. However, I could not give the wife too much credit as compared to a usual case of a dual income family where both parents were working and the wife is the main caregiver. The present case is unique in that it is the wife’s own evidence that her father had come to Singapore to help care for the first child, Child 1, between 2006 to 2010, and when the parents had to go back to china, they would bring Child 1[^38] along as no one would be able to care for Child 1. It is also not disputed that children were substantially in China during most part of the marriage cared for by the Defendant’s parents. The wife herself was in Singapore and working, save for her trips back to China to visit the children.

50     Taking into account both the indirect financial and non-financial contributions above, I assessed the overall indirect contributions to be 60-40 in favour of the wife. This is also bearing in mind that this was a 15.5 year marriage with two children.

### Average Ratio

51     The average ratio based on the aforesaid findings would be 54-46 which I rounded off to **55-45** which would in my view would be a just and equitable division of the matrimonial assets on a broad-brush basis. There is also no reason to make further adjustments or give different weightages to the respective direct and indirect contributions.

### Effecting the division

52     Based on the division ratio, the husband and wife will be entitled to $555,683.33 and $454,649.99 of the pool of assets respectively. The wife presently has $277,275 of assets in her sole name and therefore on the basis that each party would retain their assets in their respective names, the wife would require a further sum of $177,375.28 from the division of the matrimonial flat.

53     I left it to both counsels to work out how to give effect to this decision as there was no material dispute over consequential orders. They updated me at costs hearing that the husband would have the first option to take over the flat upon him paying the wife the sum of $177,375.28 in cash or by way of CPF, failing which the flat will be sold and parties would receive their respective shares based on their proportional entitlement to the net value of the matrimonial flat which is 56-44 in favour of the husband. The orders were thereafter extracted by counsel on this understanding.

## Wife Maintenance

54     I turn now to the issue of wife maintenance.

### The law of maintenance of a former spouse

55     The Court of Appeal in _ATE v ATD_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGCA 2</span> (“ATE”) has set out the key principles on maintenance of a former spouse. The Court noted citing an earlier decision in _Foo Ah Yan v Chiam Heng Chow_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 2 SLR 506</span>) that the overarching principle embodied in s 114(2) is that of financial preservation, which requires the wife to be maintained at a standard that is, to a reasonable extent, commensurate with the standard of living she had enjoyed during the marriage, also to be applied in a “commonsense holistic manner that takes into account the new realities that flow from the breakdown of marriage”.[^39]

56     The Court of Appeal also accepted the proposition that the power to order maintenance is supplementary to the power to order division of matrimonial assets and courts regularly take into account each party’s share of the matrimonial assets when assessing the appropriate quantum of maintenance to be ordered. Finally, the award of maintenance for a former wife takes into account the fact that the former wife ought to try to regain self-sufficiency and that an order of maintenance is not intended to create life-long dependency by the former wife on the former husband.[^40]

### Findings on wife maintenance

57     It is the wife’s own position that she has had a steady employment as early as June 2009.[^41] The evidence shows that she has never had to depend on the husband for her own maintenance. Further, the wife was also by all means industrious as she could partition the home and rent out several rooms in the matrimonial home for income. Parties were also very much living separate lives for the last 5 years with little reliance on each other for their own expenses. I also note above that the children have been cared for substantially in China by the maternal grandparents and the wife has remained in Singapore and was working. I do not think she would have suffered significant financial prejudice from the marriage and this is borne out by her steady employment. In relation to the children, I have also made orders for the husband to pay child maintenance at $1,050 for Child 1 and $950 for Child 2 and there is no appeal against this aspect of my decision. Finally, the wife would also receive around 45% of the matrimonial pool at $454,000 and I did not think she would need any further maintenance from the husband.

58     For the foregoing reasons, I made no order for wife maintenance.

## Conclusion

59     I made no order as to costs as neither party succeeded fully in their respective submissions.
