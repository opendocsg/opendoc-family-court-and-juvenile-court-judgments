Family law – Ancillary matters – Shared care and control of children – Children’s maintenance

4 February 2020

### District Judge Darryl Soh:

## Introduction

1       This matter concerns ancillary reliefs arising from divorce proceedings between the Plaintiff-Wife (“the Wife”) and the Defendant-Husband (“the Husband”) (collectively referred to as “the Parties”). Prior to the hearing on 7 November 2019, the Parties resolved matters pertaining to the division of their matrimonial assets, the Wife’s maintenance, and the joint custody of their two children. The Parties however could not reach an agreement on their children’s care and control and their children’s maintenance. Those were the only two issues to be adjudicated by the court. At the conclusion of the hearing, I ordered for the Parties to be granted shared care and control of their children, the consequential sharing of time between the Parties, and for the Parties to bear their children’s expenses equally. The Wife appealed against my orders. In these grounds, I explain my decision in detail.

## Background Facts

2       The Parties were married in XXX in Singapore and they have two children – they have a daughter aged four and a son aged two. The Wife is 41 years of age and she is a XX1 in a XXX. The Husband is 46 years of age and he is a XX2 in the XXX. The Parties resided in their matrimonial flat in \[address redacted\] between 2015 and 2019 and both children attended XXX \[address redacted\]. Due to differences between the Parties, the Wife left the matrimonial flat in February 2019 together with their son and they moved into a rented flat in \[address redacted\].

3       The Wife also withdrew[^1] their son from XXX and enrolled him in full-time day care at XXX in \[address redacted\] near the Wife’s rented flat.[^2] The daughter remained in the care of the Husband in the matrimonial flat and their daughter continued to attend the same preschool. Their daughter will be in K1 in 2020. The Wife averred that she did not bring their daughter along when she moved out of the matrimonial flat because she knew it was not right to disrupt the daughter’s care arrangements.[^3]

4       The Wife filed for divorce on 26 February 2019, citing the Husband’s gambling habit as the root cause of the breakdown of their marriage. The divorce proceeded on an uncontested basis, on account that the Husband has behaved in such a way that the Wife cannot reasonably be expected to live with the Husband. When Interim Judgment was granted on 24 July 2019, the court recorded a consent order on the Parties’ agreement on the division of their matrimonial assets, the Wife’s maintenance, and the joint custody of their children. Materially, for the purposes of these Grounds of Decision, the Parties had agreed to sell their matrimonial flat within nine months of Final Judgment.

5       Since the Wife left the matrimonial flat in February 2019, the Parties were effectively having split interim care and control of the children; their son was in the care of the Wife and their daughter was in the care of the Husband. In order to ensure that the siblings had sufficient time to bond together, the Parties agreed that the siblings would reside together with the Husband overnight on Fridays and similarly with the Wife on Saturdays.[^4] As I will explain below, this _status quo_ of the children’s care arrangements is of particular importance in this case.

## Issues in Dispute and Decision

6       The Parties submitted two issues to the court for adjudication; the care and control of their children, and their children’s maintenance. The case before me was rather peculiar. Both parents had effectively split interim care and control of their children and they exhibited the _ability_ to work together to co-parent after their marriage broke down. However, they each prayed for sole care and control of their children in their respective individual favour. Through their counsel, I asked to see the Parties on the day of the hearing to highlight the peculiar state of affairs and to ascertain whether they would be willing to consider shared care and control of their children. I suggested a two-week modality wherein their children will reside with one parent during weekdays and thereafter reside with the other parent on weekends commencing Friday evening, with this arrangement alternating between the Parties every two weeks.

7       After speaking to the Parties, the Husband agreed with the court’s suggestion but the Wife did not. Through her counsel, she explained that she was reluctant to do so because of the alleged acrimonious relationship between the Parties and the practical difficulties that would ensue from a shared care and control arrangement.

8       I proceeded to hold a hearing on the contested issues and I granted the Parties shared care and control of their children with a two-week modality commencing 2 December 2019. That is, for their children to first live with the Wife for two weeks during weekdays from Sunday 7pm until Friday 7pm and thereafter with the Husband from Friday 7pm until Sunday 7pm. After two weeks, their children are to live with the Husband for two weeks during the weekdays from Sunday 7pm until Friday 7pm and thereafter with the Wife from Friday 7pm until Sunday 7pm. The cycle is to repeat itself thereafter.

9       As part of my consequential orders, I ordered that the Party who their children will be living with shall have the responsibility of picking them up from the other Party’s home. In addition, I ordered that the Parties shall consult each other on the issues of their children’s extra-curricular activities and they are to share all public and school holidays equally. If the Parties are unable to agree on the schools to be registered for their children, I granted the Parties the liberty to write in for a case conference. I also ordered the Parties to attend counselling at a Divorce Support Specialist Agency so as to assist them to talk through the finer details required for the implementation of the shared care and control order.

10     With respect to their children’s expenses, I ordered the Parties to each bear all living expenses of their children when they are in the Parties’ respective care, save that the Parties’ are to share equally their children’s school and education related expenses, medical and dental expenses not covered by employer benefits or by insurance, and insurance premiums.

11     Finally, I ordered the Parties to bear their own costs for the proceedings and granted them liberty to apply.

12     The Wife appealed against my orders.

## Care and Control of their Children

### Submissions on Sole Care and Control

13     The Parties each submitted in their Written Submissions and Affidavits of Assets and Means for sole care and control of their children in their respective individual favour.

14     The Wife’s case was relatively straightforward. Counsel for the Wife argued that sole care and control in favour of the Wife was in their children’s best interests because of several reasons. First, the Wife submitted that she was in a better position to care for their children. The Wife averred that she is a hands-on mother who has been the main caregiver of their children.[^5] She has a flexible schedule, she does not need to work on weekends, and she has the option of working from home should she be required to do overtime to complete tasks.[^6] Her family will also be able to assist in caring for their children.[^7]

15     Second, the Wife pointed to the alleged flaws of the Husband. She submitted that the Husband is not prudent with his finances and has a gambling habit.[^8] She also claimed that the Husband has a violent disposition and physically intrusive.[^9]

16     Third, the Wife advanced a competent care plan for their children. If she is granted sole care and control of their children, she will rent an apartment near \[address redacted\], which is close to her mother’s flat. Similarly, once the matrimonial flat is sold, she will buy an apartment in \[address redacted\]. She will enrol their children in day care wherein either she or her mother will ferry them to and from home. To that end, she has secured a place for their daughter in the same day care that their son currently attends.[^10] Crucially, she submitted that she wants the Husband to continue being involved in their children’s growing up as far as he can by having him see them frequently and play his part by way of access.[^11] She will accordingly be inclusive in facilitating the Husband’s access to their children.[^12] She proposed that the Husband have access to their children from Friday 6pm to Saturday 8pm every week, dinner on Wednesdays, and essentially that the Parties generally share school and public holidays equally with their children.[^13]

17     In opposing a shared care and control arrangement, the Wife’s counsel cited the lack of stability for the children. For instance, the children will have to wake up in different homes and the Wife was unsure which address to use when registering their children for primary school. Shared care and control is also unsuitable because the Parties allegedly have an acrimonious relationship. The Wife’s counsel submitted that the Parties will not be able to agree which primary school their children should attend and the extra-curricular activities that their children can pursue.

18     Opposing the Wife’s submissions, the Husband’s counsel argued that the Husband is the better parent to care for their children and that the Husband should consequently be granted sole care and control of their children. The Husband averred that the children are very close to him and that his job involved regular working hours and superiors who provide him flexibility should he need time off to care for their children.[^14] The Husband emphasised that he has strong family support to care for their children and explained that his family has been heavily involved in their children’s lives since their birth and their children’s paternal grandmother has been the main secondary caregiver.[^15]

19     To the Husband and his counsel’s credit, the Husband did not distastefully put down the Wife’s case but rather emphasised the relatively more deliberative care plan he had for their children. If he is granted sole care and control of the children, he intends to move closer to his family by purchasing a flat in \[address redacted\], near to his sister’s apartment. He elaborated that the said area has a nearby community centre that provides enrichment classes.[^16] He also intends to register their children at XXX located in the vicinity. He had already contacted the centre and was informed that the centre has vacancies for their children from January 2020.[^17] The Husband also proposed a more generous access schedule for the Wife so that she may bond with their children. He suggested that the Wife be granted weekend access from Fridays after school to Sunday 2pm save for the last weekend of every month, weekday dinner access on Thursdays, and essentially submitted that the Parties generally share school and public holidays equally with their children.[^18]

20     Following the court’s suggestion for a shared care and control arrangement, the Husband indicated that he was agreeable to the 2-week modality laid out in \[6\] above.

### Decision on Care and Control

21     There was no dispute between the Parties on the applicable legal principles to be applied. In deliberating the appropriate care orders to be made, s. 125 of the Women’s Charter \[Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed\] prescribes that the paramount consideration for the court shall be the welfare of the child. Having considered the Parties’ respective submissions and affidavits, I was of the view that it is in the children’s best interests _in the circumstances of this case_ that the Parties be granted share care and control, on a two-week modality.

22     In _TAU v TAT_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 1089</span> (“_TAU v TAT_”) at 1095, Justice Debbie Ong observed that in considering whether shared care and control would be in the child’s welfare, the court will have to consider several factors. This included the particular child’s needs at that stage of life, the extent to which the parents are able to co-operate within such an arrangement, and whether it is easy for that child, bearing in mind his or her age and personality, to live in two homes within one week.

23     First, I was of the view that a shared care and control arrangement will _continue_ to afford each parent significant time with their children and will _continue_ keeping both parents actively involved in their children’s development bearing in mind the _status quo_ of their children’s care arrangements. This will ensure better outcomes for their children, and it is the next best alternative to the existing split interim care and control of their children. It was clear that the _status quo_ care arrangement should not continue since the siblings had limited opportunities to bond at such a crucial stage of their development. It was apparent that the Parties recognised this as neither parent submitted for the _status quo_ to continue and both had rightly agreed for the siblings to spend time together, albeit that it was only for the weekends while the Parties go through the divorce process.

24     Second, it was clear to me that the Parties are both well placed to care for their children and it cannot be said that one parent is better than the other. The Parties love their children dearly and both have exhibited in the _status quo_ that they are more than capable of looking after their children individually.[^19] The Parties are both working full-time jobs and both averred that they have flexible work arrangements that afforded them the time to care for their children – the Wife being able to work from home when needed, and the Husband being granted time off when required. Similarly, the Parties both have competent family support to assist with the care of their children and both intended to have the children enrolled in day care.

25     The Wife had sought to portray herself as a better parent in several aspects. The Wife averred that the Husband has a violent disposition and was physically intrusive. The Husband strongly disputed the allegations and argued that the Wife should have taken out an application for a Personal Protection Order if the allegations were true.[^20] I agreed with the Husband. There was also no evidence that the Husband was a violent person or that he had been violent towards the children.

26     The Wife also sought to undermine the Husband’s ability to care for the children on the basis that he suffered from a gambling habit. She feared that their children would be vulnerable should there be harassment from debt collectors. The Husband was quick to admit that he used to have a gambling problem but pointed to steps that he has taken to address the problem. He has been under a Voluntary Self-Exclusion Order since 2011 and he has been attending counselling for his gambling habit. The Husband further averred that he has not gambled since January 2019 and, even if he had gambled, he never borrowed money from unlicensed moneylenders and does not owe money to any bank, licensed moneylenders, or loan sharks.[^21] In my view, on a balance of probabilities, the Husband has taken active and preventive steps to address his gambling habit. Crucially, I did not find any evidence that compromised the Husband’s ability to care for their children. The Husband has been the primary caregiver of their daughter since February 2019 and there were no gambling habit related harassment incidents reported.[^22] Further, if the Wife was truly concerned with the Husband’s gambling habit and its impact on the safety of their children, it would have made no sense for her to allow her daughter to remain in the Husband’s care.

27     Third, the Parties had clearly exhibited their ability to co-parent for the best interests of their children. Since the breakdown of the Parties’ relationship and after the Wife moved out of the matrimonial flat, the Parties exhibited how they are capable of making decisions that are in the children’s best interests notwithstanding their differences of opinion and disagreements. When the Parties previously discussed their children’s care arrangements, both at various points agreed for the other parent to have care and control.[^23] The Parties also ensured that the siblings continued to see each other by way of having the siblings reside together over weekends and having the siblings communicate regularly over video conferencing.[^24] In fact, the Husband kept a record of the Parties’ co-parenting relationship after the breakdown of their marriage.[^25] Though his intention was to show how proactive he was in looking after their daughter so as to lend weight to his prayer for sole care and control, the records unintentionally detailed the Parties’ capability to work together for the children’s care arrangements. Whilst not perfect and the Parties had several disagreements documented, the records clearly showed the ability of the children to live in two households.

28     The Wife’s basis for rejecting a shared care and control arrangement appeared to be aligned with the observations made by the High Court in _AQL v AQM_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 840</span> (“_AQL v AQM_”). In that case, the father appealed against the liberal access granted him in respect of the parties’ 3-year-old child and sought a shared care and control order. In dismissing the father’s appeal, the High Court found that shared care and control was not in the best interests of that child and took the view that such an order would be too disruptive to the constancy of routine that the child required. The court also observed that uprooting the child every three to four days, or even every fortnight, to a new home will be overly disruptive, reasoning that young children require a familiar and secure base-camp to which they may retreat when confronted with the myriad challenges of growing up. The court also found that the animosity between the parents and their resulting inability to compromise would exacerbate the sense of disruption. I was consequently mindful of the observations in _AQL v AQM_ though I was equally mindful that acrimony in and of itself does not rule out the possibility of an order for shared control. It is only a relevant factor in the overall analysis of whether such an order would be in the child’s welfare. See _TAU v TAT_ at 1097.

29     In the circumstances of the present case, unlike the parties in _AQL v AQM_, I did not find that the Parties’ relationship to be acrimonious. In oral submissions, the Wife’s counsel characterised the Parties’ relationship as acrimonious and submitted that shared care and control is consequently inappropriate. I did not agree with the characterisation since it was not borne out by the evidence. The Parties had disagreements but it was inaccurate to equate those disagreements as acrimony since the Parties could work through their differences, compromise, or accept the decisions that were made by each of them. For instance, the Husband averred that he pleaded with the Wife to allow their son to remain in XXX[^26] but the Wife decided against that plea and moved their son to a new school. Once the decision was made, the Parties moved on. Similarly, the Wife herself admitted that she “knew it was not right to disrupt \[their daughter\]’s care arrangement” and agreed to have their daughter remain in \[address redacted\] so that she can continue attending the same day care.[^27] The Wife was comfortable having the daughter remain in the Husband’s care notwithstanding the breakdown in their relationship. In my view, while there were differences in opinion and disagreements, it was clear that both parties could as a whole look past their differences and focus on what was in their children’s best interests.

30     The Wife’s counsel also submitted that shared care and control was also inappropriate because she foresees that the Parties could not agree on their children’s schooling and extra-curricular activities. I was unpersuaded by this submission. The issue of schooling falls within the realm of custody matters, which is to be determined jointly between the Parties pursuant to their agreement for joint custody. I was similarly unpersuaded that disagreements on the choice and scheduling of extra-curricular activities ought to necessarily determine whether shared care and control is appropriate. Citing future disagreements in the circumstances of this case was disconcerting since it was a disproportionate response against the best interests of the children. Their children are comfortable in both the Parties’ individual care and they have benefited from the proactive involvement of both parents, albeit in separate homes. Raising a child is not an exact science and there can be legitimate and reasonable differences in opinion between parents. The more important inquiry is whether the Parties are able to work through their disagreements and co-parent. In my view, the Parties have done so in the past and there is no reason why they will not be able to do so in the future. It was apparent to me that whilst the Parties are capable of working together for their children’s best interests, they appeared somewhat reluctant to do so. In particular, I found it curious and ironic that the Wife was the party alleging acrimony and the lack of consensus when the records kept by the Husband documented the Wife being the relatively less compromising between the Parties.[^28]

31     Fourth, in light of the present split interim care and control arrangement, I was of the view that there was limited weight in the argument for continuity in this case since change will ensue whatever order that is made. The Parties each prayed for sole care and control, the result of which is that one of the two children will no longer be able to interact with the other parent for the most part of their daily routine. Similarly, both the Parties intended to move away from \[address redacted\] after the matrimonial flat is sold and both their parenting plans involved their children moving to a different day care. The Wife also argued that it was not in their children’s best interests to wake up in different homes pursuant to the two-week modality suggested by the court. This was similar to the High Court’s observations in _AQL v AQM_ but I find this argument to be of limited weight in the particular circumstances of this case. The children are already waking up in different homes on weekends and the two-week modality essentially serves to establish a routine that is the most appropriate alternative, in my view, to the Parties’ present split interim care and control arrangement.

32     I further noted that both the Parties have yet to crystallise their plans after the matrimonial flat is sold – they agreed that the matrimonial flat is to be sold within nine months of Final Judgment. The Wife indicated that she intended to move to \[address redacted\] and the Husband indicated that he intended to move to \[address redacted\]. Their respective choices for these locations are entirely understandable given the respective location’s proximity to their own family members who can assist in the care of the children. I did not however place significant weight to this factor because both of the Parties’ plans involve having the children attend full-time day care.

33     In light of the close relationship that both children share with the Parties, I was of the view that it was imperative for the Parties to find better solutions that are in their children’s best interests, and where required, make the necessary sacrifices for them. They ought to do so because the two-week modality affords each parent significant time to bond with the children in light of the unique circumstances of this case. For example, the Parties should make their best efforts to move into a common neighbourhood so that the children can be located in the same day care and have short commutes regardless of the homes they are to reside in for a particular week. I suggested this approach to the Parties during the hearing and the Husband was agreeable to move to the \[address redacted\] part of Singapore, the midway point between both of their respective families. The Husband also indicated that he is happy for the _status quo_ to continue until the matrimonial flat is sold and while the Parties plan ahead to implement the shared care and control order. I found the Husband’s attitude constructive, one which ought to be encouraged.

34     Finally, I did not find the young age of both children to stand in the way of a shared care and control order. I was mindful of the observations made in _AQL v AQM_ on the effect of such orders for young children – in that case, the child was 3 years age – but every case must be determined on its own facts. See _TAU v TAT_ at 1096. The children have been the subject of a split interim care and control arrangement and they share a close relationship with both parents who are able to co-parent. I was consequently of the view that the present circumstances differed from those in _AQL v AQM_.

35     In order to assist the Parties and their children in the transition, I ordered for the two-week modality for shared care and control to commence only from 2 December 2019. This will allow the children the opportunity to adjust to the new routine during the holidays where the pace of daily routines would be more forgiving to the entire family. I also ordered the Parties to attend counselling at a Divorce Support Specialist Agency so that experienced counsellors can guide the Parties to talk through the finer details of implementing the shared care and control order.

## Children’s Maintenance

36     The Parties’ individual incomes were approximately similar; the Wife and the Husband earned an average monthly income of $7,844.00 and $7,418.32 respectively. As I ordered a two-week modality premised on the Parties having equal time with their children, I found it fair and reasonable for the Parties to bear all living expenses of the children when they are in the Parties’ respective care, save that the Parties’ are to share equally their children’s school and education related expenses, medical and dental expenses not covered by employer benefits or by insurance, and insurance premiums.

## Conclusion

37     There is much hope for the future of this family despite the breakdown of the Parties’ marriage. Contrary to the Wife’s arguments and submissions, the Parties are more than capable of looking past their personal differences and make decisions that are in their children’s best interests. They are each blessed with a loving relationship with their children and there is no doubt that their children will benefit from the continued active involvement of the Parties in their lives. They need to remember this and they need to work harder to find solutions that will help the children bond and grow with the other parent. I found the Parties to have acted within the margins of reasonable conduct during these proceedings and I consequently ordered them to bear their own costs for the proceedings.
