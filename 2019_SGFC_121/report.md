Continual harassment – Personal Protection Order

8 November 2019

### District Judge Christine Lee:

### Introduction

1       The Appellant has filed an appeal in DCA 90 of 2019 against the whole of the Court’s decision given on 30 July 2019 regarding the Respondent’s application for a Personal Protection Order against him in SS 881/2019.

### Background Facts

2       The Respondent Ex-Wife (“the Respondent”) and Appellant Ex-Husband (“the Appellant”) married on \[xxx\] 2004 in Singapore. There is one child from the marriage namely, \[C\] (f) DOB \[xxx\] 2010 now aged nearly 9 years old (“the said child”).

3       The Respondent filed Writ of Divorce on 4 October 2016 and Interim Judgement was granted on 17 April 2017 based on both the Respondent’s Statement of Claim and the Appellant’s Counterclaim. Certificate of Final Judgement was issued on 20 November 2018.

4       On 26 April 2019, the Respondent filed an application for a Personal Protection Order in SS 881/2019 for herself and the said child regarding family violence allegedly committed by the Appellant on 24 April 2019. An Expedited Order was also issued in EO 562/2019 on 26 April 2019.

5       On 15 May 2019, the Appellant also filed an application for a Personal Protection Order in SS 1038/2019 regarding family violence allegedly committed by the Respondent against him on the same date, being 24 April 2019.

### Hearings before the Court

6       The Court dealt with both applications on two hearing dates being 1 July 2019 and 30 July 2019 whereupon the Court delivered its decision.

7       The Court granted the Respondent’s application for a Personal Protection Order in SS 881/2019 for herself only but not for the said child against the Appellant. The Court dismissed the Appellant’s application for a Personal Protection Order in SS 1038/2019 for himself against the Respondent.

8       The Appellant then filed Notice of Appeal on 8 August 2019 in HCF/DCA 90/2019 against the whole of the Court Order issued on 30 July 2019 (“the said Court Order”) regarding the Court’s decision in SS 881/2019.

### The Appeal

9       The Appellant’s appeal is against the whole of the said Court Order as set out below (italics added).

> **The said Court Order**

> _Whereas on the 30th day of July 2019, \[the Appellant\] appeared before the Court on the application of \[the Respondent\] for a personal protection order._

>> _IT IS ORDERED (UNTIL VARIED OR DISCHARGED ACCORDING TO LAW):_

>> _3_.     _That this case is fixed for review on 30 January 2020 at 9.30am before Family Court 1._

### Summary of the Court’s reasons for making its Order

10     The relevant provisions of the Women’s Charter regarding Personal Protection Orders (PPOs) are set out in sections 64 (definition of family violence) and 65 (granting of a PPO). Under these provisions, two limbs have to be satisfied: (i) that an act of family violence has been committed or is likely to be committed and (ii) that it is necessary for the protection of the family member that a PPO should be issued. Once the first limb has been proved, the second limb is likely to operate unless the protection is thought to be unnecessary[^1]. Reference is also made to the case of _Yue Tock Hin @Yee Chok Hin v Yee Ee Lim_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGDC 99</span> on the second limb of this provision.

11     During the Examination in Chief of the Respondent, the Court noted that the Summons served on the Appellant dated 26 April 2019, referred to alleged family violence committed on 24 April 2019[^2]. However, when the Court asked the Respondent why she thought that it was necessary that a PPO be issued against the Appellant for her protection, the Respondent informed that Court that she was also relying on the 4th limb of section 64 of the Women’s Charter being “continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member”[^3].

12     The Respondent testified that the Appellant had continually harassed her through daily emails which caused her a lot of mental stress and resulted in the Respondent being unable to sleep at night, focus on her work and affected her relationships with her colleagues, friends and family[^4].

13     Therefore, in addition to assessing whether the Appellant’s acts on 24 April 2019 amounted to family violence, the Court also assessed whether the Appellant’s emails to the Respondent amounted to continual harassment within the meaning of section 64 of the Women’s Charter.

#### Spitting and attempt to kick Respondent

14     The Court’s assessment of the evidence presented during the two hearing days was that there was sufficient evidence on a balance of probabilities, that the 1st and 2nd limbs of section 64, being (a) wilfully or knowingly placing or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt and (b) causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been know would result in hurt, had been made out.

15     The Court made this assessment based on the Court’s finding that the Respondent’s testimony of the Appellant’s act of spitting on her and attempting to kick her on 24 April 2019[^5], was credible and believable as compared to the Appellant’s testimony[^6]. The Court’s assessment was that the Respondent gave consistent and credible evidence that the Appellant had spat on her and she pushed him away. This resulted in the Appellant attempting to kick her which caused the Appellant to slip and fall.

16     The Court also took note of the Appellant’s attempts to discredit the Respondent by lengthy cross-examination of the distance between them at the time of the spitting incident on 24 April 2019[^7]. The Appellant’s behaviour towards the Respondent regarding this single point of the Respondent’s testimony, reinforced the Court’s assessment of the aggressiveness displayed by the Appellant towards the Respondent.

17     The Appellant also confirmed to the Court that the act of spitting was not disputed[^8]. However, the Appellant’s case was that he had spat on the Respondent when he was falling down after the Respondent had allegedly pushed him. At the same time, the Appellant agreed with the Court that the distance between himself and the Respondent would have increased when he was falling[^9]. The Court’s assessment was that the Appellant’s version was not credible and that his testimony was an attempt to give credence to his own application for a PPO against the Respondent.

#### Continual harassment

18     The Court noted that in the case of _Malcomson Nicholas Hugh Betram v Naresh Kumar Mehta_ \[2001\] 3 SLR (R) 379, the High Court considered this issue and the English position on acts of harassment[^10]. Based on the afore-mentioned case law, the Court was of the view that in the present case, it was appropriate to adopt a common-sense meaning as to whether the Appellant’s emails amounted to continual harassment.

19     The Court also noted that the evidence showed that between 9 February 2019 to 10 May 2019, the Appellant had sent almost daily email messages to the Respondent[^11]. In this regard, the Appellant admitted that on a single day, being 11 February 2019, he had sent 17 email messages to the Respondent within the space of 4 hours[^12]. However, the Appellant testified that the number of these emails should not be considered as spam because emails were the only means that he had of communication with the Respondent.

20     The Appellant further testified that he had sent the 17 emails on 11 February 2019 because these were “for important matters[^13]”. However, the Court noted that there were no subject headings to these 17 emails “for important matters”. The Court’s assessment was that it would have been reasonable for anyone sending important matters by email to at least state in the subject heading, what the emails were for, so that the recipient would be alerted as to the fact that the emails were on important matters. The Court therefore found the Appellant’s testimony on this to be not credible.

21     The Court further noted that for most of the emails sent by the Appellant to the Respondent as exhibited for the hearing, that these emails did not have any subject heading, in particular, the 39 emails sent by the Appellant to the Respondent over a period of 3 days between 9 February 2019 to 11 February 2019[^14].

22     The Respondent also testified and exhibited emails from the Appellant dated 14 October 2018, 20 October 2018, 12 February 2019 and 19 April 2019 regarding offensive emails from the Appellant[^15]. In his response, the Appellant at first denied that he had used offensive language in the emails to the Respondent’s then lawyers. However, the Appellant later admitted that he had used vulgar language in his email messages to the Respondent and had used offensive language to the Respondent’s then lawyers[^16]. The Appellant further testified that he agreed with the Court that using such offensive language was not appropriate and that he would not use such inappropriate language in the future.

23     The Court’s assessment was that the Appellant only changed his testimony when it was pointed out to him that the evidence showed that these emails were not what he had claimed. The Court found that the Appellant’s inconsistent testimony made him an unreliable witness and affected his credibility adversely.

### Conclusion

24     The Court was satisfied on a balance of probabilities, that the evidence showed that the Appellant had committed family violence against the Respondent by spitting at her and attempting to kick the Respondent, which acts fall under the 1st and 2nd limbs of section 64 of the Women’s Charter.

25     At the conclusion of the two-day hearing, the Court’s assessment of the Respondent was that she had suffered tremendous mental anguish due the Appellant’s emails and that she was in real fear of him as shown in her testimony of the events on 24 April 2019. Therefore, the Court was also satisfied on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant’s’ almost daily email messages as shown in Exhibit C1, amounted to continual harassment within the meaning of the 4th limb of section 64 of the Women’s Charter.

26     In addition, the Appellant’s demeanour of aggressiveness[^17] during his cross-examination of the Respondent in Court and her response thereto, reinforced the Court’s assessment that the Respondent was clearly in fear of the Appellant[^18].

27     Accordingly, the Court was of the view that the Respondent was in need of protection and granted the Respondent’s application for a PPO against the Appellant under section 65 of the Women’s Charter in SS 881/2019.

28     However, the Court was not convinced that the said child required a PPO against her own father, the Appellant, and therefore dismissed this part of the Respondent’s application in SS 881/2019.
