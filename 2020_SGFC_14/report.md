Family Law – Ancillaries – Division of Matrimonial Assets – Maintenance

31 January 2020

### District Judge Lo Wai Ping:

## Background

1       This case involves a marriage of about 6 ½ years and the parties have one child, a daughter (“**Child**”). Both parties were represented by legal counsel at all times.

2       The parties were married in February 2012 in India. It was an arranged marriage. Thereafter, the plaintiff-wife (“**Wife**”) moved to Singapore to be with the defendant-husband (“**Husband**”) who was already working in Singapore for a few years. The Child was born in February 2013. The parties and their Child are all Indian citizens and they have been Singapore permanent residents since early 2013.

3       On 1 February 2018, the Wife filed for divorce alleging that the marriage had broken down due to the Husband’s unreasonable behaviour. The Husband contested the divorce.

4       Following the agreement of the parties at mediation, interim judgment for the divorce (“**Interim Judgment**”) was granted on the Wife’s claim on 15 August 2018 on an uncontested basis. It was also agreed, at mediation, that the Wife would have interim care and control of the Child pending the hearing of the ancillaries. At the material time, the Wife and Child were staying in a shelter, having left the matrimonial home in January 2018. As for access, the Father had applied for liberal access to the Child, but I eventually only granted him interim supervised access to the Child pending the hearing of the ancillaries. He appealed against my interim access order but withdrew the appeal after grounds of decision were rendered.

5       Thereafter, the Wife filed an application to relocate the Child with her to Maryland in USA (amongst other prayers) (“**Relocation Application**”). This was contested by the Husband who applied to stay the application until the hearing of the ancillaries. Eventually, the Relocation Application together with the following contested ancillary matters came before me for hearing:

> (a)     custody, care and control of the Child (then, 6 years old);

> (b)     division of matrimonial assets;

> (c)     maintenance of the Wife and Child; and

> (d)     the Primary One school registration for the Child.

6       The Relocation Application and the issues relating to the custody care and control of the Child were heard first followed by the other contested ancillaries in July and August 2019. After considering the parties’ affidavits and submissions, I made various orders, including the following orders (in brief):

> (a)     the parties shall have joint custody of the Child, the Wife shall continue to have care and control of the Child and the Husband shall have access to the Child on certain terms. The Relocation Application was dismissed and the Child shall continue to reside in Singapore;

> (b)     the matrimonial assets be divided in the proportion of 44 (for the Wife): 56 (for the Husband), and

> (c)     the Husband shall pay maintenance for the Wife and Child.

7       The Husband appealed against my orders in relation to the division of matrimonial assets and the maintenance for the Wife and Child. The Wife did not appeal against any of my orders. I set out below my grounds of decision only in respect of the division of matrimonial assets and the maintenance ordered.

## Division of matrimonial assets

8       It was accepted in this case that the date of Interim Judgment (15 August 2018) was the operative date for determining whether an asset fell within the pool of matrimonial assets for division.

9       As for the valuation of the matrimonial assets, it was accepted that the hearing date for the ancillary matters was the operative date. However, where monies in the CPF accounts and bank accounts were concerned (the monies being the assets), the values would be the balances in these accounts at the date of Interim Judgment. In my decision, for the valuation of each matrimonial asset, I have therefore either adopted an agreed value or the available value as close as possible to the relevant operative date of the asset in question.

#### Agreed Pool of Matrimonial Assets

10     Based on the parties’ affidavits, the following assets were in the agreed pool of (disclosed) matrimonial assets for division:

> (a)     Assets in the parties’ joint names

> The only asset in joint names was the parties’ matrimonial home (“**Flat**”) at XX. This was a 3-room HDB flat which the parties had purchased in November 2013 for $344,000. On or around 3 August 2016, the Flat was selected for the Selective En Bloc Redevelopment Scheme (“**SERs**”). As such, parties were not allowed to sell the Flat in the open market and had to surrender the Flat to HDB if neither of them could retain the Flat upon divorce. At the hearing, it was agreed by both counsel that the compensation value for the Flat upon surrender was $326,700.[^1] The outstanding housing loan was confirmed to be $226,436.33 as at 25 July 2019.[^2] At the end, as the Flat was to be surrendered by the parties to HDB, the net value of the Flat was therefore taken to be **$100,263.67** (being $326,700 less $226,436.33).

> (b)     Assets in sole name of the parties

> (i)     Assets in the Wife’s sole name comprised monies in her CPF accounts and bank accounts and the balances in these accounts were accepted to be **$47,666.07** as shown below in Table A:

#### Disputed liabilities

11     The Husband claimed to have the following liabilities shown in Table C as at 18 September 2018. The Wife submitted that these liabilities should be disregarded or removed. I agreed with her submissions. I was not satisfied that the Husband had proven that these liabilities were incurred for the marriage or for the Child’s expenses. As such, I did not include any of these liabilities in determining the net value of the pool of matrimonial assets for division. I also did not have regard to the loans that the Mother had taken from her family members to fund her own legal fees for these divorce proceedings.

He should not be allowed to “double dip” by reducing the matrimonial pool and increasing his monthly expenses. The liabilities were not incurred for the marriage or for the Child’s expenses.

#### Other Disputed Claims

12     There were also other disputed claims made by the Husband. He claimed that the Wife was in possession of several items that belonged to him and his mother. He alleged that the Wife had taken away his mother’s jewellery. I did not have the jurisdiction to deal with his mother’s claims against the Wife.

13     As for his items, the Husband sought the return of his Lenovo laptop (“**Laptop**”), the **Thali** (a gold chain from his family’s ancestral jewellery that was given to the Wife when parties were married) and a diamond ring (“**Ring**”) he claimed he had bought for $2,089 as an investment for the family. I noted that the Husband had also asserted in his affidavit of assets and means that he had purchased gold jewellery (amounting to $15,000) for the family. But, he did not produce any documentary evidence to substantiate these purchases except for the Ring.

14     The Wife admitted to possession of the Ring and the Laptop. As for gold jewellery, the Wife’s position was that she had only the following items in her possession:

> (a)     a pair of gold earrings gifted by her mother for the wedding amounting to $600;

> (b)     the Thali gifted to her by the Husband (or his family) during the wedding, and

> (c)     a short gold chain gifted by her mother for the wedding.

15     The Wife produced her mother’s statutory declaration and receipts to show that her mother did purchase and gift her the said earrings and gold chain referred to in paragraph 14. As for the Ring, the Wife produced evidence to show that she had paid a sum of $1,089 for the Ring, whilst the Husband had paid the balance sum of $1,000.

16     At the end, I ordered the Wife to return the Husband his Laptop and the Thali (given the marital breakdown and divorce). As for the Ring, I included it into the matrimonial pool as parties had shared in the purchase of the Ring (see paragraph 17). I did not include the Husband’s claims of having purchased gold jewellery to the tune of $15,000 for the family as these claims were not substantiated by any documentary evidence. On the evidence adduced, I accepted the Wife’s evidence that the items of gold jewellery in her possession (apart from the Thali) were gifts from her mother and not matrimonial assets.

17     Based on the above, the net value of the pool of matrimonial assets (for division) was therefore as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="32.84%"> <col width="67.16%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Flat (Net value) nearest the ancillary matters hearing date</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$100,263.67 (agreed)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Husband’s Sole Assets</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$102,381.27</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Wife’s Sole Assets</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$49,755.07</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">[being $47,666.07 + $2,089 (value of Ring in Wife’s possession)]</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Net Value of Pool</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>$252,400 (rounded up)</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

18     I noted however that it was also the Wife’s position that the Husband had intentionally failed to disclose pertinent information relevant to these proceedings, in particular, in relation to his financial means since the date of marriage and that the Court should therefore draw an adverse inference against him. The Husband denied that he had done so and contended that these were but bare and unsubstantiated allegations by the Wife. I will touch on the parties’ evidence on this part later in my decision.

#### Structured approach in ANJ v ANK

19     For the division of matrimonial assets, both parties in their submissions adopted the structured approach set out in the Court of Appeal case of _ANJ v ANK (_2015) SGCA 34 (“**_ANJ_**_”)_. This approach in _ANJ_ was summarised in _TIT v TIU_ (2016) 3 SLR 1137 at \[21\] as follows:

> “(a)     express as a ratio the parties’ direct contributions relative to each other, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets;

> (b)     express as a second ratio the parties indirect contributions relative to each other, having regard to both financial and non-financial contributions; and

> (c)     derive the parties’ overall contributions relative to each other by taking an average of the 2 ratios above (the derived ratio shall be referred to as “the average ratio”), keeping in mind that, depending on the circumstances of each case, the direct and indirect contributions may not be accorded equal weight, and one of the two ratios may be accorded more significance than the other. Adjustments could also be made in respect of other relevant factors under s 112 or s 114(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the Charter”).”

20     I accepted that the structured approach in _ANJ_ was applicable in this case as this was a dual-income marriage. The parties had filed their affidavit of assets and means (“**AOMs**”) in October 2018. Based on the Husband’s AOM, he had been working throughout the marriage and had in fact been holding on to 2 jobs during a certain period. At the time of filing of his AOM, he was working for Company \[A\] as a senior developer in Comtel solutions earning a gross monthly income of $6,000. He had also been working as a consultant with Company \[B\] earlier (from about October 2017) but he had resigned from Company \[B\] in September 2018. His gross monthly income when he was working for Company B was $6,500. As such, he was earning a monthly gross income of about $12,500 prior to September 2018 from the 2 jobs. Based on the Wife’s AOM, she had been working throughout the marriage save for a period of about 19 months between May 2015 to January 2017. She was working initially as a research scientist at an institute in Singapore from November 2012 to April 2015 and since February 2017, she has been working as a research assistant at a local public university earning an average gross monthly income of about $3,500.

#### Parties’ positions on their contributions during the marriage

21     The parties gave very different accounts of their contributions to the marriage and the welfare of the whole family. The Husband’s evidence (in his AOM) was as follows:

> (a)     After marriage and prior to the purchase of their Flat in November 2013, parties resided in a rented HDB flat for about 22 months. The Husband paid for the rental of this flat ($2,000 per month). Together with the agent’s commission, he spent in total $46,000 as rental expenses during this period.

> (b)     On about 25 November 2013, parties completed their purchase of the Flat at a price of $344,000. He made all the initial payments including the agent’s commission for the purchase of the Flat. He paid also for the renovations. Further, only his CPF monies were used for the monthly repayments of the housing loan. The Husband alleged that the Wife had not made any financial contributions towards the Flat. She had just entered Singapore and being young and a recent graduate, she had no savings.

> (c)     Since the start of the marriage, he also supported the family and household _solely_. He bought groceries for the home and paid for all the family’s monthly expenses. When the Wife became pregnant and until the Child was born in February 2013, he also paid for all her personal, medical and delivery expenses. He had continued to do bear all the household and the family’s expenses even after the Wife found employment in November 2012. As such, she kept whatever earnings she had from her work for herself.

> (d)     When the Child was born, the Husband requested his mother to come and help take care of the Child (as the Wife was unused to taking care of infants) and his mother would take care of the Child during weekdays or when necessary. The Wife’s mother and aunt would also help take care of the Child. He was the one who had arranged and paid for their flights to Singapore (every 3 months). They would stay in the Flat and he ensured that they were well looked after. This was because he wanted the Wife to feel comfortable and supported during their marriage.

> (e)     During weekdays he sent the Child to and from the childcare and he also fed and showered the Child. On weekends, he cleaned the Flat and brought the family out for meals and entertainment. He brought the Child to the park, to play games, for shopping and also participated in her activities. He would take leave from work to be with the Child whenever necessary. He ensured that the Child’s needs were taken care of.

> (f)     He paid for the home insurance, property tax, conservancy charges, utility bills and internet and cable network bills for the Flat and he also paid for the Wife’s mobile phone bills every month. He also paid for all the furniture and fittings in the Flat amounting to about $7,250 (but he did not retain the receipts). He bought all the electronic and electrical items for the household and was the handyman at home, carrying out repairs or replacement work around the Flat whenever he could, and if it was not possible for him to do such work himself, he would engage the relevant services to rectify the problems.

> (g)     He bought jewellery for the family and some were taken by the Wife when she left the Flat in January 2018.

> (h)     He also discovered that the Wife had concealed from him that she suffered from seizures prior to their marriage. He discovered this fact when she could not take her seizure medication during her pregnancy. Notwithstanding this deception on her part, he continued to give her moral and financial support.

22     The Wife gave a detailed account (in her AOM) of her contributions to their marriage, family and home with supporting evidence. Her evidence was as follows:

> (a)     The Husband had been working in Singapore since 2008. She had been working in India from 2009 to January 2012 as a research executive after graduating in 2008 from Georgetown University, USA with a Masters in Bio-technology. Theirs was an arranged marriage in India held on 12 February 2012. They left India for Singapore 4 days later on 16 February 2012. While in Singapore, she worked as a research scientist at an institute from November 2012 to April 2015. She was then unemployed from May 2015 to January 2017 and this was because the Husband wanted her to stay at home and look after the Child and the household. However, during this period, she did take on a short tutoring job for her friend’s Primary 3 child and earned a small sum.

> (b)     The Husband had since the start of their marriage talked about buying a property in Singapore. As such, she made every effort to save for the purchase of their house and he would (since February 2012) request her to give him cash, or transfer funds to his account to put towards their savings for the house.

> (c)     They started viewing properties together from about March or April 2013. The Husband would inform her how much cash they would have to set aside if they wanted to buy a particular property. In the end, the Husband decided to buy the Flat in August 2013. A POSB mortgage bank loan was obtained in both parties’ names and as she had minimal sums in her CPF account at the time (having been employed only from November 2012), the Husband’s CPF account was used to service the monthly mortgage repayments of $1,033. The Husband also continued to request for her contributions in cash or transfers to his account. These were not in fixed amounts or made on stipulated dates as he would request for them on an ad hoc basis. However, at all times, she had believed and intended for these payments given to him as her direct contributions towards the Flat and her share of the repayments made towards the purchase of the Flat.

> (d)     As the amount disbursed for the mortgage loan was only $262,400, they were required to pay the balance via cash or the initial deduction from the Husband’s CPF. The Husband also insisted that she paid the cash over valuation of around $16,000. As he was solely in charge of all the payments, she was not sure when he actually made the required payments for the Flat. He insisted on handling the payments and told her to provide him with the cash as and when he requested for them. She also understood then that the Husband might have borrowed some monies to make the payments towards the Flat but she did not know how much was borrowed and from whom. But, on her part, she had made payments in 2013 to the Husband amounting to $29,600 via funds transfers and cash withdrawals and she had also paid $4,800 to him for the renovation works for the Flat in November 2013. In total, she had given the Husband $34,499 for their Flat by the end of December 2013. Her claims on these payments are summarised below (together with the Husband’s response):

> (e)     She had also applied for a personal loan from POSB bank (“**Personal POSB Loan**”) to contribute towards the repayments of the Flat. This was upon request of the Husband who had also separately applied for a personal loan from POSB. The monies disbursed from both of these loans were meant to be used towards the down payment for the Flat. Her loan (for $18,000) was for a term of 5 years. After deduction of processing fees and upfront interest, the sum of $13,728 was disbursed into her POSB Account \[A\] in about mid-October 2013. A monthly repayment towards this loan was deducted from her account until full repayment was made in April 2017. The disbursed amount of $13,728 was mixed with her own savings and income and eventually provided to the Husband in ad-hoc transfers / cash payments from November 2013 onwards (as shown in Table D above). The Husband was solely responsible for all the family’s financial issues and he controlled how payments were to be made towards the outstanding mortgage loan and the upkeep of the Flat.

> (f)     From the start, she had simply trusted the Husband as they were a newly married couple and she did not want to be seen as a defiant spouse. As such, she had provided him the monies (via funds transfers and by way of cash withdrawals) as and when the Husband requested for them.

> (g)     Based on her calculations from the entries in her bank statements, she also gave him further sums in 2014 and 2015 towards their savings for the Flat: (i) for 2014 and 2015, sums amounting to about $11,000 were given to him vide cash withdrawals, and (ii) for 2015, sums amounting to $5,900 were transferred into the Husband’s bank account. The Husband denied receiving any of her cash withdrawals. In respect of the funds transfers in 2015, his response was noted as follows:

> (h)     In 2014, the Husband and his mother wanted to buy a second-hand car (a red cherry QQ). She also gave the Husband a total of $3,500 _in cash_ to save for the car. She withdrew the cash on various dates as shown in her bank statements: $1,000 (12 January 2014), $1,000 (18 January 2014) and 2 withdrawals amounting to $1,500 (2 February 2014). The Husband finally bought the car sometime in April or May 2014. In his response, the Husband denied receiving any of these cash sums but admitted that he had bought the car and scrapped it subsequently.

> (i)     She had opened her own POSB Account \[A\] in early December 2012 with some cash savings and her initial salary and subsequent monthly salaries were also deposited into this account. She had started work in November 2012. The Husband did not provide her with a fixed monthly maintenance throughout the marriage and would only give her maintenance sums for herself and the Child as and when he deemed fit. Based on her calculations from these ad-hoc sums deposited by the Husband into this bank account from 2013 to 2016, his contributions for their household expenses and for the maintenance of the Child and herself ranged only between $400 per month to $600 per month. These allegations were also disputed by the Husband.

> (j)     During the period when she was unemployed (May 2015 to January 2017), she had to rely wholly on the Husband and had to ask the Husband repeatedly to transfer her funds so that she could make ends meet. Hence, in February 2017, she started working in order to be financially independent so that she could support herself and the Child. She did not want to be subjected to the Husband’s controlling and selfish nature. He was strongly against her working as he did not wish to spend money on employing a helper or putting the Child in a childcare.

> (k)     During her pregnancy, she paid for her medical check-ups and expenses (inclusive of scans, medications, vitamins and supplements) herself. After the Child’s birth in 2013, she also paid for her own medical expenses. In total, she spent $3,604 for these visits and treatments at the hospitals.

> (l)     After the Child’s birth, she had opened a POSB kids account in joint names of the Child and herself in 2013 (“**Mother- Child joint account**”), and as long as she was employed, she had set up standing instructions to transfer $700 per month into this joint account. The monies here were to be savings for the Child’s future. The Husband was aware of this, but she had to give all (if not most) of the monies in this account to the Husband. This was because, on about 13 November 2017, he had demanded that she transfer a sum of $22,000 to him for his business venture. Although she had asked him about it, he did not reveal anything to her. She had transferred this sum of $22,000 in 2 amounts to the Husband’s account: (i) $500 on 8 October 2017 (from her own account) and (ii) $21,500 on 13 November 2017 (from the Mother-Child joint account). She did not know what became of these monies or his business venture. As the Mother-Child joint account was not an online account and did not have e-statements facility, she was not able to obtain the bank statements to evidence the transfers. The Husband also kept the passbook for this account and all hardcopy statements were sent to the Flat and in the Husband’s possession. The Husband denied the Wife’s allegations on this matter and gave a different explanation for the transfers that were made to him.

> (m)     Since the Child’s birth, she was the Child’s primary caregiver. When the Child started school, she was also the one fetching the Child to and from school, not the Husband. She enrolled the Child in ballet and music lessons as the Child enjoyed these activities. She brought the Child for these lessons and she was solely responsible for the payments of all these extra-curricular activities for the Child. She paid for most of the Child’s expenses. The Husband never gave her a fixed monthly maintenance. More often than not, it was only after she repeatedly pleaded with the Husband that he would transfer the monies to her. As such, she would often pay for the Child’s expenses first, either from her salary (when she was employed) or from her savings (when she was unemployed). In 2017, she also transferred amounts totalling about $7,800 from her bank account to the Husband’s bank account.

23     In their reply affidavits, both parties disputed each other’s financial contributions towards the Flat and the family. I noted that the Husband now gave a different picture and explanation for their financial arrangements. Whilst he had received certain fund transfers from her, these were explained as returns of monies he had earlier given her for her expenditure or safekeeping (see Table D and E). And whilst he also disputed the Wife’s allegations that he had requested for her contributions for the purchase of their home or that he had requested for her to pay for the Flat’s cash over valuation and renovations, he admitted that she had taken out the Personal POSB Loan to assist in the down payment for the Flat. He agreed that each of them had taken loans to assist in the down payment of the Flat. But, he had assisted her subsequently in her monthly repayments of her loan as he had transferred monthly sums to her during the period from 2014 to 2016 for her expenses and use, and the loan was eventually paid off sometime in 2017.

24     The Husband also denied asking the Wife to transfer $22,000 to him in 2017 for a business venture. Again, his explanation was that he had from March 2017 to November 2017 given her amounts of about $1,500 to $5,000 (totalling about $23,000) for her expenditure or safe-keeping. According to him, these were either made through transfers to her account or by way of cash withdrawals given to her. In early November 2017, they had discussed and decided to repay the sum of money he had borrowed from his father. As such, he had requested that she return and transfer to him the sums he had given to her and she was therefore not out of pocket. He also denied having the POSB passbook for the Mother-Child joint account or bank statements pertaining to the same.

25     As for the Cherry QQ car, he maintained that he had paid for it fully himself. The Wife’s alleged cash withdrawals of $3,500 were not paid to him but were made for her own personal expenditure. For the Wife’s medical expenses, he showed some proof that he had paid for some of her medical expenses.

26     The Wife, in her reply affidavit, refuted the Husband’s allegations that she was not able to contribute financially towards the purchase of the Flat and its renovations. She referred to her bank statements to substantiate her evidence of her many funds transfers and cash contributions of monies to him. She also denied the Husband’s allegation that she suffered from seizures and had hidden this fact from him. This was a late and bare allegation on his part; a mere afterthought. If she had indeed such a medical condition, he would not have agreed to her having interim care and control of the Child in 2018. And, in response to the Husband’s allegations that he alone had paid for her mother’s flights to Singapore, the Wife produced evidence to show that both of them had paid for her mother’s and her aunt’s flight tickets at different times and she had also paid for the Husband’s mother’s flight ticket. As the Husband had refused to allow the Wife to enrol the Child in a childcare, the only solution was for the Wife’s mother and aunt to travel to Singapore for short durations to assist her in caring for the Child whilst she was working during the day. As such, she had made the arrangements for her mother and her aunt to come at different times and she had also taken care of their expenses whilst they were in Singapore. However, she acknowledged that the Husband’s mother had also assisted her in caring for the Child during certain periods.

27     The Wife also denied, amongst other things, the Husband’s claims that he had spent $7,250 on furniture and fittings for the Flat. In particular, she was able to produce evidence to show that she was the one who had paid $1,108 for the Flat’s air-conditioning units in March 2014 whilst he had paid the balance $1,000.

#### Direct Contributions

28     Having considered their submissions and their evidence (in particular, the supporting documents each had disclosed in these proceedings), I rejected the Husband’s case that the Wife had not made any direct contributions towards the purchase of the Flat and its renovations.

29     Whilst there were many disputed areas between the parties, it was not disputed by the Husband that he had requested the Wife to take the Personal POSB Loan in 2013 to assist in the down payment of the Flat and that the loan monies amounting to the sum of $13,728 were disbursed into her POSB Account \[A\]. There, the loan monies were co-mingled with her own monies in the account. The Wife had been working since November 2012 in Singapore and her salaries had been credited into the same account. I noted that just before the loan monies were disbursed into her account on 18 October 2013, she had an existing balance of about $9,600 and her average net monthly salary at the time in 2013 was about $3,400. At the end of October 2013, she had a balance of about $26,300. Both their bank statements proved that in November 2013, she had transferred 4 sums of $5,000 each from her account to the Husband’s bank account (POSB Account \[D\]) on 4 consecutive days (13, 14, 15 and 16 November 2013). And importantly, whilst the Husband admitted to the receipt of the first 3 sums of $5,000 on 13, 14 and 15 November 2013 (amounting to $15,000), he was silent about the 4th sum of $5,000 and did not give any explanation why it had been transferred into his account on 16 November 2013. It should be noted that the purchase of the Flat was completed about 2 weeks later on 25 November 2013.

30     On balance, having read their affidavits and having regard to the Wife’s circumstances as a young bride in an arranged marriage and living in a foreign country and having also reviewed the bank documentation disclosed by the parties during the relevant period, I believed the Wife’s evidence that she had trusted her Husband to manage their finances and that she had withdrawn cash for him and transferred monies into his account (between 2013 to 2017), as and when he had requested for the same.

31     I noted that parties had obtained their Singapore permanent residency status in early 2013. The Wife’s AOM was detailed and informed of how parties had looked for a flat together from about March / April 2013 and how she had been informed by the Husband of the various payments required for the purchase of the Flat and specifically, that he had asked her to pay for the cash over valuation (“**COV**”) of the Flat at $16,000. The Husband agreed that there was a COV of $16,000 within the purchase price of $344,000 for the Flat. I also noted that on 25 November 2013, the Husband had also paid out from his bank account a sum of $3,680 for the agent’s commission. This amount of $3,680 together with the COV of $16,000 totalled $19,680. I was satisfied on the evidence adduced that the Wife had transferred the 4 sums amounting to $20,000 into the Husband’s bank account (in November 2013) to assist in these payments that were required for the completion of the purchase of the Flat on 25 November 2013. The fact that the Wife may have been assisted in her monthly repayments of the POSB Personal Loan later on through the Husband’s financial provision of various sums (for her expenditure) did not negate the fact that she had made these initial direct contributions. The Wife was personally liable to the bank for the loan she had taken.

32     Next, I noted that the Wife had also specifically identified 2 further funds transfers amounting to $3,000 which she had made from her POSB Account \[A\] into the Husband’s same bank account on 18 November 2013 ($1,000) and 20 November 2013 ($2,000). These were requested from her by the Husband as payments towards the renovations of the Flat. The Husband admitted in his reply affidavit that these amounts were requested by him for payment towards the Flat’s “renovations/household costs”. I did not accept the Husband’s explanation (see Table D above) as to why he did not regard these transferred monies as her contributions. He appeared to be contending that what she transferred him were not her monies. He claimed that the $1,000 was a return of his funds transfer of $1,000 made to her on 17 November 2013. However, her account did not show any such funds transfer on 17 November 2013 from him. As for the $2,000 (transferred on 20 November 2013), his explanation was that these were from monies she had safe-kept as ‘savings for the family’. His entire explanation ran contrary to his original evidence in his AOM that since marriage, he had been supporting the family and household solely and that she did not have to pay for anything and that he had given monies to her for own expenditure and all her own earnings were hers to keep and apply for herself. Given the documentary evidence that the Flat’s renovation bill dated 4 November 2013 was a sum of $2,185 and she had transferred a sum of $3,000 to him in November 2013 (as requested by the Husband for the renovations), I accepted that she had paid the sum of $2,185 for the renovations.

33     In summary, I accepted that she had made direct contributions amounting to $21,865 in November 2013 towards the purchase and improvement of the Flat (being the $16,000 (for the COV) + $3,680 (for the agent’s commission) + $2,185 (for the renovations)\] from her funds transfers of $23,000 into the Husband’s bank account. As such, the balance amount paid by the Husband for the completion of the Flat’s purchase was taken as his direct contributions. This was computed as amounting to $56,500 (being the Husband’s initial cash down payment of $72,500 less the sum of $16,000 (COV) which was attributed to the Wife’s contribution). At the hearing in August 2019, the Husband’s counsel submitted that the Husband had made 2 payments on 25 November 2013 from his same bank account: (a) an initial cash down payment of $72,500 for the completion of the purchase of the Flat (vide a cashier’s order) and (b) a cash payment of $3,680 for the agent’s commission (vide another cashier’s order). These payments were confirmed by his bank statements.

34     As for all the other monies from the ad hoc transfers from the Wife’s bank account to the Husband’s bank account from 2013 to 2017 (as evidenced by their bank statements), I took them into consideration as part of the Wife’s indirect contributions for the benefit and welfare of the family (and not as direct contributions towards the Flat). These included her transfers in 2015 (Table E) and in particular, her transfer of $21,500 from her savings in the Mother-Child joint account to the Husband’s bank account.

35     For her transfers (Table E), the Husband claimed that these were returns of his transfers to her of $3,000 (January 2015) and $1,000 (5 February 2015). Again, her bank statements did not reveal any such transfers from him. As for the $21,500 that was transferred in November 2017, the Husband also tried to explain away his receipt of these funds by saying that they were returns of his monies given to her in 2017. He claimed that he had given the Wife cash sums or funds transfers during the period from March 2017 to November 2017 (amounting in total to $23,000) which were for her “expenditure / safe-keep”. I did not accept his explanation that these were not the Wife’s contributions from her monies in the Mother-Child joint account. Second, whilst he claimed that there was an agreement between the parties for these monies to be returned and transferred to him to repay monies he had borrowed from his father, he did not adduce any documentary evidence to prove the return by him of these monies to his father.

36     Having considered all the evidence, applying the approach in _ANJ_ and on a broad brush basis, I had therefore determined the direct contributions of the parties to the agreed pool of (disclosed) matrimonial assets to be as shown in the Table below. I should mention that I should have ascribed the sum of $1,000 to the Husband (as his contribution towards the Ring) and should not have ascribed the full sum of $2,089 to the Wife as her contribution. However, this adjustment should not affect the direct contribution ratio that I had determined at the end (that was rounded upwards for the Wife to 23%). It should be noted that the Wife had contributed funds amounting to $23,000 into the Husband’s bank account in November 2013 for the Flat and its renovations even though I had adopted the actual expended amounts as shown below (amounting to $21,875) during the hearing in August 2019.

#### Indirect Contributions

37     For the parties’ indirect contributions to the marriage and the welfare of the family, the Husband submitted that this should be apportioned between the parties on an equal basis, whilst the Wife contended it should be in the ratio of 10:90 in her favour. Having considered the evidence on this (both the financial and non-financial aspects) and on a broad brush basis, I was of the view that it would be fair and just to attribute to the parties a ratio of 45:55 in favour of the Wife.

38     As mentioned in paragraph 34 above, I took into consideration as part of the Wife’s indirect financial contributions to the marriage and the family, the monies she had transferred to the Husband’s bank account from 2013 to 2017 (as evidenced by their bank statements) including the sum of $21,500 transferred by her from the Mother-Child joint account in November 2017. However, I was also mindful that the Husband had provided for the Wife and the Child during the same period, as evidenced by his transactions and transfers of monies into her bank account and he had also paid for their rental expenses (in the first 2 years of their marriage) and all outgoings of their Flat subsequently. Whilst the Wife submitted extensively on the Father’s failure to provide her and the Child with a regular fixed monthly maintenance sum, I noted from a review of her bank statements that the Husband had increased his fund transfers into her account in 2015 and 2016 (when she was not working) and also in 2017 as compared to 2013 and 2014. Based on just the (i-banking) transfers alone where the Husband was clearly named as the transferor in her bank statements, I noted that these transfers totalled about $12,500 in 2015 and about $35,800 in 2016. I noted that apart from these transfers, there were also cash deposits into the Wife’s account_._ The Husband also contributed towards some of the Wife’s medical expenses and other expenses (such as those related to the Wife’s mother and aunt and his own mother being in Singapore to assist in the care of the Child).

39     As for 2017, based on the 9 months of bank statements shown in the Wife’s AOM and reply affidavit, I noted that the Husband had transferred (vide i-banking) a total sum of about $38,900 into her account. The Wife had said in her AOM that she had transferred to his account a total of about $7,800 in 2017. This was in addition to the $21,500 she had transferred to him in November 2017 (from the Mother-Child joint account). All considered, there were therefore these transfers of monies by parties into each other’s accounts from 2013 to 2017, and on her part, the Mother was clearly making indirect financial contributions for the welfare of the whole family from her own income and savings during this period.

40     On the issue of the parties’ indirect non-financial contributions, it was clear that the Wife played a more significant role (than the Husband) in the domestic sphere. She looked after the home and was the primary caregiver of the Child although she had assistance along the way from her mother and aunt, and also from his mother. The Wife also played a greater role than the Husband in providing for the Child in terms of her education and her extra-curricular activities. There was also a period when she had stopped work to care for the Child and she was also operating as a single parent during a part of this period (about 8 months in 2016) as the Husband was working in USA. There was also a period from sometime in 2017 to 2018 when the Husband worked 2 jobs and hence, he would not have been able to contribute much time at home for the family. However, some 2016 and 2017 text messages disclosed in the affidavits of the parties did show them to be communicating in a loving and warm manner and some of these messages did evidence the Husband doing his part for the family as a parent and husband.

#### Final Ratio

41     Based on the average of the proportions determined for both the direct and indirect contributions, I therefore arrived at the overall average of 61 (for the Husband): 39 (for the Wife). I did not think that there was a need on the facts of this case to adjust this ratio to give the direct contributions a greater weightage.

42     The Wife submitted that there was basis for an adverse inference to be drawn against the Husband for his failure to provide full and frank disclosure of relevant information. I agreed with her submissions. My reasons were mainly these:

> (a)     The Husband had multiple unexplained transfers and cash deposits into his POSB Account \[D\]. For August 2013 alone, he had incoming fund transfers or cash deposits amount to $42,541.50. [^3] On 3 October 2013, a cheque deposit of $19,312 was deposited into his bank account. The Wife’s counsel submitted that the Husband had not provided an explanation on the sources of these substantial funds and even if he were to argue that these sums were loans, he had also not provided any proof of the same or that he had paid back these sums. As such, she submitted that it was likely that the Husband had other bank accounts which he had not declared. At the hearing, I noted that the Husband’s counsel did not attempt to address these submissions relating to the Husband’s lack of explanation on the sources of these funds, or even attempt to seek leave for the Husband to provide an explanation or documentation to explain these sources of funds.

> (b)     The Husband also did not account for the sum of $21,500 that he admitted receipt of from the Wife in his POSB Account \[E\] in November 2017. Whilst he had claimed in his reply affidavit that it was taken to refund earlier borrowings from his father, he did not provide any supporting documentary evidence to show that the monies had been repaid from his account to the father. There was also no attempt by counsel to address this point at the hearing.

> (c)     The Husband’s salaries deposited into his bank accounts were lesser than the incomes declared in his IRAS Notices of Assessments. For work year 2015, it was submitted that his bank statements showed only salary deposits amounting to about $60,871, although the income declared to IRAS was $80,079. For work year 2017, he had declared $105,505 as his income but his bank statements only showed salary deposits amounting to about $51,341. The Husband also failed to provide his complete bank statements from October to December 2017 for his POSB Account \[D\]. No explanation was provided by him for his failure to do so, and it was submitted by the Wife’s counsel that this was possibly done to hide further funds received by him. The bank statements he had disclosed did not show the extra $54,164 declared in his IRAS tax returns. Given the above, the Wife’s counsel also submitted that the Husband had bank accounts not declared in these proceedings. The Husband’s counsel made no attempt to address these points.

> (d)     As for work year 2016, $22,381 had been declared as his income to IRAS. But, during this year, it was noted that he had worked overseas in USA from around April 2016 for about 8 months. His IRAS tax return was therefore not an accurate indication of his income earned in 2016. But, he had failed to declare his actual income earned during this period in USA in these divorce proceedings. Based on his disclosed bank statements, the Wife’s counsel submitted that his total income earned for 2016 should be about $45,961. Further, it was likely that whilst he was employed in USA, he was using another bank account to facilitate the payment of his living expenses in USA as his disclosed statements for his employment in USA did not show his daily transactions or expenses there.

Given the above, I accepted that the Husband had intentionally failed to disclose pertinent information that was relevant to these divorce proceedings. As parties have a continuing legal obligation to provide full and frank disclosure of their assets and means in these proceedings, it was appropriate to give effect to this failure on the Husband’s part by way of an uplift of 5% in the final order in favour of the Wife.

43     Given the above and adopting a broad brush approach, I was therefore of the view that on the particular facts of this case, the following final adjusted ratio of 56:44 in favour of the Husband (as set out below in Table G) represented a just and equitable division of the parties’ pool of matrimonial assets:

44     Counsel for the Wife submitted at the hearing on 5 August 2019 that the Wife was not able to retain the Flat even though she was granted care and control of the Child. As neither party was able to retain the Flat after the divorce, it was not disputed that the Flat (under SERs) was to be surrendered to HDB. Based on HDB’s latest email of 2 August 2019 (“**HDB Email**”), the Flat was to be surrendered to HDB by December 2022. It was also agreed by both counsel that upon the surrender of the Flat, the parties would be receiving from HDB the compensation sum of $326,700 (“**Compensation Sum**”). Given that the outstanding housing loan was agreed to be $226,436.33, the net value was thus taken to be $100,263.67.

#### Apportionment

45     For all the reasons set out earlier, I had therefore found the net value of the total pool of (disclosed) matrimonial assets for division to be about $252,400 (see paragraph 17). The Wife’s 44% share of this pool would amount to about $111,056 (rounded up). Taking into account her retention of the Ring valued at $2,089 and her existing sole assets of about $47,666, the balance sum she should be receiving for her 44% share would be about $61,301 (rounded up). As for the Husband, taking into account his existing sole assets of about $102,381, the balance sum he should be receiving for his 56% share would therefore be about $38,963 (rounded up).

46     Paragraph 3 of the HDB Email stated that the Compensation Sum was to be used first for the following before any balance monies remaining could be paid out to the parties:

> (a)     to pay off the outstanding housing loan for the Flat; and

> (b)     to refund parties’ respective CPF accounts, their CPF monies used for the purchase of the Flat including the accrued interest.

For the CPF refunds referred to in subparagraph (b) above, CPF documents tendered at the hearing showed that the amount of CPF refunds including accrued interest required of the Husband was already about $105,600 (as at 4 August 2019).

47     In these circumstances and having regard to the HDB requirements, I therefore made the following orders to effect the division that I had ordered of the pool of matrimonial assets:

> (1)     The Flat was to be surrendered by the parties to HDB within 3 months from the date of Final Judgment (of the divorce), and upon the surrender of the Flat to HDB, the Compensation Sum paid by HDB to the parties shall be apportioned as follows:

>> (a)       to make full payment of the outstanding housing loan for the Flat;

>> (b)       to refund parties’ respective CPF accounts, their CPF monies used for the purchase of the Flat including accrued interest, and

>> (c)       the balance compensation proceeds (if any) shall be divided in the proportion of 56 (Husband): 44 (Wife), and in the event that there was any shortfall for the CPF refunds set out in sub-paragraph (b) above, the Husband shall be solely responsible for topping up the shortfall in cash.

> (2)(a)    The Wife shall be entitled to $61,301 of the Husband’s CPF monies pursuant to s 112 of the Women’s Charter (“Ordered Amount”).

> (b)     After the making of the refunds into the Husband’s CPF account(s) of the required CPF monies from the compensation received from HDB for the surrender of the Flat to HDB, the CPF Board (“Board”) shall transfer the Ordered Amount from the monies standing to the credit of the Husband in his CPF account(s) to the Wife’s designed CPF account(s) in the following priority:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="54.2%"> <col width="45.8%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Husband’s CPF account(s) to transfer from</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Amount to transfer</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(i) Ordinary Account (“OA”)</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Ordered Amount</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(ii) In the event the monies in the OA are insufficient, Special Account (“SA”)</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Difference between Ordered Amount and the amount transferred under (i)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(iii) In the event the monies in the OA and SA are insufficient, Retirement Account (“RA”)</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Difference between the Ordered Amount and the amounts transferred under (i) and (ii)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(iv) In the event the monies in the OA, SA and RA are insufficient, Medisave</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Difference between the Ordered Amount and the amounts transferred under (i),(ii) and (iii)</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

> (c)     The Board shall only transfer the Ordered Amount after the Board has been notified of the surrender of the Flat and the refunds have been credited into the CPF account(s) of the Husband.

> (3)     This order is subject to the CPF Act and the subsidiary legislation made thereunder. The Board shall give effect to the terms of this order in accordance with the provisions of the CPF act and the subsidiary legislation made thereunder.

> (4)     The Registrar or Deputy Registrar of the Family Justice Courts under section 31 of the Family Justice Act 2014 is empowered to execute sign or indorse all necessary documents relating to matters contained in this order on behalf of either party should either party fail to do so within 7 days of written request being made to the party. Service of such notice to the Wife shall be at xxx@gmail.com whilst service of such notice to the Husband shall be at the address of the Flat.

Save as set out above in this paragraph 47 (and in paragraph 48 below which orders were not appealed against), each party was to retain all other assets that were held in their respective sole names.

48     As regards the Husband’s other claims against the Wife (see paragraphs 12 to 16 above), I ordered the Wife to return to the Husband the following items: (a) the Thali, and (b) the Laptop. The arrangements for the return were to be made between the parties’ counsel and effected within 2 weeks from the date of my order.

## Maintenance

49     It was not disputed that the Husband had not provided any monies to the Wife for the maintenance of the Child since the Wife left home with the Child in January 2018 and moved to a shelter.

50     Counsel for the Husband submitted that if the Wife was granted care and control of the Child, the Husband was prepared and willing to reimburse the Wife for 70% of the Child’s reasonable medical and educational expenses incurred from 2018 upon production of proof of these expenses. And moving forward, he was prepared and willing also to continue to pay 70% of the Child’s reasonable medical and educational expenses upon production of proof of these expenses, and in addition, he was willing also to pay a monthly sum of $300 into the Child’s bank account for her maintenance.

51     On the evidence adduced before me, I found the Child’s reasonable monthly expenses _since January 2018 to the end of July 2019_ to be in the region of about $1,620 per month (this sum consisted of the Child’s living expenses and her existing kindergarten school fees ($926.89 per month), ballet class fees (about $90 per month) and music class fees (about $130 per month). I noted that the Child’s existing kindergarten school fees and ballet and music class fees during this period totalled about $1,147 per month which was about 70% of $1,620.

52     I then considered the parties’ current income and income-earning capacities. It was not disputed by the Husband that he had been able to earn about $12,500 per month (gross) for a certain period (October 2017 to September 2018) from holding 2 jobs. But, the Husband’s evidence was that he had got his second job (the consultancy job) only because he needed monies to pay for his legal fees for the divorce and his alleged reason for resigning in September 2018 from this job was because he needed to focus on the divorce proceedings. His evidence on this was disputed by the Wife. First, she had only filed for divorce from him in 2018; parties were still together when he started working his second job in 2017. It was therefore not true that he had taken his second job only to pay his legal fees. Second, she argued that the Husband had only resigned in September 2018 so as to reduce his income because of the ancillaries in the divorce proceedings. Having heard the parties, I was not prepared to accept the Husband’s assertion that his income was only $6,000 per month (gross). On the evidence before me, I found the Husband’s earning capacity to be about $12,500 per month (gross). He was clearly capable of earning this sum and his resignation from his second job in September 2018 was a matter of choice. As for his personal expenses, I also found his claims to be exaggerated. I was of the view that his reasonable personal expenses were currently not more than $3,000 per month inclusive of all his existing liabilities (claimed at $1,360 per month) to the banks for his various credit card payments and loan repayments.

53     As for the Wife, her gross monthly salary was about $3,745 and her net salary was about $2,900 per month. I found her reasonable personal expenses to be currently in the region of about $1,000 per month (excluding any rental expenses). Given the above, I noted that the Husband’s gross monthly income (taken at $12,500) would be about 77% of the parties’ combined income (of about $16,245).

54     With the surrender of the Flat, there was a need for the Husband to obtain rental accommodation for himself. Likewise, the Wife would also have to obtain separate rental accommodation for herself and the Child. I was satisfied from the evidence adduced at the hearing that reasonable rental expenses for the Wife and the Child would be in the region of about $1,500 per month. This would be sufficient to secure a 2-room HDB unit (one bedroom and one hall) in an area located not too far from the Child’s school. As for the Husband, he should be able to obtain reasonable rental accommodation for himself alone at about $800 per month.

55     Given all the above and having considered the relative incomes and earning capacities of the parties, their reasonable monthly expenses and net disposable incomes, I therefore made the following maintenance orders for the Child:

> (a)     I was of the view that in relation to the Child’s expenses for the period from January 2018 to end of July 2019, it was fair for the Husband to contribute towards about 70% of the Child’s reasonable monthly expenses of $1,620. That being so, I ordered the Husband to reimburse the Wife the following expenses of the Child upon production of supporting documentary evidence of these existing fees: (i) kindergarten fees; (ii) music class fees and (iii) ballet class fees. I ordered the Wife to provide all documentation in support of her payments for these above expenses to the Husband within 2 weeks from the date of my order and the Husband was to reimburse the Wife in 2 equal payments, the first payment within 2 weeks from the Wife’s provision of the supporting documents, and the second payment was to be made 2 weeks thereafter. And, in the event that any invoice rendered for any of these expenses had not yet been paid by her, the Husband was to effect payment for these expenses directly to the relevant institutions.

> (b)     As for the Child’s current maintenance which was for the period commencing with effect from August 2019, I ordered the Husband to pay the Wife the sum of $1,147 per month as his 70% share of the Child’s total reasonable monthly expenses of $1,620 (which included as was mentioned earlier, the Child’s living expenses and her existing kindergarten fees and fees for her ballet and music classes). This monthly payment of $1,147 was to be made on the last day of each month with effect from 31 August 2019. I also ordered that when requested by the Husband, the Wife was to produce to him copies of the relevant receipts and invoices for the Child’s kindergarten fees, and the fees for her music and ballet classes.

> (c)     Given that the Wife and Child were required to leave the shelter upon the conclusion of the ancillary matters hearing, I also made the following additional orders as part of the Child’s maintenance:

>> (i)       that the Husband shall also pay a monthly sum of $600 to the Wife being his contribution towards the Child’s share of the rented accommodation expenses (including the utilities and other services consumed at the rented accommodation); and

>> (iii)       that this payment of $600 per month shall commence from the date the Wife moves into and resides at the rented accommodation and that it shall be payable by the Husband to the Wife on the last day of each month, and until the Wife and Child move into their rented accommodation, the Wife shall be at liberty to reside with the Child at the Flat (before its surrender to HDB), and

>> (iv)       if the Wife decides to reside at the Flat (before its surrender to HDB), she will provide the Husband with advance notice of at least 2 weeks prior to her moving into the Flat and the following terms will apply: the Husband will move out of the Flat before the Wife and Child moves into the Flat; the Child’s paternal grandmother shall be at liberty to reside in the Flat together with the Wife and the Child, and the Husband shall not enter the Flat without giving advance notice of at least 24 hours to the Wife.

56     In respect of the additional orders set out in paragraph 55 (c), based on the Husband’s income-earning capacity of $12,500 per month (gross) and taking into consideration his increased monthly expenses (that is, inclusive of his rental expenses), I was satisfied that he would have the ability to contribute $600 per month towards the Child’s share of the rented accommodation expenses. The $600 per month is computed based on the Husband bearing about (a) 70% of the Child’s half share of these accommodation expenses (being 70% of $750 = $525), and (b) a sum of about $75 to represent the Husband’s share of the Child’s share of utilities and other services consumed at the rented accommodation.

57     As for the Wife’s maintenance, on the evidence before me, there was uncertainty as to whether she would be able to secure suitable employment _immediately_ after her contract with the university ended in September 2019. However, having regard to her good qualifications and past working experience in Singapore, I did not think that she would not be able to find some employment soon. I also noted that she had in 2015/2016 taken on some private tutoring when she was looking after the Child at home. With this in mind but also taking into consideration that the Wife’s personal monthly expenses would increase by more than $1,000 (upon her moving to a rented accommodation with the Child), I was of the view that the Husband should continue to provide her with some maintenance. As such, I ordered the Husband to provide her a sum of $500 per month for her maintenance. This was to be paid on the last day of the month with effect from the last day of September 2019.

58     There was no order as to costs for the hearing of the ancillary matters.
