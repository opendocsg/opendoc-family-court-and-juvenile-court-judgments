Variation of care and control orders

8 June 2020

### District Judge Toh Wee San:

1       This is an appeal by the defendant wife (“W”) against my decision for varying the joint care orders for the child.

2       Parties were divorced around end 2016 and they entered into a consent order to jointly care for the child who was still a pre-schooler at the point of divorce. Presently the child has entered primary one. In 2019, both sides filed a summons each to vary the care arrangement of the child once she enters primary one. The plaintiff husband (“H”) applied to vary the joint care to sole care by him. W applied to retain joint care over the child but agreed to let H be the care parent on weekdays but wanted more care time from Friday afternoons to Monday mornings during school terms. They also differed on care proposals during the school holidays. I heard their applications around February 2020 and issued my orders. In short, I agreed with both of them that the child’s transition to primary one was a material change in circumstance which warranted a variation to the care order. As only W had appealed against my decision, I shall focus on my reasons for the portions of my order which did not accede to her application.

3       The legal requirement to succeed in such an application is whether there has been a material change in circumstance to justify such a variation[^1] and whether the proposed care arrangements were in the child’s best interest[^2].

4       As background, H was 43 years old and worked as a private tutor. He worked during the weekend. W was 34 years old and an executive. She worked on weekdays 11 am to 7 pm but could go off on Friday afternoons to care for the child. I provide a table under Annex 1 to summarise the original care arrangement, W’s request to change and reasons, H’s positions, my decision and reasons after applying the legal requirements.

5       I also provide a copy of my order under Annex 2.

6       As both sides have not gotten what they asked for squarely, I ordered no costs to either side.

However with the child entering Primary 1, there is a need to vary the timings of the care arrangement by each side. I was persuaded by W that she should fetch the child from school from Friday 130 pm and care for her until Sunday 7 pm, rather than Monday morning. I opined that by returning the child to H on Sunday night will allow the child to settle down, have some time to check and catch up with school work if need be, go to bed early and be more ready for school on Monday morning. H stays near the school and has a vehicle while W stays a distance away and has no vehicle. On balance, by returning the child to H the night before school starts rather than early in the morning of Monday is better for the child’s welfare.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">H brought up who should have oversight of the child’s meals, school work, washing of her uniform, school shoes, home clothes over the weekend and the manner of return of the child. W brought up the need for her to have access to the child’s books and materials in order to supervise the child. I directed that if parties could not agree, the care parent would have to oversee the child’s homework and meals. The care parent shall also have access to the child’s school books and materials in order to do so. As for the washing of the child’s home clothes, uniform and shoes, similarly the care parent have to do so or ensure that a spare set is available before the new week starts. The manner of return of the child will be decided by the care parent for the majority part of the day.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><u>School holidays in June and December</u></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Ditto.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">50% of the June and December holidays and during odd weeks.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">W argued that this was important, in view of the reduced care time during term time.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Retain the same arrangement as term time.

Since P works on weekends, he can care for the child during the earlier part of the week when he is available. W can care for the child towards the end of the week and over the weekend.

However reasonable notification and the relevant travel details are required to be furnished to the opposing side. A clarification clause was inserted into the court order.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
