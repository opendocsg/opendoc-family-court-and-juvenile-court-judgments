Ancillary Matters – Care and Control – Access – Division of Matrimonial Assets – Wife Maintenance – Children’s Maintenance

15 November 2019

### District Judge Suzanne Chin:

## Introduction

1       The husband is the Plaintiff in these proceedings (“Husband”) and the wife is the Defendant (“Wife”). The ancillary matters in the divorce proceedings between the parties first came before me on 19 June 2019. I saw the parties again on 9 July 2019 for the 2nd tranche of the hearing and on 16 August 2019, I made ancillary orders in respect of the division of matrimonial property, care and control and access to the 2 children of the marriage as well as maintenance for both the Wife and the children. (“AM orders”).

## Brief Background

2       The parties were married on xxx July 2006 and have 2 children, a boy aged 10 and a girl aged 8. On 4 April 2017, the Husband commenced divorce proceedings citing unreasonable behaviour on the part of the Wife as grounds for divorce. The Wife initially filed a defence and counterclaim in response but eventually withdrew this and agreed to proceed on an uncontested basis on the Husband’s claim. On 16 August 2017, Interim Judgement was granted on the Husband’s claim on the grounds of the Wife’s unreasonable behaviour. This was a marriage of 11 years.

3       The parties lived together from the start of the marriage. It is not clear when exactly the marriage broke down but the Husband left the matrimonial home in March 2019. The children continued to reside with the Wife in the matrimonial home. Upon the grant of the Interim Judgement, parties also came to an agreement on interim access whereby the Husband was essentially granted access to the children on 4 weekdays from 7.30pm to 9.00pm and every Saturday from 11am to 8.30am at the matrimonial flat, in the presence of the Wife.

## AM orders

4       During the hearing of the ancillary matters, I made orders granting the following:

> a.     Sole care and control of the 2 children to the Wife with liberal access to the Husband;

> b.     On the issue of division of the matrimonial pool, I ordered that the Wife should receive 46% of the total pool of approximately $425,000 as compared to the Husband’s 54%.

> c.     On the issue of the children’s maintenance, I ordered that the Husband was to pay to the Wife a sum of $470 and $500 respectively for each of the 2 children in addition to bearing the cost of their enrichment tuition and medical coverage.

> d.     On Wife maintenance, I ordered that the Wife was to receive a lump sum amount of $7,200.

5       The Wife has appealed against all of my orders and I set for below, the reasons for my decision.

## Affidavits and Evidence before the Court

6       For the ancillary matters, the Husband filed two affidavits:

> a.     1st Affidavit of Assets and Means (“1st AOM”) dated 17 October 2017; and

> b.     2nd Affidavit of Assets and Means (“2nd AOM”) dated 14 June 2019.

> The Wife on the other hand had filed only one affidavit for the ancillary matters – her 1st AOM dated 20th October 2017. I set forth below a brief account of the sequence of events which led to this.

7       After the filing of the 1st AOM by each party, the parties went through a protracted discovery process of close to one and a half years. Both parties were represented by counsel at the time. Parties were then directed by the Court to file and exchange their 2nd AOM’s by 28 February 2019. The Court was informed by the Husband’s counsel that his 2nd AOM was ready for filing, but through counsel, the Court learned that the Wife’s 2nd AOM was still not ready to be filed. Further extensions of time were granted to the Wife for the filing of her 2nd AOM with a final deadline of 3 April 2019. The Wife once again failed to meet this deadline.

8       Shortly thereafter, the Wife’s counsel filed a summons for discharge and during the case conference of the 17 April 2019, the Court made an order allowing the Wife’s counsel to discharge themselves. The Wife eventually filed a summons for an extension of time to file her 2nd AOM. This summons was heard on 12 June 2019 and her application for a further extension of time was dismissed. The Wife did not appeal against this decision and the matter proceeded to hearing of the Ancillary Matters.

## Care and control and access

9       During the hearing, the Husband contended that the care and control of the children should be granted to him instead of the Wife or alternatively that there should be an order for shared care and control made with the children spending 3.5 days of a week with each party. While he conceded that the children had been residing with the Wife since he left the matrimonial home in March 2017, he contended that she was making his access difficult and cited examples of her hindering his access to the children. Some of these included sending the children to other places during his access times, rearranging the children’s enrichment classes so that they clashed with his access times, conducting her yoga classes and involving the children in her yoga classes during his access times at the matrimonial home, taking the children out and returning late for his access[^1]. The Wife denied that she was trying to curtail his access and explained to the Court that she had been acting in the best interests of the children at all times. She also claimed that it was the children who wanted her to make all of the arrangements and she was merely acceding the childrens’ requests. She wanted care and control of the children to remain with her and asked that the Husband only be granted supervised access. In this regard, she contended that the Husband had on 2 recent occasions inflicted family violence on their son. She informed the Court that she had applied for personal protection orders (“PPO”) for both children against the Husband. She also did not agree to the weekday access as during his access times, the Husband had not made the children study or do their homework as had been agreed.

10     While I considered each parties position on the above, I did not find that the Wife had actually prevented the Husband from having access to the children. I accepted his assertions that she was making things difficult for him but the reality was that he still saw the children on a regular basis. The difficulty appeared to be that the access was taking place at the matrimonial home in the presence of the Wife as well as the Wife not understanding that she was not at liberty to modify court ordered access as she pleased. During the hearing, I explained to the Wife the importance of a court order being strictly complied with without the unilateral modification of the terms. Notwithstanding, I did not think that this was sufficient reason for a reversal of care and control, given that the Husband was happy to leave the children with the Wife when he left the matrimonial home more than 2 years ago. I also found that it would be in the best interests of the children for the status quo to be preserved. Considering the level of acrimony that continued between the parties, I was also not convinced that an order of shared care and control would be in the best interests of the children. Accordingly, I granted sole care and control of the two children to the Wife.

11     On the issue of access, I allowed the Wife to tender further evidence relating to the instances of violence she had referred to and in this regard, she submitted police reports and medical reports. I examined all of the evidence before me and took into consideration the fact that the Wife’s PPO applications for the benefit of the children had been dismissed after hearing. It is also worth noting that during the first ancillary matters hearing which took place before the PPO trial, the Wife informed the Court that the Husband had had unsupervised access with the children at the playground on Saturday afternoons when he would take the children out on his own. This included the most recent Saturday just before the ancillary matters hearing. Taking all of this into consideration, I did not see any need for access by the Husband to take place on a supervised basis. As the structure of interim access that parties had agreed to seemed to work on a broad level, I made similar orders. This essentially granted to the Husband liberal access to the children as I was of the view that it would be in their best interests to be allowed as much as possible to spend uninterrupted time with their Father.

## Division of the Matrimonial Assets

## The Matrimonial pool

12     On the issue of division of the matrimonial assets, the Husband initially had asked for the matrimonial flat to be sold and after refund of all CPF monies for the balance to be divided between the parties. Subsequently during the hearing, he asked for the first option to purchase the flat if this were to be allowed by HDB. The Wife on the other hand was asking for the entire matrimonial flat to be transferred to her with the current outstanding loan of $358,983 fully paid by the Husband. In addition, she wanted additional amounts of cash to be provided to her including reimbursement for the setting up of her yoga business and repayment of the renovation loan.

13     I first set out to determine the assets that fell within the matrimonial pool. The parties agreed that the following assets fell within the matrimonial pool:

> (a)     The matrimonial flat which was an Housing Development Board Flat;

> (b)     A joint bank account in the joint names of the parties;

> (c)     Monies in bank accounts, CPF monies and insurance policies held in the Wife’s name; and

> (d)     Monies in bank accounts, CPF monies, insurance policies, shares/unit trust and land in India held in the Husband’s name.

The values of all of these were undisputed save for the monies in the Wife’s bank accounts and the land in India held in the Husband’s name. I will deal with each of these below.

14     I would also mention that the Husband referred to the Wife’s yoga business as well as interests she held in property in India. He asserted that in respect of these, the Wife had not made full and frank disclosure and accordingly he was not able to attribute a value to these assets. He was however asking that the Court to draw an adverse inference against her. Likewise, the Wife claimed that the Husband had other assets which he had failed to disclose and she too wanted the Court to draw an adverse inference against him for his lack of full and frank disclosure. I will deal with the issue of adverse inference below.

#### The Wife’s bank accounts

15     The Wife tendered her bank statements for June 2019 which reflected a balance of $1,247. In this regard, the Husband’s counsel drew the Court’s attention to a withdrawal made on 10 June 2019 which the Wife had annotated in handwriting as being repayment to her sister-in-law for moneys borrowed[^2]. The Husband requested that this amount be added back into the bank account, as the Wife had produced no evidence to support her position. I agreed with the Husband in this regard and bearing in mind the lack of any evidence produced by the Wife, determined that the value of monies standing in the Wife’s bank accounts stood at $4,246.

#### Property in Husband’s name in India (“Indian Property”)

16     The Husband initially informed the Court that there was no market value to the Indian Property. He explained that he had paid a sum of $72,000 for the property and the current outstanding mortgage stood at $19,000 and accordingly wanted a value of $72,000 to be ascribed to the Indian Property. The Wife disputed this value and contended that value should be higher. In this regard, she claimed that the market value of the Indian Property should be in the region of $113,000 but provided no evidence to support her contention. In the circumstances, I directed the Husband to provide to the Court with documents showing the current value of the Indian Property. The Husband complied with this direction and provided information on the last transacted price for a similar property[^3]. Based on this, I determined that a value of $115,671 for the Indian Property. Taking into account the outstanding mortgage of $19,000, which was not disputed, I attributed a value of $96,971 to the Indian Property.

17     The table below sets out the assets within the matrimonial pool and their values:

## The legal principles on division of matrimonial property

18     Having determined the matrimonial pool and its value, I proceeded with the next step of division of the pool. At this stage, the Court is tasked with the duty to divide matrimonial assets in accordance with Section 112(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) which requires such division to take place “in such proportion as the Court thinks just and equitable.”

19     The Court of Appeal in _ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span> first set out the structured approach for the division of assets. In the recent case of _UYP v UYQ_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHCF 16</span>, the Learned Judge Debbie Ong summarised this as follows:

> “Under this approach, the Court will, in the first step, ascribe a ratio that represents each party’s direct financial contributions towards the acquisition of the MAs, relative to that of the other party. In the second step, the Court will ascribe a second ratio to represent each party’s indirect contribution to the well-being of the family, relative to that of the other party. The Court then derives each party’s average percentage contribution to the marriage. Further adjustments to this average ratio may be made after taking into account the other factors enumerated in s 112(2) of the Women’s Charter as well as all relevant circumstances to arrive at a just and equitable division of the MAs: see _ANJ v ANK_ at \[22\].”

## Direct Contributions

20     Applying the structured approach, I sought to determine each spouse’s direct contributions to the jointly owned matrimonial assets as well as the assets contributed to by both parties

#### Matrimonial property

21     The matrimonial property was a Housing Development Board Flat jointly owned by the parties. Apart from monies withdrawn from each parties’ respective CPF accounts, which were undisputed, the parties had made various contributions in cash. Parties were in agreement as to their contributions for parts of the cash contributed towards the property but disputed the amounts that had been paid towards the renovation loan of $12,000 as well as the cash amount of $17,480.

22     With regard to the cash amount for the renovation loan, the Wife claimed that notwithstanding that the monies for payment of the loan came from the joint account, an amount of $9,980 had come from her account[^4]. Upon examination of the evidence, I accepted the Wife’s position and attributed a sum of $9,980 to her and $2,120 to the Husband. For the sum of $17,480, the Husband informed the Court that these related to lines of credit and while the Husband contended that he paid for the majority of this, the Wife insisted that she had paid half of it. In the absence of evidence provided by either party, I attributed this equally between the parties. Taking all of the parties’ contributions into consideration, I determined that the Husband had contributed 51% while the Wife had contributed 49%.

#### Indian Property in Husband’s name

23     The Wife contended that she had paid entirely for the Indian Property acquired in 2012. In this regard, she claimed that the Husband had taken out a sum of $54,202 from her bank account and used this for the purchase of the Indian Property. The Husband did not deny that he had transferred these amounts into his bank account in India but his position was that these were transferred for various investments that the parties were making in India and not just for the Indian Property. He also explained that he had paid her back for the amounts that had been transferred[^5].

24     It was not disputed that the property was purchased for $72,000 and that there was still an outstanding amount of $19,000. As such, the amount paid to date was approximately $53,000. I examined the evidence before me. Upon hearing the Husband’s counsel state this position, the Wife claimed at the hearing that she had paid a sum of about $53,000 and had paid entirely for the Indian property. Her position in her affidavit was however inconsistent with her assertions at the hearing. In her 1st AOM dated 20 October 2017, she had stated that she had been forced by the Husband to pay $71,000 for the purchase of a property in his sole name. Considering the inconsistency in her evidence, I did not find that she had satisfactorily proven that she had paid for the entire property.

25     The underlying premise that marriage is a joint cooperation between the parties is encapsulated in s46 of the Women’s Charter where it is stated that husband and wife “shall be mutually bound to co-operate with each other in safeguarding the interests of the union….”. In the present case, the Indian Property was purchased in 2012, long before the break down of the marriage and at a time when parties were “mutually bound to cooperate with each other” in building assets for the family. I had also noted from the evidence that the parties had through the years jointly contributed to various other investments together. Taking all of the above into consideration and adopting a broad brush approach, I arrived at the conclusion that it would be just and equitable to take a position that the parties had contributed equally towards the Indian Property.

## Direct Contributions towards the Matrimonial Pool

26     Taking each parties contributions towards the matrimonial home and Indian Property and factoring the assets held by each party in their own names as well as attributing half of the value of the joint bank account to each party (this was consented to by the parties), I determined that the Husband had made direct contributions of 64% towards the total matrimonial asset pool while the Husband had made direct contributions of 36%.

## Indirect Contributions

27     I now turn to the indirect contributions.

28     The Husband maintained that a ratio of 50:50 for indirect contributions should be applied as parties had both been involved in the indirect contributions of during the marriage. He asserted that both had contributed financially and non financially. He also explained that save for a period of one year, parties had always had the help of a domestic helper. The Wife argued that an appropriate ratio for indirect contributions was 75:25 in her favour. It was her position that she had contributed financially to the household expenses even when she had not worked as she had used her savings. She also claimed that she had paid for all medical expenses as well as household expenses. With regard to the indirect financial contributions, she claimed that she had been the one who had taken care of all of the children’s needs and that the Husband had not been an involved father and had often disappeared because of his alcoholism.

29     This was a marriage of 11 years. From the start of the marriage, it appears that both parties worked and had the assistance of a domestic helper except for 2014 when they had no domestic helper. The Wife stopped working at the end of 2015 and only started her yoga business sometime in 2017. Taking into account each parties’ submission as well as the totality of the evidence before me, I was of the view that both parties had made their fair share of indirect contributions to the marriage, both financial and non-financial. I did not accept that the Wife had contributed more than the Husband in terms of indirect financial contributions. The Wife claimed that the Husband had misappropriated her monies from her bank account yet she says she had paid for everything. Taking into consideration her position that her monthly take home salary before she stopped working was $3,700, I found it difficult to accept that she had been able to pay for the bulk of all expenses and at the same time set aside fairly substantial sums which she claims had been used to pay for various investments as well as the land in India which was in the Husband’s name. It was more likely that both parties had contributed towards the expenses for the family as well as the building up of investments including the land in India. It was also clear and undisputed that since the interim maintenance order was made in 2017, the Husband had been paying for the ordered amounts to the Wife, save for some amounts relating to enrichment classes which parties had not agreed to.

30     With regard to the indirect financial contributions, I also did not accept that the Father was an uninvolved Father. Just taking into consideration the consent orders on access and the Wife’s own evidence that he was supposed to make sure the children did their homework, I arrived at the conclusion that the Husband had probably been quite actively involved in the children’s education. If indeed he had not done any of this, it would be unlikely for the Wife to have wanted the Husband to help the children with their homework during his access times.

31     Taking all of the above into consideration as well as the length of the marriage and adopting a broad brush approach, on the facts of this case, I considered that it would be appropriate and fair for a ratio of 40:60 in favour of the Wife to be applied for indirect contributions.

## Average Ratio

32     Both parties agreed that the average ratio should be applied and after using the direct and indirect contribution ratios I had determined earlier, I arrived at a division of 52% to the Husband and 48% to the Wife.

## Adverse Inference and Adjustments

33     As mentioned earlier, both parties wished to have an adverse inference drawn against the other.

#### The law on adverse inference

34     The High Court in **_TIT v TIU_** **<span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHCF 8</span>** noted as follows:

> “\[31\] As noted by the Court of Appeal in _BG v BF_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 3 SLR(R) 233</span> (“_BG v BF_”), at \[52\], the general duty owed by parties to the Court to “make full and frank disclosure of all relevant information within his or her knowledge \[,\] is particularly relevant in the context of the division of matrimonial assets.” The absence of full and frank disclosure would entitle the Court to draw a suitable adverse inference.”

35     In **_Chan Tin Sun v Fong Quay Sim_** **<span class="citation">\[2015\] 2 SLR 195</span>**, the Court of Appeal at \[62\] referred to the decision of _Koh Bee Choo v Choo Chai Huah_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] SGCA 21</span> on drawing of adverse inferences:

> “In order for the Court to draw an adverse inference, there must be:

>> (a)    a substratum of evidence that establishes a prima facie case against the person against whom the inference is to be drawn; and

>> (b)    that person must have had some particular access to the information he is said to be hiding.”

> The Court of Appeal set forth 2 alternative approaches in giving effect to the adverse inference:

>> (1)    to make a finding of the value of the undisclosed assets on the available evidence and to include this in the matrimonial pool for division (for example, the Singapore High Court decision of _Tay Sin Tor v Tay Chay Eng_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 2 SLR(R) 385</span> at \[18\]); or

>> (2)    to avoid unnecessary speculation with respect to the specific values of undeclared assets to order a higher proportion of the known assets to be given to the party requesting for the adverse inference to be drawn.

#### Adverse Inference against the Wife

36     In the present case, the Husband contended that the Wife had not made full and frank disclosure of all of her assets. In particular, he argued that the Wife had not provided information on three of her assets: (1) her yoga business and (2) her interests in two properties in India.

37     While the Wife did not deny the existence of her yoga business, she was adamant that she was under no obligation to provide any information on her yoga business to either of the Husband or to the Court. Contrary to the Wife’s views, her yoga business is an asset that she holds and for the purposes of the determination of an ancillary matters hearing, each party is obligated to provide full and frank disclosure of all of their assets.

38     With regard to her properties in India, the Wife tendered certain email exchanges she had with various parties in India to indicate that she did not have any ownership in properties. While I accepted that no properties existed at this point in time, it was clear that the Wife had an interest of some sort and had not provided any details of this to the Court. Taking into consideration all of this, I accepted that the Husband had made out a prima facie case against her and determined that an adverse inference should be drawn against her.

#### Adverse inference against the Husband:

39     The Wife wanted an adverse inference to be drawn against the Husband. She informed the Court that he had misappropriated sums of money from her account as he had had full control of her bank accounts from the start of the marriage. In this regard, she appeared to change her position several times about the amount in question saying that he had misappropriated between $100,000 to $120,000 from her POSB account between 2006 and 2013 and she wanted him to account for this. She also referred to various 2016 bank statements alleging that he had made transfers from his bank account to another bank account in his name and based on this, she took the position that he had not made full and frank disclosure. Upon examination, I did not find that the evidence supported the Wife’s allegations on either contention.

40     With regard to the alleged misappropriation of monies from 2006 to 2013, firstly it is worth noting that at the same time as she asserts that the Husband had misappropriated monies from her throughout the marriage, the Wife also contends that that money was used to purchase the Indian Property. I had previously accepted that she had made some contributions towards the Indian Property and had taken into account her contributions in arriving at the ratio for each parties’ direct contributions towards this Indian property. If I were to accept her request to have the Husband account for these monies, the Husband would be penalised for double counting of these amounts. I also noted that these transfers took place at a time before the break down of the marriage when parties were supposedly jointly cooperating for the union’s interest. Secondly, the parties must understand that in determining how matrimonial property is to be divided in a just and equitable manner, the Court adopts a broad brush approach and is not tasked to microscopically go through the parties’ financial arrangements throughout the entire marriage to claw back monies paid by one to the other.

41     I also noted that through her appointed counsel at the time, the Wife had filed an application for discovery and interrogatories. Notwithstanding, both of these issues were never raised and the Wife had made no request to the Husband for the production of these documents in relation thereto. Accordingly, I did not agree that the Husband had failed to make the requisite full and frank disclosure which would warrant the drawing of an adverse inference. For all of the above reasons, I did not find that the Wife had established the requisite prima facie case to allow the Court to draw an adverse inference against the Husband.

#### Final Adjustments

42     Based on the above and taking into account all facts and circumstances of the case and drawing an adverse inference against the Wife, I determined that it would be just and equitable for the matrimonial assets to be divided in the proportion of 46% to the Wife and 54% to the Husband.

## Maintenance for the children

43     The Wife requested for a monthly sum of $2,500 as maintenance for both children. The Husband was not agreeable to this and instead wanted to continue to pay the interim amount of $500 as per the interim maintenance orders. In addition to this, he also paid for all school fees and enrichment classes (ie abacus, dance, music, piano, swimming, drawing and mother tongue.), the cost of mortgage, utilities, conservancy charges, town council fees, cable television and internet charges; as well as the children’s year end expenses and maintained medical insurance coverage for the children.

44     The Wife claimed that the children’s expenses amounted to $2,826 and $1,466 respectively. The Husband disputed this and maintained that the reasonable expenses of the children only amounted to $1,001.50 and $881.5 respectively. Set forth is a table of the children’s expenses with each parties position as submitted and the Court’s final determination:

45     Having determined the reasonable expenses for each of the children, I turned to determine the ratio in which parties were to share these expenses. In this regard, after assessment of the evidence before me, I found that the Husband earned a take home amount of approximately $5,320 monthly. The Wife had stopped working in 2015 and decided to start a yoga business in 2017. She claimed that she was earning only between $600 to $800 but informed the Court that her last earned salary was $3,700. In light of this, I determined that it would be just and reasonable for children’s expenses to be shared such that the Husband will bear 70% and the Wife 30%.

46     Taking into consideration the fact that the Husband will be paying for medical insurance and enrichment classes for the children directly, I ordered that in addition to this, the Husband was to pay a monthly sum of $470 for the 1st child and $500 for the 2nd child.

## Wife Maintenance

47     The Wife was asking for maintenance of $2,000 to be paid to her for the next 10 years or a lump sum amount of $132,000 for herself. The Husband maintained that there should be no wife maintenance as the Wife is more than able to support herself.

48     The Wife claimed total monthly expenses of $2,950 and annual expenses of $1,657. I note that parties had agreed to an interim wife maintenance amount of $600 but at the time, the Husband was to bear the mortgage payments.

49     The Law is trite in this area of Wife maintenance. In **_Foo Ah Yan v Chiam Heng Chow_** **<span class="citation">\[2012\] SGCA 15</span>**, the Court of Appeal also held that:

> “\[26\] As the power to order maintenance is supplementary to the power to order division of matrimonial assets, Courts regularly take into account each party’s share of the matrimonial assets when assessing the appropriate quantum to be ordered: see, for example, _BG v BF_ (\[15\]) _supra_) at \[75\] - \[76\], _Rosaline Singh_ (\[18\]) _supra_) at \[13\]; _Tan Bee Giok_ at \[27\] and _AQS_ (\[19\]) _supra_) at \[51\]). Indeed, this inquiry falls within the matters to be considered under s 114(1)(a) of the Act…”

In _TNL v TNK and another appeal and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 15</span>, the Court of Appeal at \[63\]: Page 31 of 99

> “\[63\] Additionally, as noted by the Judge, the Court’s power to order maintenance is _supplementary_ to its power to order a division of matrimonial assets (_ATE v ATD_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGCA 2</span> at \[33\]). Consequently, if, from the division of matrimonial assets, there is a sum which, if invested properly, would be sufficient to maintain the wife, the award of maintenance should be no more than what is necessary to allow the wife to, in the words of the Judge, “weather the transition of the divorce” …”

50     The Wife is currently not employed but is instead running her own business which may not provide her with the income she is capable of earning. That is however her choice. Taking into consideration the Wife’s earning capacity as well as her current salary and what I considered to be her reasonable expenses, I determined that she should have enough to cover her own expenses if she finds employment. Bearing in mind my decision on the division of matrimonial assets, I was of the view that financial inequalities had indeed been evened out but taking into account her circumstances and the fact that she has not been employed since 2015, I arrived at the conclusion that the Wife should receive some assistance to help her get back onto her feet. Accordingly, I ordered that a lump sum amount of $7,200 calculated at a monthly sum of $600 over 12 months be paid to the Wife.
