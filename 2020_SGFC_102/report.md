Ancillary Matters – Access – Shared Care and Control of young children

10 December 2020

### District Judge Geraldine Kang:

## Brief Background

1       For ease of reference, parties shall be referred to Husband and Wife in this written grounds of decision. The Husband is a 30-year old Singaporean whereas the Wife is a 28-year old Indian national with Permanent Residency in Singapore.

2       Briefly, parties were married sometime in December 2015 and have one son borne to their union in 2017. At the time of the hearing before me, the child was about 3 years old. Interim Judgement was granted sometime in June 2019 on the basis of the respective claims and counterclaims of unreasonable behaviour.

3       When the child was approximately 3 months old, the Wife moved out of the matrimonial flat with the child sometime in September 2017; the Husband continued to reside in the matrimonial flat and continues to do so as the flat was purchased in his sole name. After the Wife had unilaterally removed the child from the matrimonial home without the Husband’s consent, the Husband took out an interim summons application for care and control as well as access to the child; the Wife cross applied for custody of the child. Orders were made for parties to have joint custody and for the Wife to have sole care and control of the child. In addition, interim weekly access was granted to the Husband from 10am to 5pm every Saturday (“**OSG Orders**”).

4       There was also a prior order for maintenance for the Husband to pay $200 per month for the child as well as to supply the child’s monthly milk powder and other child’s necessities i.e. child’s food, diapers, toiletries, clothing etc.

5       After leaving the matrimonial flat, the Wife and child moved into her aunt’s flat where they continue to reside at present. The living conditions were as such – the aunt was married with 3 adult children living with them as well in the same flat, although the Wife and son had their own room. In summary, the aunt and uncle essentially took on the role of “maternal grandparents” to the child as the Wife did not have any other relatives in Singapore. The child was enrolled in a full-day childcare centre within the vicinity of the aunt’s residence; and whilst the Wife was at work, the aunt and uncle would assist with the caregiving arrangements of the child, which included picking the child up from the childcare centre, attending to the child’s needs and meals. Both the aunt and uncle had filed affidavits to attest to their role and involvement in the child’s daily routine – emotionally and financially.

6       At the ancillary hearing before me, all issues were contested. Having heard their respective submissions, a summary of the ancillary orders made by myself is as follows:

> (a)     Joint custody of the child of the marriage, with care and control to the Wife.

> (b)     The Husband shall have weekly access to the child from Friday to Sunday 12pm. The Husband and/or his parents shall be at liberty to pick up the child from the child’s current school on Fridays and to return the child to the Wife’s residence by Sunday 12pm.

> (c)     Each party to retain all assets held in their sole names.

> (d)     With effect from 15 April 2020 and thereafter on the 15th day of each month, the Husband shall pay into the Wife’s designated bank account:

> (e)     $200 per month as the Wife’s monthly maintenance

> (f)     $600 per month as the child’s monthly maintenance

> (g)     In addition, the Husband shall reimburse the Wife for all medical expenses of the child incurred via the usage of his CSC medical benefits. In the event that the CSC medical benefits are insufficient, the Plaintiff shall within 7 days reimburse the Wife 50% of the child’s medical expenses upon the Wife producing the relevant receipts.

> (h)     No orders as to costs.

> (i)     Liberty to apply.

7       The Wife is now appealing against only Paragraph 2 of my decision which relates to the access to the child which I granted to the Husband. For completeness, I would add that prior to filing the appeal, the Wife had sought to make further arguments on the following grounds:

> (a)     As a full-time working mother, she would not have any time on the weekends with the child;

> (b)     Overnight access was inappropriate as the child had never spent a night away from the Wife since birth;

> (c)     There was a lack of transparency over the Husband’s working hours and the caregiving arrangements should not be left or delegated to his parents should he be absent or away from Singapore. (ie. Access was to be granted to a parent only and not grandparents.)

I declined to the request to make further arguments and directed that the orders made were to stand.

8       As this was a partial appeal only against the access orders I made, I will focus only on this aspect of my decision and now set out my reasons.

## The Wife’s Position

9       At the start of the marriage, the Wife was a homemaker and did not work. Subsequently, during the course of the divorce proceedings, the Wife sought and attained gainful employment sometime in February 2019; and at the time of the hearing before me, she was working full time as clinic assistant from Mondays to Fridays from 8.30am to 5pm and Saturdays 8.30am to 1pm (with alternate Tuesday and Friday afternoons off).

10     The Wife urged the Court to consider the status quo in so far as the child’s caregiving arrangements which had been in place since September 2017, when the child was approximately 3 months and until the OSG Orders were made.

11     She cast aspersions on the Husband’s parenting ability and level of involvement due to the nature of his work which she alleged would require him to travel overseas and it would not be in the child’s best interest to be cared for by other third parties who were never actively involved in the child’s life. She also alleged that the home environment was not a conducive one due to his parents’ behaviour for instance, she claimed that during the course of the marriage, they have verbally abused her such that she had no alternative but to leave the matrimonial home.

12     She also alleged that in seeking a shared care and control order of the child, the Husband’s intentions were less than noble – instead it was for the purpose of forming a nucleus which would allow him to retain the matrimonial flat in his sole name without any division of it (which the Wife was seeking).

## The Husband’s Position

13     At the ancillary hearing before me, the Husband had prayed for joint custody of the child and that care and control be granted to him, or in the alternative, shared care and control of the child. It was his case that unlike the Wife who had no immediate family in Singapore, he had to support of his parents to assist in the caregiving arrangements of the child. The lack of familial relations nor kinship between the child and the Wife’s aunt would not be in the child’s best interest to continue residing with them. He argued that the child’s present living conditions were congested; whereas he would have the space in his own HDB flat to provide for the child. Further, the Husband also argued that as a foreigner, the Wife was not able to provide the child with proper guidance in respect of the educational and development in Singapore.

14     The Husband is employed as a radar technician with the Singapore Armed Forces. As the Husband was seeking shared cared and control of the child, he had adduced support from his employers in relation to his flexible working hours; which would bolster and facilitate in his caregiving arrangements for his child. Pursuant to the Court’s directions, he further elaborated on the supportive role that his mother (ie. The child’s paternal grandmother) would have in relation to the child.

15     In the event that the Court was not minded to grant care and control of the child to him, he prayed for shared care and control in the alternative – with the child staying with him 4 days a week and the remaining 3 days of the week with the Wife. This would also allow the Child to bond with both parents. The Husband took pains to highlight the Wife and/or her aunt were misleading various people in authority such as police officers, the child’s school administration and that such behaviour was not only selfish but further showed a complete disregard for him as the child’s Father and an unwillingness to co-parent in the child’s interests.

16     The Husband was at pains to emphasise that the Wife was using the child as a pawn and obstructed access out of malice towards the Husband and his family. Such alienation was not healthy for the child.

## Child’s Interests – The Law

17     It is trite law that Section 125 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353) was the applicable law when the court has to make orders for the welfare of children in situations of marital breakdown. The case authorities in this area are often cited and continue to evolve.

18     The seminal decision of the Court of Appeal in **_CX v CY (minor: custody and access)_** **<span class="citation">\[2005\] 3 SLR(R) 690</span>** explains the concepts of “custody” and “care and control” (at \[31\]):

>     … where parties are splitting up, custody as a general concept is divided into two smaller packages, _ie_, ‘care and control’ and residual ‘custody’. … \[R\]esidual ‘custody’ is the package of residual rights that remains after the grant of a care and control order that dictates which parent shall be the daily caregiver of the child and with whom the child shall live. To put it simplistically, ‘care and control’ concerns day-to-day decision-making, while residual ‘custody’ concerns the long-term decision-making for the welfare of the child.

19     “Custody” thus pertains to decision-making over the major aspects of a child’s life, such as the child’s education and major healthcare issues. Where joint or no custody orders are made, both parents must consult each other and co-operate to make the major decisions for the child. Such orders ensure that the child continues, even after the parent’s divorce, to have the guidance of both parents in his or her life.

20     “Care and control”, on the other hand, relates to which parent the child should live with primarily, with that parent as the daily caregiver. Consequently, that parent is generally responsible for making day-to-day decisions for the child, such as how the child is to dress or what the child is to eat. In most cases, the child will also spend regular periods of time with the other parent through an arrangement known as “access”. Access can take many forms. Where the child is not yet completely comfortable spending time alone with that parent, access may be supervised by professionals such as counsellors who will also assist in strengthening the parent-child relationship. Access may also be overnight, where for example, the child stays at the residence of that parent for one or some nights a week. When the parent with access is with the child, he or she can make some of the day-to-day decisions for the child, as it would be otherwise impractical for the parent with care and control to be consulted on every decision, such as what the child should eat during periods of access.

21     In **_TAU v TAT <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHCF 11</span>_**, Justice Debbie Ong embarked on an insightful discussion on shared care and control orders. Such orders are not common but there is a place indeed for such orders; and every case is to be determined on its own facts and merits.

>      **_Shared care and control_**

> \[11\]  It is common that a parent is granted sole care and control of a child while the other parent has access to the child. **In appropriate cases, the court may grant both parents shared care and control if this is feasible and determined to best serve the child’s welfare.** In such cases, the child may spend about three days of the week with a parent and the remaining four days with the other parent. **Each parent will be responsible for day-to-day decision-making for the child when the child is living with him or her.** The child will effectively have two homes and two primary caregivers in this arrangement: _AQL v AQM_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 840</span> at \[8\]. To be clear, shared care and control is different from joint custody; the former relates to the child living with both parents, while the latter is about joint decision-making over major decisions affecting the child.

> \[12\]  As I have explained above, the legal constructs of custody, care and control, and access are used to support families where the child’s parents have separated. Intact, functioning families do not need such interventions. The ideal state is understandably for a child to be in an intact family where he or she lives with and is lovingly cared for jointly by both parents. Yet, upon the breakdown of a marriage, this is simply no longer fully achievable. The family justice system nevertheless aspires to achieve the ideal state of affairs for the child, or the closest to it possible. But to ignore the realities, including the parental conflict, the parties’ emotional baggage and the new dynamics of the various relationships, and impose in all situations a modified version of the perceived ideal (such as equal-time shared parenting or shared care and control) can do more harm than good. **Thus in considering whether shared care and control would be in the child’s welfare, the court will have to consider factors such as that particular child’s needs at that stage of life, the extent to which the parents are able to co-operate within such an arrangement, and whether it is easy for that child, bearing in mind his or her age and personality, to live in two homes within one week.**

>      **…**

> \[20\]   **There is thus neither any legal principle against shared care and control, nor a legal presumption that this arrangement is always in a child’s welfare. Where such an arrangement is suitable for a child in his or her developmental stage of life, considering his or her relationship with each parent and all relevant circumstances, such an order may be made for the child’s welfare.** Whatever the arrangements ultimately made, parents must recognise that they must “place the needs of their children before their own”: _TAA v TAB_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 2 SLR 879</span> at \[18\].

**\[my emphasis added\]**

22     Justice Ong declined to make an order for shared care and control for the 4-year old child in question.

## Conclusion - My orders

23     On the facts, I awarded care and control of the child to the Wife, and declined to make an order for shared care and control as sought by the Husband, However, I granted the Husband weekend access with the child, including an overnight access.

24     It bears reiterating that every family is different. Blood ties or relations are by no means the only gauge of a family. Credit is given to the Wife’s aunt and uncle (and to a certain extent, their adult children too) for their dedication and commitment to the Child. They have stepped up in more ways than one to take on the role of “maternal grandparents”, in particular after the Wife secured employment. I did not doubt that they too wanted the best for the Child and looked upon the child as their own grandchild. And in a similar vein, I had no doubt that the paternal grandparents too should be given the same opportunity to assist and support the Husband with the upbringing of the child. It was also certainly not in the child’s interest to be denied the opportunity to bond with his Father and paternal grandparents, when there were no compelling reasons to suggest that the Father nor the paternal grandparents were unfit caregivers. There were no allegations of abusive, unfit or neglectful parenting.

25     The circumstances each family faces are unique to them, more so in such periods of transition; and yet the only constant is that the welfare of the Child which must take precedence over the rights and convenience of the parents.

26     In this instance, both parties are working parents who rely on 3rd party caregivers (be it grandparents or childcare centres) to help out with the child – this was not a bad thing and neither does it reflect any shortcomings on their part as parents who are able to discharge their parenting responsibilities.

27     In my opinion, the Child would benefit from time spent with the Father and paternal grandparents over the weekend. The Wife could not simply rely on the status quo argument or the fact that the Child had never spent a night apart from her as a reason to deny the Husband and his family to develop a meaningful relationship with the Child.

28     Accordingly, I made the orders I did.
