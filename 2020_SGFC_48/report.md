Family law – Custody, Care and Control – Access – Division of Matrimonial Assets – Maintenance

26 May 2020 - Judgment reserved.

### District Judge Chia Wee Kiat:

## Introduction

1       The Plaintiff shall be referred to as the “Wife” and the Defendant shall be referred to as the “Husband. The parties were married on 4 February 2002 in Kerala, India.[^1] There are two children to the marriage whom I share refer to in this judgment as \[J\] and \[K\] (redacted names). The children are 12 and 10 respectively this year.[^2] J is currently living with the Husband and K with the Wife.[^3]

2       The Husband is the Chief Executive Officer of \[AB\] Pte Ltd (“AB”),[^4] a company dealing with research and development on medical technologies and software development for interactive digital media.[^5] AB was incorporated by the Husband in May 2011.[^6] The Wife is a Business Development Manager[^7] with \[CD\] Pte Ltd.[^8]

3       The Husband started work in Singapore in 1997 and obtained Singapore Permanent Residency in 1999.[^9] When the Wife married the Husband in 2002, she was pursuing a Master’s degree in Pharmacy and the Husband was working in Singapore. The Wife says that after the marriage, she uprooted herself and came to Singapore to be with the Husband.[^10] The Wife obtained Singapore Permanent Residency in 2003.[^11]

4       The Husband says that the parties were involved in a road traffic accident in August 2002. The Wife required multiple operations and was in and out of the hospital until 2005. Each operation left the Wife immobile and requiring close care by the Husband.[^12] The Wife subsequently commenced DC Suit No. 1756 of 2007 (“DC 1756”)[^13] in which she was eventually awarded $174,000.[^14]

5       The Wife says that she joined the workforce sometime in 2004. [^15] She stopped working in 2007 and stayed home following a miscarriage. In 2008, J was born and K in 2010.[^16] The parties engaged a maid for five months and then another maid was engaged. After two years with the family, the Husband terminated her service and transferred her to another family without any reason.[^17] The Wife believes that the action by the Husband was to subtly dissuade her from returning to the workforce.[^18]

6       The Wife says she continued to stay home and cared for the children.[^19] She says that the Husband behaved and insisted on being treated as an “alpha male”. He would not assist her with any of the household chores. From 2011, the Husband failed to provide financially for the care of the children or groceries for the family. She had to plead with him for financial contributions but he would occasionally pay for the children’s kindergarten fees.[^20]

7       The Wife says that sometime in May 2012, she insisted to return to work but the Husband refused. Faced with various challenges while living with the Husband, she left the Husband in 2013 with the children.[^21] She had initially stayed at a friend’s house before finding a place to rent at Yishun.[^22] As the Husband did not provide any financial support throughout this period, she started work as a student care teacher in May 2013.[^23]

8       The Husband says that after the parties separated on 28 March 2013, the Wife denied him access to the children for a period of six months.[^24]

9       On 20 June 2013, the Husband filed OSF 272/2013/S (“OSF 272”) seeking joint custody of the children with care and control to him and reasonable supervised access to the Wife under the Guardianship of Infants Act (Cap 122, 1985 Rev Ed).

10     On 30 July 2013, the parties entered into a consent order FC/ORC12472/2013 (“ORC 12472”) before the learned District Judge Jen Koh giving parties joint custody of the children with interim care and control to the Wife and interim access to the Husband.[^25]

11     On 14 October 2013, the Wife commenced divorce proceedings (Divorce Suit No. D 5061 of 2013 (“D 5061”)) against the Husband on grounds of unreasonable behaviour.[^26]

12     On 28 May 2014, the interim access orders in ORC 12472 were varied by District Judge Jen Koh and this was followed by a further variation by the same judge on 7 July 2014. The variation in both instances enhanced the terms of access to the Husband.

13     The Husband says that in November 2014, the Wife again unilaterally withholds access to both children without any reasons given.[^27]

14     The Wife says that on 11 December 2014, she moved into the women’s shelter for a month through the help of the Family Service Centre (“FSC”) counsellors.[^28]

15     On 9 January 2015, the parties entered into a consent order _vide_ FC/ORC 384/2015 in OSF 272 for the Husband to vacate the matrimonial home by 15 January 2015.[^29]

16     Sometime after 15 January 2015, the Wife moved back into the matrimonial home.[^30]

17     On 19 July 2016, D 5061 was dismissed by the learned District Judge Wong Keen Onn[^31] (“the DJ”) after a 14-day trial.[^32] According to the Husband, he resumed access to the children after 22 months of unilateral withholding by the Wife.[^33]

18     On 4 November 2016, the Wife obtained a maintenance order in MSS 5535/2014 (“MSS 5535”) for the maintenance of the children.[^34] The Wife also obtained a Personal Protection Order (“PPO”) (PPO 1176/2016) in SS 2992/2014 (“SS 2992”) against the Husband on the same day.[^35]

19     According to the Wife, the Husband defaulted the maintenance payments and she has taken out enforcement applications against him.[^36] The Wife says that despite an Enforcement Order (EMO 1319/2018) being issued against the Husband, he continues to be in arrears.[^37]

20     The Wife says that on 26 May 2018, the Husband failed to return both of the children after exercising his lawful access.[^38] On 27 May 2018, the Wife made a police report.[^39]

21     The Wife says that she found out on 29 May 2018 that the Husband had taken the children to Kandang Kerbau Hospital on 26 May 2016 and lodged a report that she had abused them.[^40] She says that she was subsequently contacted by the Child Protection Service (“CPS”) of the Ministry of Social and Family Development (“MSF”) to arrange for a meeting.[^41]

22     On 1 June 2018, the Husband filed a PPO application (SS 1185/2018) against the Wife from committing family violence against him and the children.[^42]

23     The Wife says that at the meeting with CPS on 13 June 2018, she was informed that CPS and the police found no evidence of abuse and the matter was closed. She was also handed a Case Card with the classification “No offence disclosed” by the police officer present.[^43]

24     On 22 June 2018, the Husband filed FC/SUM 2242/2018 (“SUM 2242”) in OSF 272 to seek, _inter alia_, care and control of the children.

25     In July 2018, K returned to the Wife out of her own volition whilst J continues to reside with the Husband. [^44]

26     On 23 July 2018, the Wife commenced the current divorce proceedings (Divorce Suit No D 3401 of 2018 (“D 3401”)) on grounds of four years’ separation.[^45] The Husband contested the divorce.

27     On 19 October 2018, the DJ called for a Custody Evaluation Report (“CER”) in respect of SUM 2242 in OSF 272.

28     On 7 March 2019, an Interim Judgment (“IJ”) was granted[^46] by the DJ after a one-day trial with costs of $3,500 to be paid by the Husband to the Wife. The ancillary matters (“AM”) were adjourned to be heard in chambers.

29     The AM came up for hearing before me on 8 October 2019. The issues for determination are as follows:[^47]

> (a)     custody, care and control of the children and access;

> (b)     division of matrimonial assets;

> (c)     maintenance for the children; and

> (d)     maintenance for the Wife.

30     In addition to the above, it is common ground that SUM 2242 is to be dealt with at the AM hearing and that the court should have regard to the CER ordered by the DJ when considering the issue of custody, care and control of the children and access.

31     After hearing the parties’ submissions, I reserved my decision for the parties to file a Joint Summary by 29 October 2019 and their further written submissions to update their positions by 12 November 2019.

32     The Joint Summary was filed on 21 February 2020 and the parties filed their further written submissions on 28 February 2020. [^48]

33     At the 8 October 2019 hearing, the parties indicated that they have no objection for the decision of the court to be rendered in writing. This is permissible under Rule 670 of the Family Justice Rules.

34     Having carefully considered the Joint Summary and the further submissions of the parties, I now set out my decision and the accompanying reasons.

## Custody, care and control and access

35     The parties agree to joint custody of J and K but both parties seek care and control of the children.[^49]

#### The Wife’s position

36     The Wife says that the Husband has breached the Order of Court dated 7 July 2014 (ORC 11786/2014) which has led to the present situation of split care and control, where J resides with the Husband and K resides with the Wife.[^50]

37     The Wife says the Husband’s abuse against her and their children was one of the reasons she moved out with her children as she was unable to endure the torment of the Husband any further. She refers to a letter from a FSC dated 4 April 2013[^51] written on her behalf to the Family Court requesting for the court to assist to get the children’s passports from the Husband. The letter alleged that the Husband had been harsh in his discipline with the two children and that he had hit the children’s buttocks with a cane, and would be doing the hitting out of anger. The letter also made mention of an incident where the Husband had a physical struggle for their son in the public and the police were alerted by members of the public to the scene.

38     On 4 November 2016, the Wife obtained a PPO (PPO 1176/2016)[^52] against the Husband.

39     The Wife says the Husband has made false and unsubstantiated allegations against her of abuse towards the children. She says that she was subjected to a fruitless investigation by MSF and the police, which concluded with no offence being disclosed and the Husband being ordered to return J to the Wife.[^53]

40     The Wife says that she has been the primary caretaker of the children from their birth and has continually showered them with love and affection. K has chosen to stay with her and not the Husband of her own volition.[^54] The Husband’s hostility and grievances against the Wife has instilled in the mind of J that he should not stay with his mother. She alleges that the Husband is using J as a pawn and turning him against his own mother.[^55] She says the Husband does not allow her to speak with J and continues to be unreasonable in allowing her access to him. The Husband’s actions have also forced a wedge in an otherwise healthy relationship between J and K, who misses her brother.[^56]

41     The Wife also questions the Husband’s ability to provide for the children, especially in light of his claims that he has ceased to receive a salary.[^57]

42     The Wife maintains that care and control should be awarded to her and for J to be returned to live with her and K. The Wife says that she does not want to tarnish the children’s relationship with their father and wishes for them to spend time with each other. However, due to her lack of trust that the Husband will obey the access order and the fear that the Husband may use physical force against the children out of anger or as an unnecessarily harsh disciplinary method, the Wife seeks that supervised access be granted to the Husband.[^58]

#### The Husband’s position

43     The Husband says that the children have been primarily cared for by him from birth. He says that he left his job in January 2008 to support the Wife during the third trimester of her pregnancy with J, who was born in May 2008. He subsequently returned to work but took on a more flexible role in order to care for the Wife and J. When K was born in June 2010, he took time off his academic pursuits in order to care for K. As the children were growing up, the Husband would be the one to feed, bathe and play with them, and take care of them when they fell ill. He would instil in them good habits and values and take time to guide them in their studies and arrange for tuition classes where necessary.[^59]

44     The Husband says that with the rocky relationship between the parties, it is in the paramount interest of the children that they remain together to support each other. However, the Wife continues to deliberately pit the children against each other, alienating them from each other. J missed his sister and on numerous instances, told the Husband that he yearns for the company of K.[^60]

45     The Husband says the Wife has deliberately alienated the children from him, by prohibiting them from even orally addressing him as their father and bringing them overseas without his knowledge or consent.[^61] Notwithstanding the Wife’s behaviour, the Husband has continued to persevere in his efforts to ensure that the children’s welfare are well taken care of.[^62]

46     The Husband alleges that the Wife had deliberately caused hurt to J on several occasions. He says he has exhibited photographs showing the Wife’s abuse inflicted upon J in his pending PPO application against the Wife.[^63]

47     The Husband says that apart from withholding access of K to the Husband and preventing the siblings from spending time together, the Wife has also forbidden K from sharing her phone number with J. [^64] The Husband says he has been denied access to K for over a year and the little that he knows about her life is through J. [^65] The Husband says J has indicated to him that he wishes to stay with him despite the interim care and control orders in place.[^66]

48     The Husband is concerned about K’s wellbeing and character development. He says that K is often left alone in school while waiting for the Wife to pick her up, and on her own because the Wife is busy with work and her personal life.[^67]

49     The Husband says there have been multiple complaints about K exhibiting violent behaviour in school. Although the Husband does not have access to K and is not the parent with care and control, he has tried to resolve this matter as the Wife has paid no heed to these complaints.[^68]

50     The Husband says the Wife no longer has a helper to assist with caring for the children. Meanwhile, the Husband’s mother is willing and able to work to help care for the children when the Husband returns to work. Furthermore, the Wife is required to travel frequently for her work. This would mean that if the children are in her care and control, they would have to be left alone at home without anyone to take care of them.[^69]

51     The Husband says he is alive to the fact that the children should build a relationship and spend time with the Wife. The Husband is amenable for reasonable supervised access to be granted to the Wife and on the condition that the Wife provides an undertaking that no family violence be committed against the Husband or the children during the access and handover.[^70]

52     The Husband asks that the court take into account the findings in the CER[^71] and requests that the court interview the children so as to be apprised of the circumstances surrounding the children’s upbringing thus far, to determine what the children themselves want and ultimately to determine what is in the best interests of the children.[^72]

#### Welfare of the children

53     It is trite law that in deciding custody, care and control issues, the court must regard the welfare of the child as the paramount consideration. Section 125(2) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“WC”) provides as follows:

> In deciding in whose custody, or in whose care and control, a child should be placed, the paramount consideration shall be the welfare of the child and subject to this, the court shall have regard —

>> (a)    to the wishes of the parents of the child; and

>> (b)    to the wishes of the child, where he or she is of an age to express an independent opinion.

54     As noted earlier, the Husband has suggested that the court speak to the children. At the AM hearing on 8 October 2019, he had even brought J to court. The _locus classicus_ on the judicial interview of children is _AZB v AZC_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHCF 1</span> (“_AZB v AZC_”) where Debbie Ong JC (as she then was) stated as follows (at \[55\]):

> The judicial interview of children should remain an important option within our family justice system which employs the judge-led approach to proactively manage cases and protect the welfare of children. It may be used if the judge considers it appropriate in furthering the interests of the children. The paramount consideration is, at the end of the day, the welfare of the child. However, judges are not compelled to interview children. There may be legitimate concerns if a judge is uncomfortable with speaking to a child, or is unaware of the limitations of such judicial interviews. Interviewing children may not always be the best way to proceed, for much depends on the specific circumstances. There are limitations to such an exercise, and it is prudent to bear in mind that useful information can also be obtained from the parents, lawyers, a Child Representative or a mental health professional. The availability of such options should also assuage any concerns that judges may have in “drawing children into the fray” of contentious legal proceedings through interviewing them directly. The court can order reports such as a Social Welfare Report, Custody Evaluation Report, Access Evaluation Report, Assisted Access Report to be produced with the assistance of professionals from the appropriate disciplines. Further, ss 27 and 28 of the Family Justice Act 2014 (No 27 of 2014) give judges the powers to appoint assessors. It can appoint a registered medical practitioner, psychologist, counsellor, social worker or mental health professional to examine and assess the child for the purposes of preparing expert evidence for use in proceedings. Rule 30 of the Family Justice Rules allows the court, if it thinks it is in the children's best interests, to appoint a Child Representative, whose role is to “represent the child’s views and best interests in court proceedings, thus helping to ensure that the decisions eventually made by the court are in the child’s best interests” (_The Committee Report_ at para 163). Through these various avenues, children can express their views to the judges directly or through professionals entrusted by the court to represent their interests and views. These are not mutually exclusive, and all are important options in giving the court reliable information about the children’s views and wishes.

55     It is clear from the above that there is a variety of methods that can give children a voice in the proceedings. These methods include the judge interviewing the children directly or the court ordering reports such as a Social Welfare Report or a CER. In the present case, as a CER was ordered by the DJ and a detailed report has since been rendered, I find it unnecessary to involve the children in the proceedings again. Apart from the fact that a CER is available, I find from the allegations made by each party that the children have been triangulated in the parents’ disputes. The children should be protected from the harm arising from such conflicts and should not have to carry the emotional burden of having to choose which parent to side with.

56     As noted in the Report of the Committee to Review and Enhance Reforms in the Family Justice System dated 13 September 2019 at page 11:

> 21.    Divorces are traumatic for all parties, especially for the children involved. Studies have shown that depending on the child’s maturity and understanding of what has taken place, the impact of the parents’ divorce continues to be felt by the child in each developmental stage. It may affect the child’s personality, the ability to trust and cope with change and expectations about relationships.

> 22.    The ability of divorcing couples to anticipate the changes that will arise from the divorce, to manage their own emotional and mental stress, and to communicate well with each other can have a significant bearing on the outcomes of children caught in divorce.

57     The wellbeing of the children is in the hands of the parties. The discharge of parental responsibility requires the hard work and personal sacrifices of both parents in reducing conflict and minimising their acrimony (see _AZB v AZC_ (at \[3\])) and to facilitate the children’s relationship with the other parent (see _VDZ v VEA_ \[2020\] SGHCF2 (at \[46\])). J and K are still young. The ability of their parents to co-parent in their best interests will shape the formative years of their lives.

58     Unfortunately, the parties in the present case have been mired in litigation. This is acknowledged by the Husband as follows:[^73]

> There have been numerous applications filed by both parties in respect of interim custody, care and control, access, maintenance, orders relating to the passports of the Children, orders for the Defendant to vacate the matrimonial home, as well as the filing of various police reports, applications for Personal Protection Orders (“PPOs”) and contempt proceedings from before D5061 to date.

59     Both have made serious allegations against the other. The Wife says the Husband is in breach of the access orders but the Husband says it was the Wife who has repeatedly denied him access to the children. The Wife says the Husband has been abusive towards the children but the Husband says the Wife has deliberately caused hurt to J on several occasions. The Wife says K has chosen to stay with her but the Husband says J has chosen to stay with him. The Wife says the Husband has turned J against her but the Husband says the Wife has deliberately alienated the children from him. The Wife says the Husband has forced a wedge in the relationship between J and K but the Husband says the Wife has deliberately pit the children against each other. The Wife says she does not trust the Husband that he will not use harsh disciplinary method on the children but the Husband says the Wife should provide an undertaking that she will not use family violence against the children.

60     The inability of the parties to see eye to eye and the deep mistrust for each other have led to multiple applications in court. Both are insisting that the care and control of the children should be awarded to them, each claiming that they are acting in the best interests of the children.

61     The unfortunate reality is that the children are caught in the crossfire of their parents’ conflicts. It is apparent to me that the children are sad, confused and worried by all that has transpired. The parties seem oblivious to the fact that their endless conflicts have exacted a toll on the children, which must be overwhelming for any child to bear.

62     The level of acrimony between the parties remains high at this stage. In my assessment, any transfer of care and control to the other parent will be too drastic for the children, which may subject them to even more anxiety. For now, it would be in the children’s best interests for them to be remain under the care of the current respective parent. This would support the children’s stability and continuity in the children’s current living arrangements and minimise the anxiety and uncertainty the children have been experiencing regarding their living arrangements.

63     It is important for the parents to refrain from commenting about each other negatively in the presence of the children and sharing the contents of court documents with them. In _AZB v AZC_, the court recounted a poignant passage which summarizes what children of separated parents need and long for. I find it worthwhile to cite the passage in full in the hope that this may provide the insights much needed by the parties. The court said (at \[42\]) as follows:

> It is apt that I conclude with a particularly poignant passage from _Children's views of shared time, parenting and security post-separation_ at pp 15–16 (_supra_ at \[**Error! Reference source not found.**\]), which summarizes what children of separated parents need and long for, like any other child does:

>> In that light, we conclude with reflections inspired by the children in this study on the advice other children might give to their parents about creating a way to feel ‘securely shared’. The following statement was written for parents by the authors, based on what our subjects told us, and in a style children might use:

>> When I feel securely shared, I know I don’t have to constantly keep watch over how you will act when you are together (at places like handovers, or my school or sporting events). Knowing that you won’t fight is really important. But that’s not enough. I want to see you act in ways that show me that you can sometimes still laugh and have fun with each other, and share your pride and joy in me. When I see this, I relax and feel good, instead of being worried and watchful whenever you are together. Sometimes when I am at your house, I might be feeling sad, or scared, or upset, and I might start to miss my ‘other’ parent. You and my other parent aren’t the same, and you do things differently. There are times when I just need to reach out to the parent I’m not with, to help me feel okay again. When I feel like this, I want to know that it is alright for me to call, or even see them – even though it is ‘your turn’ with me. **_It makes it really hard for me when I have to worry about hurting your feelings because I miss the other person, and just need them. I’m still a kid with two parents, and I can’t always get all my needs met by the parent I am with at the time._** I will learn to cope with my grief, and I will adjust to you being separate, but there are some needs I can’t just switch off, without creating big problems for myself. When I feel securely shared, I feel like I live in one world, not two. I feel like both my parents are in touch with, and responsive to most things I feel and need. You both make sure that my arrangements and the way you put them into place don’t bury me under emotional burdens. You’re not expecting me to live between two completely unconnected households. You make sure I’m not too weighed down with the practical problems of living in between two houses. You can come together and make sure that my arrangements are predictable, but flexible – both on a day-to-day basis, and as I grow and my needs change over time. **_Sometimes, my needs might be different from yours. When this happens, I’d be really grateful if you might put aside your own needs, and think honestly about mine, and what could help_**. There was this guy called Bowlby, who said **_the job of parents is to be bigger, stronger, wiser and kind._** That about sums up what I’m asking for. These are things that you can do to help me to thrive in shared time. \[emphasis added\]

> Parents, in discharging their parental responsibility, should endeavour to help the other parent to be the best parent possible under the circumstances, for this is in the children’s welfare.

> \[emphasis in original\]

64     Although the parties’ relationship may be currently strained, I am hopeful that with the help of a trained counsellor and the passage of time, they would acquire the skills to help them establish a co-operative parenting relationship so that the children can maintain a loving relationship with both parents in the post-divorce family. The parties have different parenting methods and styles but they are both steadfast in their love for the children. Notwithstanding their distrust of each other, they have both affirmed the need for the children to maintain a positive relationship with the other parent. There is hence hope that the parties are capable of becoming bigger, stronger and kinder for the children. The differences between them are not insurmountable.

## Orders – Custody, care and control and access

65     For the reasons set out above, my orders are as follows:

> (a)     The parties be granted joint custody of the children with care of control of J to the Husband and care and control of K to the Wife.

> (b)     The parties be granted facilitated access with the child not living with them with the support of the Divorce Support Specialist Agency (“DSSA”). The DSSA counsellor is to assess the progress of parent-child readiness and commence contact time at a suitable stage as determined by the counsellor. The parties shall cooperate and work with the DSSA counsellor.

> (c)     The parties and the children are to attend such counselling and therapy as may be deemed appropriate by the DSSA counsellor to address the difficulty with regard to access as well as the following areas:

>> (i)       promoting each child’s relationship with both parents；

>> (ii)       promoting sibling relationship;

>> (iii)       address divorce-related stress and grief for parents and children；

>> (iv)       coaching parents on boundaries and age-appropriate autonomy; and

>> (v)       restoring adequate parent, co-parenting and parent-child roles.

> (d)     The children should be encouraged to have regular contact time to bond with each other without the interference of either parent.

> (e)     Subject to the prevailing regulations on Covid-19 to safeguard public health, the children shall have weekly contact time with each other, to be facilitated by the school counsellor, at the school till the start of the year-end holiday.

> (f)     The children shall have weekly contact time with each other at the DSSA from the start of the 2020 year-end holiday.

> (g)     The parties may, with the help from the DSSA counsellor, work out an access plan that caters to the developmental needs of the children whilst assuring them, to the greatest extent possible, of a normal family life with two parents.

> (h)     The DSSA may, in its discretion, conduct such facilitated access, counselling or therapy _via_ online platforms having regard to the prevailing risks and regulations on Covid-19 to safeguard public health and parties shall comply with such guidelines as may be prescribed by the DSSA for the remote services.

> (i)     The parties shall bear the costs of such assisted access, counselling and therapy, if any, equally between them.

66     As the current level of acrimony is high, the intent of these orders is to create some stability for the children in the coming two years. When J becomes 14 years of age, he would likely require more time for himself like most teenagers would. He may then require more flexibility to his schedule and not want to stick to the weekly contact time at the DSSA. So too would K. Hence, the access arrangements will need to evolve and be fitting to the children’s developmental needs. Under the access orders, there is room for the parties to mutually adjust the contact time based on the interest and needs of the children with the help of the DSSA counsellor.

67     As noted in _VDN v VDO_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGFC 146</span> (at \[19\] & \[20\]), no one is in a better position to help the children lead normal and happy lives in the post-divorce family than the parents themselves. Decisions made by the parties themselves allow for greater flexibility that is necessary to cater to changes to the schedules of the parties, the changing needs of the children and the vicissitudes of life that can never be fully anticipated in a court order. The Covid-19 pandemic is a stark reminder. It is hope that with the anticipated stability experienced by the children, the parties may see the benefits and begin to rebuild some trust, confidence and motivation as co-parents.

70     As noted in _UYP v UYQ_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHCF 16</span> (at \[4\]):

> As a general position, the operative date for the identification of MAs is the date of the IJ, and all MAs should be valued at the date of the ancillary matters (“AM”) hearing. Balances in the parties’ bank and Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) accounts are to be taken at the date of the IJ, as the MAs are the moneys and not the bank and CPF accounts themselves.

71     With these principles in mind, I turn now to consider the values of the joint assets.

##### S/N 1 – Matrimonial Flat (Bukit Batok)

72     The matrimonial home is a HDB flat in Bukit Batok. There is no outstanding loan.[^76] The flat was purchased on 1 March 2005.[^77]

73     The Husband states that the approximate value of the flat is $490,000[^78] whilst the Wife’s estimate is $525,000.[^79] The Wife’s value is based on the resale prices obtained from the HDB Resale Flat Prices on 23 July 2018.[^80] The resale registration dates of the comparable flats were from July 2017 to July 2018. The Wife contends that the Husband has undervalued the matrimonial flat and that he has not provided a basis for his valuation.[^81]

74     Contrary to the Wife’s assertion, I note that the Husband did provide a basis for his valuation. The Husband has produced resale prices of comparable flats obtained from the HDB Resale Flat Prices In fact, the Husband’s search (16 May 2019) is even more recent than the Wife’s (23 July 2018), and the resale registration dates of the comparable flats are more current (November 2018 to May 2019). From the resale prices, the value of $490,000 estimated by the Husband is not unreasonable.

75     As noted in _VGR v VGS_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGFC 27</span> (“_VGR v VGS_”) (at \[41\]), the valuation closest to the AM date is generally preferred although this principle must be applied sensibly and according to the facts of the case. Valuation is not a precise science. In appropriate cases, it is permissible to take the average of two valuations.

76     In the present case, neither of the parties sought to obtain a formal valuation report on the matrimonial flat. They have both chosen to estimate the value of the matrimonial flat from the resale values obtained from the HDB Resale Flat Prices. As the Husband’s comparables are more current, they are a better reflection of the resale value of the matrimonial flat as at the date of the AM hearing. Accordingly, I adopt the figure of $490,000 as the estimated value of the matrimonial flat.

##### S/N 2 - POSB Savings A/C No. ~9086

77     From the Joint Summary[^82], there is a joint account (POSB Savings A/C No.~9086) which was closed on 12 May 2010. The Wife says that she was given a debit card for the account when she joined the Husband in Singapore after marriage. All her income from the years 2004 to 2007 was credited into this account. She stopped working in 2007 following a miscarriage. She says that the Husband took back the debit card in 2010. The Wife would like to know what happened to the monies in the bank account and suspects that the Husband had been withdrawing large sums of money before closing the bank account with $190 balance. She would like “her share of the monies” before the Husband withdrew the large sums of money.[^83] She asserts that the Husband has not disclosed the bank statements detailing the account balance and withdrawals for this account and she estimates the amount to be $70,000. She contends that an adverse inference should be drawn against the Husband.[^84]

78     The Husband states that while this joint account was the only bank account held by him (whose income went solely to this account), the Wife had in 2007 directed her salary to another account held in her sole name. At all material times, the Wife remained a joint account holder whilst the bank account remained opened and she was free to access it as she wished. There was no limitation as to how the Wife could use and access the joint bank account. [^85] He disagrees with the Wife’s allegation that he took away her debit card. As an account holder the Wife had full access to the joint account and was at liberty to request for a new card to be issued if she had lost her old one. [^86]

79     The Husband states in the Joint Summary that all household expenses and payments came from this account and that the Wife had contributed $10,000 to the bank account while the Husband contributed the remainder. The Husband has no objection to the sum of $190.98 amount being placed in the pool for division.[^87] The Wife contends that the assertions by the Husband in the Joint Summary are not set out in his affidavit and wants “her share of the monies”.[^88]

80     As parties are unable to come an agreement on this issue, the Wife’s claim will have to be determined. As a starting point, I note that the Wife has not articulated the basis at law on which she is seeking to recover “her share of the monies” from the Husband other than asserting that an adverse inference should be drawn against him.

81     In order for an adverse inference to be drawn, it must be demonstrated that (a) there is a substratum of evidence which establishes a _prima facie_ case against the person against whom the inference is to be drawn and (b) that person has some particular access to the information he is said to be concealing or withholding: see _Koh Bee Choo v Choo Chai Huah_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] SGCA 21</span> at \[28\]. As for the first of these requirements, there must be some evidence which suggests on its face that the party in question has deliberately sought to conceal or deplete some assets which would otherwise be available for division: see _BOR v BOS _<span class="citation">\[2018\] SGCA 78</span> (“_BOR v BOS_”) at \[75\].

82     In my judgment, the Wife has failed to establish a _prima facie_ case against the Husband. There is no evidence to suggest that the Husband has deliberately sought to conceal or deplete assets which would otherwise be available for division. It is not disputed that the joint account was closed in 2010 with a balance of $190.98. In the period leading to the closing of the joint account, the parties were starting a family. The Wife had a miscarriage in 2007 and subsequently gave birth to J in 2008 and K in 2010. There is simply no reason for the Husband to be deliberately concealing or depleting assets.

83     Indeed, the Wife’s main contention is that the Husband has not produced the bank statements detailing the account balance and withdrawals for this account. However, she did not explain why she could not have obtained this information herself as a joint account holder. In the absence of any explanation as to her own failure to do so, I find no merit in the Wife’s complaint against the Husband.

84     The joint account was closed with a balance of $190.98. As this was some 10 years ago, it can be assumed that the amount would have been expended by now. There is no reason to single out this small sum for division a decade later. Accordingly, the joint account shall be excluded from the asset pool.

##### S/N 3 - Car

85     The Wife states that the car was bought at $67,000 under her name as the Husband did not have a driving licence until the second half of 2007. The car was purchased using the monies from the joint account POSB Savings A/C No.~9086 which she had contributed her salaries to. The car was transferred to the Husband’s name on his compulsion in November 2012. The Wife did not receive any monies from the scrapping and deregistration of the car. She does not know the value received after scrapping.[^89]

86     The Husband disagrees that the Wife had transferred the car to his name under any compulsion. In fact, the Wife took the car away for her exclusive use despite the Husband having paid for the hire purchase instalments. The Husband deregistered the vehicle on 16 January 2015 and paid the $80 fee to do so. The Husband has no objections to the PARF and COE rebates amounting to $7,170 ($7,164 + $6) to be included in the asset pool.[^90]

87     For the purpose of determining the value of the car, it is immaterial whether the car was transferred to the Husband by the Wife under compulsion. What is not disputed is that the car was deregistered on 16 January 2015. As the parties have agreed in the Joint Summary that the car is a matrimonial asset, the value of the car from the deregistration should be included in the asset pool. The Husband has exhibited documentary records from the Land Transport Authority which show that the car was successfully deregistered on 16 January 2020 and the PARF and COE rebates amounted to $7,170.[^91]

88     In the circumstances, the sum of $7,170 shall be included in the asset pool as the scrap value of the car.

##### S/N 4 – Rental Income

89     In the Joint Summary[^92], the Wife states that during the period 2005 to 2006, the Husband decided it would be best to rent out a room in the matrimonial flat. A room was rented out for 12 months for $500 a month. The rental monies were paid to the Husband by the tenant in cash. In 2012, the Husband sublet the master bedroom of the matrimonial flat for 18 months at $1,200 per month and 11 months during the period of 2013 and 2014 at $2,000 per month. The Wife says she was not given any of this rental income although she jointly owned the matrimonial flat. She has included a sum of $51,600 as rental income for division.[^93]

90     In his further written submissions, the Husband states that after he had returned the Joint Summary with his input on 27 December 2019, the Wife furnished her reply on 6 February 2020 and added a new item at Part D, S/No. 4 (Rental Income) under the header “ASSETS AGREED TO BE MATRIMONIAL ASSETS”. The Husband wholly disagrees with this and disputes that this should form part of the pool of the matrimonial assets. Furthermore, the Husband has not had the opportunity to respond to this point as a result of the Wife’s late and incorrect inclusion of this item under this header.

91     The Joint Summary is a key document which the court relies on as a summary of the parties’ respective positions. If the Husband’s assertion is true, it would mean that the inclusion of the rental income as an agreed matrimonial asset in the Joint Summary by the Wife is misleading. I assume this is an inadvertent error on the part of the Wife.

92     The rental income which was alleged to be taken by the Husband dates back to 2005 to 2014 well before the date of the IJ. During a substantial part of this period, the parties were living together as an intact and functional family. In fact, they were starting a family - J was born in 2008 and K in 2010. Any rental income taken by the Husband was likely to have been used for personal and family expenses and would in any event, have been accounted for in the net value of the assets disclosed by the parties.

93     For the above reasons, I am unable to find any justification to include the alleged rental income of $56,000 in the asset pool. I find support for this approach in _TNC v TND_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 3 SLR 1172</span> (“_TNC v TND_”) (at \[31\]) where the court had similarly excluded the alleged rental income taken by the parties before the date of the IJ.

#### Total value of joint assets

94     In summary, the total value of the joint assets to be included in the asset pool is tabulated as follows:

96     Of the five assets listed above, the Husband disagrees with the value stated by the Wife in respect of S/N 1 (POSB e-Savings A/C No~1496). In the Joint Summary, he explains that he has come across an account statement dated May 2011 for this account with a balance of $193,299.08.[^95] In his further written submissions, the Husband elaborates as follows. He says that the Wife benefitted from a huge insurance payout in DC 1756 (the Wife’s personal injury claim) in which final judgment was entered into on 23 November 2010 for the sum of $174,000. Although he bore all medical and related expenses during this time, the monies went straight into the Wife’s sole bank account and he does not know what has become of these monies.[^96] The Husband says the Wife cancelled a Prudential policy on 21 March 2013 and the payout of $76,643.45 was credited to her POSB e-Savings Bank Account No.~1496. He says that the Wife has not made full and frank disclosure of her bank accounts as these are large sums of monies, i.e. $250,643.45 (i.e. $174,000 and $76,643.45) which have seemingly disappeared.[^97]

97     The Wife says that both parties received third party insurance payouts from the accident that they were involved in. The Wife received $174,000 and the Husband received $100,000. The Husband credited this amount to his sole bank accounts.[^98] The refusal of the Husband to financially support the Wife and the children had resulted in the Wife using all her monies on the rental and expenses as well as the children’s school/preschool tuition fees, and also for her upkeep and maintenance as she was unemployed when she left the matrimonial flat in 2013.[^99] She paid $1,000 a month to rent a room in a Yishun flat for her children and herself. The Wife says she did not receive any financial support from the Husband throughout this period. The Wife started to look for a job so that she could provide financially for her children. This was a particularly tough period in her life as she had to adjust to life as a single mother, looking for employment as well as attending counselling and therapy.[^100] As of September 2019, the Husband is in arrears of maintenance amounting to $25,659.[^101]

98     The evidential burden of proof lies on a party asserting a proposition or refuting other evidence brought into play: see _UJF v UJG_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHCF 1</span> (at \[55\]). The Husband’s contention that the Wife has not made full and frank disclosure rests on the monies that she received in November 2010 and March 2013. However, the mere fact that the Wife had received these sums of monies in the distant past is not sufficient by itself to prove that there are still monies subsisting today that she has not disclosed. Given the length of time between the dates she received the monies (November 2010 and March 2013 respectively) and the date of the account balance (November 2018), it is not inconceivable that the monies had been spent in the intervening period for the reasons explained by the Wife. In my judgment, the Husband has failed to discharge the evidential burden of proving his assertion. I note further that the Husband himself had received $100,000 of insurance payout from the same accident the Wife was involved in. The Husband has vehemently denied that the insurance payout to him forms part of the asset pool[^102] but yet he has insisted that the insurance payout to the Wife be included. I find the duplicitous position taken by the Husband to be wholly untenable.[^103]

99     In the circumstances, I accept the Wife’s position that the total value of her assets to be included in the asset pool is $55,888.30.

## Husband’s Assets

100    According to the Joint Summary, there are eight assets under the Husband’s sole name which are not disputed to be matrimonial assets:[^104]

  

101    The remarks in italics in the table above are comments inserted by the Wife in the Joint Summary. From the Joint Summary, there are two disputes raised by the Wife in respect of the value of the Husband’s assets:

> (a)     The Wife took the balances in the bank accounts (S/N 1-2) as at 31 May 2019 instead of the balances provided by the Husband taken as at 31 March 2019; and

> (b)     The Wife says the value of the Husband’s assets is more than $147,543.53.

102    With respect to the first point, the Wife did not explain why she has taken 31 May 2019 as the operative date to determine the balances in the Husband’s bank accounts.[^105] As a general principle, the balances in the parties’ bank accounts are to be taken at the date of the IJ.[^106] In the present case, the IJ was granted on 7 March 2019. As the balances provided by the Husband are as at 31 March 2019 which is closer to the date of the IJ, there is no reason to take the balances at 31 May 2019. In any event, the difference is so inconsequential that this should not have been an issue in dispute. As noted by the Court of Appeal in _UYQ v UYP_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 3</span> (at \[4\]), parties should focus on the major details as opposed to every conceivable detail under the sun. Taking an overly rigid and calculative approach would detract from their respective cases instead of enhancing them.

103    With respect to the second point, the Wife contends that the Husband earns way more than he has disclosed and that he has many bank transfers into his account and this money is always transferred out to other bank accounts, which the Wife contends is the Husband’s other bank accounts in India or other countries which he has not disclosed.[^107] She says that he is a director and shareholder of four companies and continues to pay rent of $1,800, incur living expenses and even manages to pay instalments in the amount of $8,549 in August 2019 for the matrimonial flat.[^108]

104    The Wife says she has requested for more information through a Request for Interrogatories in relation to the four companies, the Husband’s employment and his sources of income to no avail due to the Husband’s refusal to respond to the Interrogatories. As the Husband is the sole director of the companies, the Wife verify believes that he has conveniently ceased giving himself a salary on record following the commencement of divorce proceedings. The Wife contends that an adverse should be drawn for his failure to produce the requested documents.[^109] Further, if the Husband is in fact not earning an income, it is inconceivable that he would seek care and control of the children.[^110]

105    The Husband says that he is currently unemployed and whilst he is a director and shareholder in four companies, they are not profit-making and he has not drawn any income since December 2018. He relies heavily on the financial support of family and friends and has taken out loans to pay for household expenses and the cost of legal proceedings which the Wife has subjected him to.[^111]

106    The Husband says that the Wife has pursued numerous requests for discovery and interrogatories against him in an attempt to allege that he has not made full and frank disclosure of his assets. This is despite the Husband’s repeated statements that he has provided whatever he is able to.[^112]

107    The Husband says he has displayed his readiness and willingness to give full and frank disclosure throughout the proceedings. This is borne out in the voluntary affidavits filed by the Husband wherein voluminous bank statements, credit card statements and company account statements have been disclosed. During the case conference on 11 September 2019, the learned Deputy Registrar had indicated that if the Wife were to continue pursuing the requests for discovery and interrogatories despite the Husband’s affidavit evidence that he had made full and frank disclosure, and if the Wife was found to be “flogging a dead horse” in relation to the companies, then the Wife would be ordered to bear the costs of the vacated hearing.[^113] The Husband says this indication was made on account of how the Wife has conducted the proceedings through her numerous and repeated requests for discovery and interrogatories which are akin to an abuse of process.[^114] Since 2013, the Wife has taken out numerous applications against him in the Family Court. The Husband says that some of these applications are frivolous and have drained his finances. His job and income have also been affected as he has had to constantly take time off work.[^115]

108    As noted earlier, the evidential burden of proof lies on a party asserting a proposition or refuting other evidence brought into play.[^116] The Wife asserts that she has requested for more information through a Request for Interrogatories in relation to the four companies, the Husband’s employment and his sources of income to no avail due to the Husband’s refusal to respond to the Interrogatories. However, I note that she has administered no less than three Requests for Discovery and Interrogatories in these proceedings and the Husband has responded to her requests in his voluntary affidavits.[^117]

109    For example, in response to the Wife’s request for his payslips from March 2017 to June 2019, the Husband explained that he had disclosed and exhibited copies of his payslips for the period of January 2016 to February 2017 in his first Affidavit of Assets and Means. He explains that he does not have the payslips for the period of March 2017 to date as the administrative staff had left AB and there was nobody to prepare the payslips. The Husband says that he is still owed his salary for a number of months in 2018 and has not received monthly income from AB since December 2018. He has also disclosed and exhibited his yearly IRAS Notice of Assessment from 1998 to 2015 as well as from 2018. [^118] He states that the total revenue of AB through sales since its inception is approximately $25,000 and the equity of AB is a negative value of $157,120.[^119] He has also exhibited the balance sheet and profit and loss statements of AB from 2012 to 2019.[^120] He states that AB no longer has any employee and does not pay Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) contributions[^121] and he has exhibited a letter dated 19 February 2019 from the CPF Board confirming the inactivation of AB from the submission of CPF contributions.[^122] In the face of such detailed explanation and documentation, the Wife did not explain what else is relevant and necessary that the Husband has not already provided.

110    The Wife claims that the Husband has many bank transfers into his account and this money is always transferred out to other bank accounts. Here again, the Wife did not provide any detail to substantiate her claim. I note that in her first Request for Discovery, the Wife had requested for OCBC, Citibank and UOB credit card statements on the basis that there were fund transfers appearing at pages 135, 136, 137, 138, 144, 145, 169 and 181 of the Husband’s first Affidavit of Assets and Means[^123] and the Husband has provided the answers to her request in his voluntary affidavit dated 20 August 2019[^124] . It is therefore unclear if the Wife is referring to some other bank transfers that have not already been addressed in her Request for Discovery for which answers have been provided. The onus is on the Wife to satisfy the court on the basis of her claim and not for the court to engage in a speculation as to what her basis might be. There is simply no reason for the court to form any conclusion on a claim that is vague and lacking in specificity.

111    For the above reasons, I find no justification to draw an adverse inference against the Husband. Accordingly, the total value of the Husband’s assets to be included in the asset pool is $147,543.53.

## Disputed Assets

112    From the Joint Summary, there are three assets that are disputed to be matrimonial assets:[^125]

##### S/N 1 – Payout from Prudential Insurance Policy No.~1123

113    The first disputed asset in the Joint Summary relates to the payout from Prudential Insurance Policy No.~1123.

114    The Husband says that the Wife received a payout of $76,643.45 being the surrender value of the policy pursuant to her request to surrender the policy. The Husband says that the policy was paid for by him and the surrender value was credited into the Wife’s POSB e-Savings Account No.~1496 sometime in or around 26 March 2013.[^126]

115    The Wife disputes that the Husband had contributed any money to this insurance. She says that she put in an amount of $75,000 into the insurance policy for savings purposes in 2012 and this money came from the third party insurance payout she received from the accident. She says that she was consistently harassed to give the Husband the money. In 2013, when she left the matrimonial flat and received no financial support from the Husband, she had to take the money out of the insurance policy to care for her children.[^127]

116    I note that the insurance payout from the surrender of the Wife’s insurance policy has already been canvassed by the Husband in the context of the Wife’s POSB e-Savings A/C No~1496[^128] and he is repeating the same issue in the context of the disputed assets. Such repetition is unnecessary and leads to a waste of time and resources. For the reasons I have explained earlier, the insurance payout is to be excluded from the asset pool.[^129]

##### S/N 2 – Gold Jewellery

117    The Husband says that there was various gold jewellery given by the Wife’s family as well as the Husband to the Wife when parties were first married. The Wife is also in possession of 453 grams of gold which is valued at approximately $64 per gram, totalling $28,992. The Husband purchased at least 100 grams of gold for the Wife (estimated at approximately $6,400). The Husband says that “this” should form part of the asset pool.[^130]

118    The Wife submits that the gold given to her by her family before her wedding to the Husband cannot be a matrimonial asset as this was a gift to her from her parents. The gold given to her by the Husband only consisted of a chain and a ring which were given to her as per the Indian custom during the wedding ceremony. The Husband himself has been gifted a chain and a ring from the Wife during the wedding ceremony.[^131]

119    Section 112(10) of the WC provides:

> (10)  In this section, “matrimonial asset” means —

>> (_a_)    any asset acquired before the marriage by one party or

>> both parties to the marriage —

>>> (i)    ordinarily used or enjoyed by both parties or one or more of their children while the parties are residing together for shelter or transportation or for household, education, recreational, social or aesthetic purposes; or

>>> (ii)   which has been substantially improved during the marriage by the other party or by both parties to the marriage; and

>> (_b_)    any other asset of any nature acquired during the marriage by one party or both parties to the marriage,

>> but does not include any asset (not being a matrimonial home) that has been acquired by one party at any time by gift or inheritance and that has not been substantially improved during the marriage by the other party or by both parties to the marriage.

120    In _UMU v UMT_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 504</span> (“_UMU v UMT_”) at \[8\], Debbie Ong J explained:

> The definition of a matrimonial asset in s 112(10) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the Charter”) focuses on two key features: first, it is an asset acquired _by effort_ and not by gift or inheritance, and second, it is an asset acquired _during_ marriage or has a connection to the efforts of the spouses _during_ marriage. Assets with these two characteristics have been described as “quintessential matrimonial assets”: see Leong Wai Kum, _Elements of Family Law in Singapore_ (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2018) (“_Family Law_”) at para 16.041; _TNC v TND_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 3 SLR 1172</span> at \[40\]; _TND v TNC_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 34</span> at \[9\]. Assets which do not have these characteristics may be “transformed” into matrimonial assets if they were ordinarily used or enjoyed by parties, constituted the matrimonial home or were substantially improved by the efforts of the parties _during_ the marriage: see s 112(10) of the Charter.

121    In the present case, the jewellery acquired by the Wife by way of gifts does not fall within the definition of a matrimonial asset under s 112(10) of the WC and should accordingly be excluded from the asset pool. I should point out that even if it were otherwise, I would have exercised my discretion to exclude the jewellery under the _de minimis_ exception: see _BNS v BNT_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHCF 5</span> (at \[21\]-\[22\]) and _VGR v VGS_ (at \[97\]).

##### S/N 3 – Payout of approx. $10,000 to the Husband

122    It is not disputed that the Husband received a payout of approximately $100,000 from the insurance claim in the accident that the Husband and the Wife were involved in. The Wife says that the Husband had put all the money in his bank account which was in his sole name.[^132]

123    The Husband vehemently denies that this forms part of the asset pool. The monies received for pain and suffering were for compensation and can in no way form part of the pool to be divided.[^133]

124    As it is trite law that compensation for pain and suffering that arise from a tortious wrongdoing are not assets acquired by the efforts of a spouse during marriage, the monies received by the Husband are personal to him and should not be included in the asset pool for division: see _UMU v UMT._ The same reasoning would have applied to the compensation received by the Wife for her pain and suffering, but the point is moot as the Wife has expended the monies on expenses for the children and herself over the years.[^134]

## Disputed Liabilities

125    In the Joint Summary, the disputed liabilities listed by the parties are as follows:[^135]

126    The first item S/N 1 relates to the “Outstanding Mortgage Loan”. There is a remark in the Joint Summary by the Husband which states “Fully paid by the Husband on 28 August 2019”[^136] and this was followed by a lengthy reply by the Wife[^137] which was reiterated in her further written submissions. [^138] It is unnecessary for me to go into the details of the submissions as I find none of these to be relevant to the issue at hand. As noted earlier, the operative date to value a matrimonial asset is the date of the AM hearing.[^139] The AM was heard on 8 October 2019. As at the AM hearing, it is not disputed that there was no outstanding mortgage loan. As such, this item should not have been included as a relevant liability to begin with.

127    The second item S/N 2 relates to “Monthly Rental”. In the Joint Summary, the Husband states that he lives in a rented property with J while the Wife and K live in the matrimonial home.[^140] In reply, the Wife states that the Husband has been paying his rental every month from his bank statements despite indicating “nil” on his salary. The Wife maintains that the Husband receives income and does not declare it as salary but rather “fund transfer” and “business expenses”.[^141] Again, I find none of these submissions to be relevant to the issue at hand. The monthly rental is a recurring expense incurred by the Husband and not a relevant liability to determine net value. Accordingly, S/N 2 is to be excluded.

128    The third to sixth items S/N 3 to 6 relate to various sums of loans allegedly taken out by the Husband from \[E\] (friend), \[F\] (brother), \[G\] (brother-in-law) and \[H\] (sister) (redacted names) respectively.[^142] The Husband says that these loans were taken out for personal and mostly household expenses.[^143] The Wife contends that these loans should be ignored as there is no documentary proof of them and that this is nothing more than a calculated attempt of depicting financing difficulty devised by a devious mind.[^144]

129    In _TNC v TND_, to arrive at the net value of the total pool of matrimonial assets, the court took into account the tax liability on the husband’s pension earnings and explained (at \[26\]) as follows:

> Because this liability relates to a matrimonial asset, and diminishes its net value, I have deducted this amount from the pool.

130    As noted in _VGR v VGS_ (at \[156\]), where a liability does not relate to a matrimonial asset, it should not be taken into account in arriving at the net value of the asset pool since the liability does not diminish the net value of any asset. In the present case, even if the Husband’s claim is accepted, the loans from \[E\], \[F\], \[G\] and \[H\] towards the payment of his personal and household expenses are not relevant to determine the net value of the asset pool and should accordingly be excluded.

131    The seventh item S/N 7 relates to the “Legal Fees – East Asia Law Corporation”. The Wife says she is indebted to East Asia Law Corporation for legal fees amounting to $8,366.22.[^145] The Husband disputes that this liability was incurred by virtue of s 112(2) of the WC as the legal fees were incurred by the Wife in the course of D 5061.[^146] In my judgment, this liability should be excluded as it does not relate to any matrimonial asset.

## Total Pool of Matrimonial Assets

132    Given my findings above, the net value of the asset pool that falls for division is $700,601.83. This is presented in tabular form as follows:

## Proportions of Division

133    From the Joint Summary[^152], it would appear that both parties in this case have adopted the structured approach laid out by the Court of Appeal in _ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGCA 34</span> (“_ANJ v ANK_”) (at \[22\]) comprising the following steps:

> Using the structured approach, the court could first ascribe a ratio that represents each party’s direct contributions relative to that of the other party, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party has made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets. Next, to give credit to both parties’ indirect contribution throughout the marriage, instead of giving the party who has contributed more significantly than the other an “uplift” to his or her direct contribution percentage, the court should proceed to ascribe a second ratio to represent each party’s indirect contribution to the well-being of the family relative to that of the other. Using each party’s respective direct and indirect percentage contributions, the court then derives each party’s average percentage contribution to the family which would form the basis to divide the matrimonial assets. Further adjustments (to take into account, inter alia, the other factors enumerated in s 112(2) of the WC) may need to be made to the parties’ average percentage contributions ….

134    The parties’ positions as reflected in the Joint Summary are as follows:

## Parties direct contributions

#### Joint Assets

##### Matrimonial flat

135    In respect of the matrimonial flat, it is not disputed that the Husband has contributed $265,348.62 in CPF and $13,529.10 in cash whilst the Wife has contributed $63,404.87 in CPF and $1,528 in cash.[^157]

136    The Husband states that he contributed $45,570.89 towards renovating and furnishing the matrimonial flat. The Husband says that the Wife did not contribute whatsoever to the renovation or furnishing.[^158] The Wife disputes that the Husband contributed $45,570.89 to the renovation. She says that a large part of the payment came from the joint account which the parties jointly contributed. She points out that the Husband does not have any separate bank account of his own at this time.[^159] On the other hand, the Wife says that she has paid for all the repairs, maintenance and purchase of furniture, electrical and household items on her own since 2015. She has produced receipts amounting to $4,313 which she says is just a fraction of her purchases.[^160] The Husband however points out these were only contributed from 2015 after he had vacated the matrimonial flat.[^161]

137    I find it appropriate to adopt a broad-brush approach to disregard the expenses for renovations and furnishing for the purpose of ascertaining the parties’ direct contributions to the acquisition and improvement of the matrimonial flat given the fact that the evidence does not show clearly the proportion of contributions by each party towards these expenses. The parties have also included a laundry list of items in the expenses (e.g. digital alarm clock, kitchen trolley, fridge, telephone, Home PC for children, massage chair) which have no bearing on the value of the flat.

138    In the circumstances, the Husband’s direct contribution to the acquisition of the matrimonial flat shall be taken to be $278,877.72 ($265,348.62 + $13,529.10) and the Wife’s direct contribution shall be taken to be $64,932.87 ($63,404.87 + $1,528).

##### Car

139    Although the parties have agreed that the scrap value of the car is a joint asset to be included in the asset pool,[^162] they have not indicated how their respective direct contributions are to be apportioned. Part E of the Joint Summary which sets out the parties’ direct and indirect contributions makes no reference to the car.[^163] Similarly, there is also no mention of the car in the parties further written submissions on their direct contributions.[^164]

140    As determined earlier, the scrap value of the car is $7170.[^165] Taking a broad-brush approach, the scrap value of the car shall be apportioned equally as their direct contributions, i.e. $3,585 each.

#### Wife’s Assets

141    The total value of the Wife’s assets to be included in the asset pool is $55,888.30.[^166] As there is no evidence that the Husband has made any direct contribution to the acquisition of these assets, the sum of $55,888.30 shall be wholly allocated to the Wife as her direct contribution towards her assets.

#### Husband’s Assets

142    The total value of the Husband’s assets to be included in the asset pool is $147,543.53.[^167] As there is no evidence that the Wife has made any direct contribution to the acquisition of these assets, the sum of $147,543.53 shall be wholly allocated to the Husband as his direct contribution towards his assets.

#### Summary of direct contributions

143    In summary, the parties’ direct contributions to the total asset pool are as follows:

## Parties’ indirect contributions

144    The Husband submits that he has indirectly contributed towards the family much more than the Wife has. Not only was he the primary provider of the children in terms of financial support, care and welfare, he was also the primary contributor to the household expenses. He has been paying for the town council service and conservancy charges for the matrimonial home in 2005 to date, contributing an aggregate of $9,934 as at April 2019. He has also contributed to an aggregate $2,242 being property tax payment for the matrimonial home.[^172] He says the Wife contributed $10,000 to the joint bank account and the remainder was borne solely by him.[^173]

145    The Husband says that when the Wife was badly injured in the 2002 road traffic accident, he took time off to care for the Wife and bore all medical and other expenses.[^174]

146    Additionally, the Husband says he has to deal with the Wife’s abusive and violent conduct, often in front of the children, and the damage this has caused to the children’s wellbeing. The Wife has also made various attempts to deliberately jeopardise his career and livelihood by intercepting investors in the Husband’s businesses, feeding them tales and untruths to tarnish the Husband’s reputation and discourage potential investors from investing, as well as subjecting the Husband to multiple legal proceedings since, including the 14-day trial in D 5061 which he successfully resisted. This has taken a toll on the Husband’s financial and emotional capacity. He submits that while the Wife has made some contributions, a negative value ought to be ascribed to her conduct towards the Husband and the children in the marriage. Accordingly, he submits that he has contributed 90% while the Wife only contributed 10% to the family.[^175]

147    The Wife disputes the Husband’s claim that she only contributed $10,000 to the bank account. She points out that this was not raised in the Husband’s affidavits.[^176] She says she opened a bank account separately in her name in 2006 and prior to this, she had only the joint account where she credited all her salaries in.[^177] The renovation and furnishings of the flat were drawn from the joint account.[^178] Before stopping work in 2007 following a miscarriage, she was earning approximately $42,000 annually.[^179]

148    The Wife says that when J was born in 2008, she used her Medisave to cover all antenatal, hospitalisation, delivery and post-natal charges. All expenses in relation to J were borne mostly from her Medisave and the remainder came from the joint account. When K was born in 2010, she had also used her Medisave to cover most of the antenatal, hospitalisation, delivery and post-natal charges for K. As the Husband was working, she was the primary caregiver to J and K.[^180] In addition, she has also used her insurance payouts amounting to $250,643.45 on expenses that included the children’s school and preschool tuition fees. She says that in 2013 to 2015, she solely supported the children.

149    In her further written submissions, the Wife says that she gave birth to their first child in 2008 and the second child in 2010. As the Husband dissuaded her from returning to the workforce, she did not work “from 2008 to 2015” in the interest of maintaining the household by cooking and cleaning as well as raising the children and looking after their general wellbeing.[^181] I pause here to note that the year “2015” in the further written submissions is an error as the Wife has stated in her affidavit that she left the matrimonial flat in 2013 and started work as a student care teacher in May the same year.[^182]

150    The Wife says that after the Husband vacated the matrimonial flat, he has not made any contribution towards the repairs and purchases to the flat, which have been borne solely by her. She submits that the Husband’s abusive conduct towards her and their children as well as the recurrent breaches of the access and maintenance orders should be taken into account in determining the ratio of the division.[^183]

151    The Wife also says the road traffic accident has left her with some long-term physical disabilities and she had undergone six surgeries over the span of five years. She was a pillion passenger on the Husband’s motorbike when the accident happened.[^184]

152    It is trite law that indirect contributions to the well-being of the family comprise of both non-financial and indirect financial contributions and the determination of the parties’ indirect contribution is an exercise in “broad strokes”: see _ARY v ARX_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGCA 13</span> (at \[55\]).

153    The submissions and affidavits of the parties are replete with allegations and petty disputes as each sought to amplify their indirect contributions to the family whilst downplaying the contributions made by the other party. For example, when the Wife says that she uprooted herself and came to Singapore to be with the Husband after they got married,[^185] the Husband says this is “misleading” as the Wife was keen to shift to Singapore as she had no home in Kerala, India.[^186] When the Wife says the children were cared for by her and she had to maintain the household,[^187] the Husband says the Wife preferred to leave the domestic matters and even the parenting of the children to him and she did not play any active role in the household.[^188] When the Husband says that he effectively dropped everything in his career to care for and assist the Wife’s rehabilitation from 2002 to 2005 after the road traffic accident,[^189] the Wife says that it was her mother who flew in to Singapore from Dubai who took care of her during this period.[^190] When the Husband says that he took a break from formal employment from January 2008 to April 2009 to look after the Wife during the third trimester of her pregnancy until J was born in May 2008, and then to look after her and the new-born,[^191] the Wife says that this was not linked to J’s birth and the wanting to take care of her but for his studies.[^192]

154    From 2002 when the time the Wife came to Singapore to 2013 when she left the matrimonial home, there were times when the parties were not working. Each has asserted that they have contributed to the well-being of the family and I have no reason to doubt the contributions they have made from my review of the affidavits. However, the evidence does not show that one has contributed more than the other in the domestic sphere or financial aspect.

155    The Wife says that when she left the matrimonial home in 2013, she single-handedly looked after the children. The Wife alleged that she moved away as she could not endure the abuse by the Husband.[^193] In the same year, she filed for divorce _vide_ D 5061 on the ground of the Husband’s alleged unreasonable behaviour, citing a number of allegations some of which are of a very serious nature.[^194] However, after a 14-day trial, the DJ did not find the Wife to be a credible witness on the material aspects of her case. The DJ found numerous discrepancies and inconsistences in her evidence in court as well as in her affidavit.[^195] Even her claim that she was not maintained by the Husband was contradicted by receipts produced by the Husband.[^196] The DJ found that the material allegations had not be proven satisfactorily and dismissed her writ of divorce.[^197] As it has not been proved that the Husband had behaved unreasonably, it would not be just to penalise the Husband for his inability to care for the children as a result of the Wife’s unilateral decision to take them away from him. So whilst it is true the Wife was the sole caregiver of the children when they were physically with her, it would not be just and equitable to accord any weight to such contribution.

156    I pause to note that whilst there is no doubt that the parties have the interests of the children at heart, it is unfortunate that their inability to co-operate has taken a toll on the children. The countless applications they have taken out against each other reveals a lack of insight on the damaging effect of their conflicts on the wellbeing of the children. They were unable to co-operate even in the preparation of the Joint Summary, which should not have been a contentious matter. The exchanges between the parties through their counsel leading to the eventual filing of the Joint Summary were unnecessarily adversarial and needlessly copied to the court. In this regard, I find it necessary also to remind counsel of the expectations under Rule 15A of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 to be constructive and conciliatory in the conduct of family proceedings.

157    Unless the parties are prepared to put their past grievances behind and work towards a path of restoration and healing, they will continue to be ensnared in litigation post-divorce. This endless cycle of conflicts does not augur well for the children or the mental, emotional and financial wellbeing of the parties themselves. I urge the parties to be receptive to the professional help that is extended to them through the DSSA.

158    Coming back to the issue at hand, it is trite that while the court is not precluded from considering the conduct of the parties in exercising its power to order the division of matrimonial assets under s 112(2) of the WC, the court only ought to have regard to conduct that is both _extreme_ (i.e, manifestly serious) and _undisputed_ for the purpose of ascribing a “negative contribution”: see _Chan Tin Sun v Fong Quay Sim_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGCA 2</span> (at \[25\]). As stressed by the Court of Appeal, the hearing of the ancillaries is not intended to be another forum for parties to dredge up accusations and allegations relating to each other’s conduct. In the present case, each of the party has accused the other party of abusive behaviour and sought to paint the other party in negative light. I did not find any of the allegations made by the parties against the conduct of the other party to be relevant or helpful to the determination of the division of matrimonial assets.

159    Having regard to all relevant considerations and taking a broad-brush approach, I accord a ratio of 50:50 to reflect the parties’ equal indirect contributions to the family.

## Average Ratio

160    Applying the structured approach, the parties’ average percentage contributions as derived from the parties’ direct and indirect contributions represented in tabular form would be as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="48.84%"> <col width="25.58%"> <col width="25.58%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Husband (%)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Wife (%)</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Direct contributions</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">77.6%</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">22.4%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Indirect contributions (both financial and non-financial)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">50%</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">50%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Average percentage contributions</b></p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>63.8%</b></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>36.2%</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

161    I have considered the guidelines in _ANJ v ANK_ (at \[27\]) on the circumstances that could shift the average ratio in favour of one party but found no compelling reason to do so on the facts before me. As the parties’ direct and indirect contributions are only two factors under s 112 of the WC (_ie_, s 112(2)(a) and (d)), I have further considered the other factors under s 112 and have, in this regard, given consideration to the Husband’s submissions for adjusting the average ratio in his favour.[^198] I do not find the reasons provided by the Husband to be sufficient to justify an adjustment to the average ratio. For example, he says the Wife’s rent-free period occupation of the matrimonial home since January 2015 should be taken in his favour, but it should be noted that he too had occupied the matrimonial home rent-free for a period of time. He says he has taken various loans for family and household expenses. Quite apart from the fact that the veracity of these loans is disputed,[^199] there remains the question as to why he has not obtained any proper employment since December 2018.[^200]

## Mechanism on division

162    The total value of matrimonial assets that falls for division is $700,601.83.[^201] The Husband is entitled to 63.8% and Wife is entitled to 36.2%.[^202] In actual quantum, the Husband is entitled to $446,983.97 and the Wife is entitled to $253,617.86. The Wife shall retain the assets in her sole name ($55,888.30)[^203] and the Husband shall retain the assets in his sole name ($147,543.53).[^204] There are two joint assets that are included in the asset pool – the car ($7,170)[^205] and the matrimonial flat ($490,000).[^206] The scrap value of the car shall be allocated to the Husband since the PARF and COE rebates were paid to him.[^207] The apportionment of their respective share in the matrimonial flat after all other assets have been divided is as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="49.92%"> <col width="25.04%"> <col width="25.04%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Husband</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Wife</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Husband’s Assets ($147,543.53)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$147,543.53</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">-</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Wife’s Assets ($55,888.30)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">-</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$55,888.30</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Car ($7,170)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$7,170</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>-</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Matrimonial flat ($490,000)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$292,247.47</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$197,752.53</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Total ($700,601.83)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$446,961.00</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$253,640.83</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

163    The Husband has proposed to buy over the flat at $122,500 based on his calculated ratio.[^208] Given the arrears in maintenance that the Husband owes,[^209] the large amount of loans he says he has taken from family and friends[^210] and the fact he has not received an income since December 2018 and is still unemployed[^211], I do not find his proposal to buy over the flat to be realistic. I find the Wife’s proposal to have the matrimonial flat sold in the open market and the sale proceeds divided to be a more practical way forward.[^212]

164    Based on the average ratio of 63.8 % (Husband) and 36.2% (Wife), the parties would receive $312,620 and $177,380 respectively:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="49.9100179964007%"> <col width="26.1347730453909%"> <col width="23.9552089582084%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Husband (63.8%)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Wife (36.2%)</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Matrimonial flat ($490,000)</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$312,620</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$177,380</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

165    As the Wife is entitled to receive $197,753 (rounded up) based on the overall division of the matrimonial assets, the Husband shall pay the Wife the difference of $20,373 ($197,753 - $177,380).

## Orders – Division of Matrimonial Assets

166    In the circumstances, my orders on the division of matrimonial assets are as follows:

> (a)     The matrimonial flat shall be sold in the open market within 6 months of the Final Judgment or such other date that parties may mutually agree.

> (b)     The sale proceeds, after deducing all costs and expenses incidental and relating to the sale of the matrimonial flat, shall be divided in the following manner: 63.8% to the Husband and 36.2 % to the Wife.

> (c)     The parties shall refund to their own CPF account all moneys utilised toward the purchase of the matrimonial flat including accrued interest from their respective share of the net sale proceeds.

> (d)     The Husband shall pay the Wife $20,373 from his share of the net sale proceeds.

> (e)     The order in sub-paragraph (c) above is made subject to the CPF Act and subsidiary legislation made thereunder. The CPF Board shall give effect to the terms of this order in accordance with the provisions of the CPF Act and subsidiary legislation made thereunder.

> (f)     Pending the sale of the matrimonial flat, the Wife shall be responsible for paying the service and conservancy charges and utilities for the matrimonial flat.

> (g)     The Registrar of the Family Justice Courts, under s 31 of the Family Justice Act 2014, shall be empowered to execute, sign or endorse all necessary documents relating to matters contained in this order on behalf of either of the parties, if that party fails to do so within 7 days of the written request being made to him or her. Each party shall retain all other assets in their own respective names.

> (h)     Liberty to apply.

167    The duty of counsel to assist the court includes where possible, informing the judge of any clear, uncontroversial errors in his or her decision, so that the judge can correct such inadvertent errors before the decision is appealed: see _BOR v BOS_ (at \[32\]). The parties should write to inform the court if they perceive any errors in computations within one week from the date of this judgment. This judgment is to be read subject to any such correction that may arise.

## Maintenance for Wife

168    The Wife submits that a maintenance sum of $300 should be granted to her. Since separating from the Husband, the Wife has endeavoured to be independent, which has been difficult due to her absence from the workforce while she was married and looking after the children. She now has a job, earning a gross monthly salary of $5,000 with a take-home salary of $3,391. In recent times, she has also faced medical difficulties and has undergone a surgical procedure to remove her endocervical polyps. The Wife therefore has to spare some thought to ensure that she has disposable income to meet any other future unforeseen medical expenses.[^213]

169    The Husband submits that the Wife is gainfully employed as a business development manager and is well capable of maintaining herself.[^214] He says that he is currently unemployed and whilst he is a director and shareholder in four companies, they are not profit-making, and he has not drawn any income since December 2018. He says the Wife has taken active and deliberate steps to tarnish his reputation and jeopardise his career. In the past, the Wife had utilised monies received by the Husband for the children’s maintenance for her own use and the Husband ended up having to bear the bulk of the expenses for the children anyway. Meanwhile, he has taken loans from family and friends for family and household expenses, as well as his monthly rent, which loans he is slowly trying to pay off. The Husband says he is focusing his time and energy on J’s studies to prepare J for his major examinations in 2020 and he will continue to find work meanwhile.[^215]

170    In is well-established that the court’s power to order maintenance is supplementary to its power to order a division of matrimonial assets: _BOR v BOS_ (at \[118\]). There is no duty on a former spouse of a party to be a general insurer of sorts to provide for the vicissitudes of life that the party may face: _ATE v ATD_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGCA 2</span> (at \[29\]). In the present case, it is clear that the Wife is capable of taking care of herself and in fact has been doing so since 2013 when she left the Husband. In addition, the share of the matrimonial flat that she has been awarded is substantially more than what she has put in from her CPF account. This means that after the sale of the matrimonial flat and the refund to her CPF account for the monies withdrawn towards the purchase of the matrimonial flat with accrued interest, she will still have a reasonable sum of monies to help her weather the transition of the divorce. For these reasons, I do not think any maintenance for her will be necessary. In addition, I note that the Husband is already owing the Wife a substantive amount of arrears of maintenance for the children. To make a further order of maintenance for the Wife given the poor state of the Husband’s financial health would serve only to aggravate their conflicts.

171    Given the above considerations, I order that there be no maintenance for the wife.

## Maintenance for child

172    Under an Order of Court dated 4 November 2016 _vide_ MSS 5535/2014, the Husband is pay $1,150 per month for the children’s maintenance ($520 is for J and $630 for K).[^216]

173    The Wife submits that the maintenance should be $1,600 per month ($800 for J and $800 for K) in order to meet the growing needs of both children and the additional tuition classes that they will need as they get older. J is in Primary 6 and will be completing his Primary School Leaving Examinations in 2020 and progress on to secondary school thereafter.[^217] The Wife says that although J has been living with the Husband from May 2018, prior to this, the Husband had been in arrears of maintenance.[^218]

174    The Husband submits taking into consideration his current means, the _status quo_ ought to be adhered to. The Wife has not alluded to any material change in circumstances. The Husband says that the current maintenance is based on the ratio of 60:40 for the expenses of J and K respectively.[^219] If he is the parent with care and control, he seeks a contribution from the Wife of 40% of the expenses.[^220]

175    The submissions of the parties are based on the assumption that they would be granted care and control of both children. However, I have considered that it would be in the interests of the children for the care and control of J to be with the Husband and the care and control of K to be the Wife at this time. It is possible for the court to order the Husband to contribute to the expenses for K and likewise for the Wife to contribute to the expenses for J. However, having regard to the intractable conflicts between the parties, I am of the view that a more practical arrangement is for each party to be solely responsible for the maintenance of the child under his or her care and control. This will help reduce the incidence of conflicts between them.

176    In the circumstances, I order that the Husband shall be responsible for the maintenance of J and the Wife shall be responsible for the maintenance of M.

## Costs

177    The parties are to bear their own costs of the AM hearing.
