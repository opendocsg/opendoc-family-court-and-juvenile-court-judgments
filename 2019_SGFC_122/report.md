Family law – Variation of maintenance for child and former spouse

6 November 2019

### District Judge Kathryn Thong:

1       This is the Defendant father’s appeal against my variation of the child and spousal maintenance orders in an ancillary matters order first made in March 2013. In sum, parties’ only child, Natalie, now aged 18 years, is pursuing a Science degree in Australia. For this reason, the Mother sought to vary Natalie’s maintenance.

2       With Natalie studying overseas, the homemaker Mother could no longer remain in Singapore as her residency permit was tied to Natalie’s student pass in Singapore. She intended to return to her hometown in Shanghai, with occasional visits to Natalie in Australia. Her plan was to rent premises in Shanghai and hence, she had to vary her maintenance as well.

3       Much of the contention arose from the Father’s perception that Natalie and the Mother had unilaterally chosen to pursue Natalie’s overseas education without regard to his views. He also believed that the Mother should get a job.

4       The Mother’s position was that the Father had prioritised his two young sons with his new wife over Natalie, and was simply being irresponsible in funding Natalie’s education.

5       At the hearing, the Father’s position was that he was ready to contribute towards 100% of Natalie’s tuition, living expenses and the Mother’s monthly maintenance. However, these amounts were on the low end, and in respect of the Mother, particularly derisory.

6       Eventually, I considered the standard of living that both Mother and child were accustomed to, as well as what would be reasonable, in arriving at SGD $1,850 per month as daily expenses for Natalie, and SGD $4,483.33 for the Mother inclusive of rental. The Father would separately pay for Natalie’s tuition and accommodation fees.

## Background

7       The 55-year-old Father is an engineer who hails from Denmark, and is earning some $23,500 per month (inclusive of housing benefits, bonuses etcetera). The 46-year-old Mother is from China, and has been a homemaker since parties’ marriage in 2000, save for a brief period where she gave Math and Chinese tuition, which provided her with additional income of some $800 per month. Parties were divorced in 2011. During the 11-year-marriage, the Father was the sole breadwinner.

8       The ancillary matters (“AM”) court ordered on 7 March 2013 that the Father pay a monthly maintenance sum of $2,000 each for both Natalie and the Mother. In so doing, the AM court found that Natalie and the Mother had both “enjoyed a certain standard of living and whilst they should not be extravagant, some padding should be accorded to the \[Mother\] who used to have access to the \[Father’s\] salary at will for a good part of the marriage”. At the time, Natalie was 12 years old.

9       The AM court also ordered that the Father was to continue to contribute a sum of $3,000 towards the Mother’s rental expenses, and Natalie’s school fees, so long as the Father’s employer provided him with the existing benefits. In sum, the Father was liable to pay a sum of $7,000 per month.

10     In addition, the AM Court ordered the Father to sell a property in Denmark solely owned by him, which estimated value back then was some $200,000 (before deducting the outstanding mortgage). The Mother would retain all of the net sale proceeds. However, to date, this property has remained unsold as the Father claimed the outstanding mortgage was higher than its value. According to the Father, as of 14 March 2018, the property was valued at a mere $40,000 with an outstanding loan of some $80,000.

11     Parties both filed appeals against the AM decision though it appears these appeals did not proceed further after the written grounds were released in April 2013. Shortly after the cross-appeals were filed, the Father defaulted in maintenance in May 2013, and the Mother garnished one the Father’s bank accounts. Subsequently, he consistently made payments until October 2018. Incidentally, the Father married his current wife in May 2013, the same month he first defaulted on his maintenance.

## The present applications

12     The Mother filed her summons for variation _vide_ SUM 49/2019 on 9 January 2019. She sought for the AM Orders to be varied to include the following:

> (a)     a one-off sum of $2,237 for Natalie’s overseas student health cover;

> (b)     a sum of AUD $10,000 for the pre-paid tuition fees (_i.e._ fees already paid up by the Mother);

> (c)     $2,000 for the Mother’s rental expenses in Shanghai from 1 February 2019;

> (d)     the sum of AUD$1,965 for Natalie’s rental expenses commencing 1 January 2019;

> (e)     AUD$51,869.33 annually for Natalie’s tuition fees, starting 4 March 2019 until 31 December 2019;

> (f)     Natalie’s master’s degree tuition fees and living expenses as supported by invoices;

> (g)     a sum of $5,691 for the Mother as maintenance with effect from 1 January 2019, and

> (h)     $5,245 as maintenance for Natalie until she completes her bachelor’s and master’s degree and is gainfully employed.

13     A month later, on 22 February 2019, the Mother filed an enforcement application _vide_ MSS 666/2019 for arrears of $29,000 owed by the Father. Some two weeks later, on 4 March 2019, Natalie commenced her university education in Australia (“the University”).

14     Two days later on 6 March 2019, the Father filed his summons for variation, _vide_ SUM 757/2019, praying amongst other things, that he pays the Mother $1,000 as maintenance, and pays directly to Natalie the sum of $2,000 as her maintenance. Should Natalie study at the University, the Mother was to pay half of the tuition fees. Should Natalie remain in Singapore or study in Denmark where Natalie presumably could enjoy free university education, then the Father would bear her tuition fees.

15     The parties’ variation applications were fixed for hearing together with MSS 666/2019. At the trial for MSS 666/2019, the Father conceded that he had deliberately withheld maintenance from the Mother and Natalie, because he wanted to compel the Mother to disclose where she and Natalie were residing then. Presumably, this was because the Father had discovered that the Mother had found cheaper rental accommodation than what the AM Court had provided for. Through SUM 757/2019, he sought to claw back this “excess” that came up to around $500 per month.

16     In any event, leaving aside the issue of withholding maintenance, the main event was the issue of parties’ respective variation applications. In the hearing before me, the Father claimed that he had never been consulted on Natalie’s tertiary education and he had told the Mother sometime in 2017 or 2018 that he could ill-afford to send Natalie overseas. He claimed to have suggested sending Natalie to Denmark where she could study for free.

17     The Mother countered that the Father had never once raised the prospect of pursuing tertiary education in Denmark, until these proceedings. In any event, it would not be feasible for Natalie to study there as the lessons are conducted entirely in the Dutch language, which Natalie was not familiar with.

18     The Mother’s view was that the Father was evading his obligations and had chosen to prioritise his two young sons over Natalie - his 5-year-old was attending a German preschool that cost him the Father some $35,000 annually.

## Counsel’s arguments

19     Counsel for the Father, Mr Alain Johns, submitted that given the joint custody order, the Mother ought to have obtained the Father’s express consent before enrolling Natalie in the University. He stressed that his client’s repeated pleas that he could not afford to send Natalie overseas had simply fallen on deaf ears, and the suggestion that she study in Denmark for free, ignored. There being no such express consent or agreement on Natalie’s tertiary education, the Father was under no legal obligation to pay for her tuition fees and maintenance.

20     Mr Johns pointed out that the Mother did not even pray in her own summons for a determination as to where Natalie should undertake her studies, something she ought to have done if parties could not agree on where Natalie was to study. This underscored the lack of consultation with the Father, and how the Mother and Natalie had simply “bulldozed” their way into the University without further regard to him.

21     In respect of the Mother’s maintenance, there was no basis for it to be varied either. He submitted that the Mother could resume being a private tutor as she once was during the marriage, and in fact, the Mother herself expected to gain employment given Natalie’s message to the Father that the Mother would try to secure a job.

22     Notwithstanding the positions taken by the Father that his consent had not been sought, he indicated that he was prepared to pay a sum of $450 for Natalie’s maintenance, $4,322 per month for her school fees and $1,000 to the Mother. He proposed the following breakdown:

23     While Mr Johns acknowledged that it would appear to be in Natalie’s interests to remain studying in the University, the Father simply could not afford this. Sacrifices would have to be made by all concerned should Natalie wish to study overseas. The Father’s position was that the Mother and Natalie would both have to work to support their expenses, and Natalie should also reduce her personal expenses, which the Father viewed as being unnecessary.

24     Mr Johns further pointed out that that the Father had since remarried and has two young children to support.

25     Counsel for the Mother, Ms Jennifer Fong, submitted that it was the Father’s duty to cooperate under the joint custody order. Given that the Father had simply repeatedly shelved discussions as to Natalie’s tertiary education, the Mother and Natalie could not wait for the Father’s agreement.

26     The University was the only university which had offered Natalie a place; NUS, NTU and Yale-NUS had rejected her, as did other foreign universities such as Imperial College. As the Father was clearly not providing any funds, neither Natalie or the Mother could be passive about her enrolment once the offer from the University came in. Otherwise, Natalie would have to give up her place and spend the next year applying other universities, which would only hold her back in being eventually financially self-sufficient. This would prejudice all involved, including the Father.

27     Natalie working part-time to support herself was also impractical as this would detract from her studies. Ms Fong pointed to the demands of Natalie’s full-time degree where the University stated that the commitment and workload was equivalent to that of a full-time job. Anything less, the University noted, would mean that students were unlikely to achieve their full potential.

28     As regards the Mother’s maintenance, Ms Fong pointed out that the purpose of maintenance was financial preservation and the standard of living the Father’s current wife enjoys, is similar to that previously enjoyed by the Mother. It would be difficult for the Mother to obtain a job given that she had left the workforce for some 11 years. She was now 47 years old - the retirement age in Shanghai is 50. It would be an uphill task for her to find a job in Shanghai, and the Mother also stated that her written English was not good, thereby hampering her employability.

29     Ms Fong also pointed out that the Mother has failed to receive her fair share of the matrimonial assets, referencing the Denmark property (see \[10\] above). She submitted that the Mother’s failure to receive her due share of the matrimonial assets had contributed to the Mother’s current financial situation, where she had to resort to borrowing loans from friends and relatives to finance Natalie’s tuition and pay the attendant fees for enrolling in the University.

## My decision

30     At the hearing, Mr Johns informed that his client was willing to bear fully Natalie’s tuition fees, which was at odds with the position taken in his written submissions, that there had to be _express_ consent from the Father as to Natalie’s choice of school, for him to pay towards Natalie’s education. Notwithstanding the Father’s willingness in this regard, I thought Mr Johns’ argument merited some discussion.

31     As a matter of general approach, my view is that absent an express order to the effect, it would be untenable to adopt the position that there be consent – and _express_ consent at that – on an intended course of action undertaken by a child, before a payer of maintenance pays anything. This would create a perverse incentive for payers of maintenance to refuse blithely their consent on major decisions in a child’s life, in order to avoid paying the necessary and attendant expenses. At the same time, there is something to be said of the proposition that a payer of maintenance should not be made to blindly pay for new or additional expenses he has not been informed of.

32     At \[8\] of _TAU v TAT_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHCF 11</span>, the High Court observed that:

> Where joint or no custody orders are made, both parents _must consult each other and co-operate_ to make the major decisions for the child. Such orders ensure that the child continues, even after the parent’s divorce, to have the guidance of both parents in his or her life. \[own emphasis\]

33     All too often, the care and control parent is blamed – rightly or wrongly – for failing to inform the access parent of events and happenings in a child’s life. However, where joint or no custody orders are concerned, it is clear to me that the responsibility for consulting and cooperation falls equally on both parents. Of course as a matter of practical realities, the care and control parent would usually be the one keeping tabs of, and being the first to know of a child’s significant life events or milestones. But being involved in a child’s life such that the joint custody order is meaningful and its purpose achieved, means that both parents are to be proactive, not just the care and control parent. It cannot be the job of the latter to ensure that the access parent has perfect information on the major events of a child’s life – the access parent has to be responsible for seeking such information too. In fact, one may suggest that precisely because the access parent does not live with the child, it behoves him or her to actively engage the child or care and control parent on developments and updates in the child’s life.

34     Particularly where expected milestones such as primary school registration, graduation etcetera are concerned, an access parent should exercise initiative and broach the topic for discussion, and not always expect the care and control parent to approach him/her to consult him or her first. This is because the access parent is in no less a position than the care and control parent, to know when such major life events will be arising, and has an equal right to start the consultation process.

35     In my view, generally, once there has been communication to the access parent of an impending life event or milestone or decision to be taken, the burden is then on the access parent to respond to those communications and offer his or her views and input. There is no need for the care and control parent to invite the access parent to proffer views – it is the entitlement of the latter and he or she should exercise that right without need for solicitation.

36     I found on the evidence that the various exchanges the Mother and Natalie had with the Father, had revealed genuine attempts to engage him on Natalie’s further education. However, the Father appeared to be indifferent towards her choice of school. This could be seen from the history of exchanges and events that transpired from 2017 onwards:

37     In messages after 27 September 2018, the Mother urged the Father to continue paying the maintenance and to be prepared to pay for Natalie’s university education. These messages went unanswered.

38     On 12 November 2018, the Mother messaged the Father the Melbourne admissions letter and Natalie messaged her Father that they needed to discuss her impending college expenses. The next day, Natalie asked for a deposit which she needed by end December. The Father’s reply was that he was upset that he was being made to bear everything and the information was only give to him recently. To this, Natalie apologised to the Father for the information being given to him at the last minute. In the meantime, the Mother paid the deposit of AUD $10,000 to the University.

39     In further exchanges with the Father, Natalie would repeatedly urge the Father to discuss her expenses and mentioned how worried she was. She remarked that the Mother will try to find a job and things needed to be sorted. The Father however, would defer discussions, giving reasons that he was having “issues”, “money and emotional wise”; that he was waiting for his wife to return from an overseas trip. Even when Natalie reasoned that his current wife had nothing to do with their need to discuss her expenses, the Father responded that his “wife is part of the process.” On Christmas Day, the Father told the Mother she could proceed to Court as nothing would change.

40     Still, exchanges continued between the Father and Natalie where Natalie would urge the Father to discuss her expenses, and the Father would lambast the Mother, but no discussion ever took place as to her expenses. Natalie eventually started ignoring the Father. On 11 January 2019, after Natalie did not answer a call from the Father, he messaged her: “You know you can study in Denmark for free?”

41     I found that there had been reasonable attempts made by the Mother to engage on the issue of Natalie’s course of study. At the very least, the Father would have known by October 2017 that Natalie was already in the exploratory stages of what course to pursue, as she had invited him to attend the university counselling session at her school. He did not deny receiving this message – his response was simply that he was overseas at the time.

42     Even if he could not attend the university counselling session, the Mother had also sent the Father invoices for the Bio-Medical admissions tests in October 2017, which were for entry into medical school. It was thus apparent that Natalie and the Mother were seriously contemplating the future of Natalie’s tertiary education, and they were inviting the Father to be a part of this exercise. Yet, the Father did not pursue these matters further.

43     Given the Father’s position that the Mother ought to have sought his express consent as to Natalie’s course of study, it is indeed surprising that he did not appear to follow up on the matter after his return from his alleged overseas trip.

44     Even months later in May 2018, when the Mother informed the Father that Natalie was offered a place in the University, he simply replied over Whatsapp that he was happy and proud of Natalie. Unfortunately, the Father was disinterested as to whether Natalie would indeed be heading to the University as seen by the lack of follow up.

45     It seems that in order to counter this impression of being nonchalant over Natalie’s education, the Father resorted to quite incredibly, disputing the authenticity of some of these messages in this hearing. No reason or basis was given as to why he disputed their authenticity and this seemed to be a feeble attempt to extinguish all traces of knowledge he had as to Natalie’s future plans. As he stated in one his messages on 27 September 2018 – he reserved the right of an ignorant. Indeed, the Father appeared content to be “wilfully blind” as to Natalie’s university education.

46     Once the Mother had initiated communications relating to Natalie’s university education, it was for the Father to actively engage the Mother and/or Natalie on the matter, notwithstanding that there may not have been, on evidence, an overt question from the Mother as to what he thought of Natalie’s future education. After all, as her father and having joint custody of Natalie, and having been responsible for Natalie’s education throughout her life, the Father had every right to be involved in the decision-making process and was expected to exercise such a right.

47     To belabour the point, if the Father was genuinely concerned over financing Natalie’s education, he should have flagged this up as soon as possible, explained the basis for his inability to pay, iterated this to both the Mother and Natalie at every available opportunity and ask Natalie or the Mother for viable alternatives.

48     Yet, the evidence clearly showed that he had never asked Natalie or the Mother about possible options of studying locally (which were not necessarily cheaper) or followed up with the Mother the outcome of the local university applications. There was not even mention of Natalie pursuing her degree in Denmark for free until this proceedings were commenced. Perhaps the Father had in mind the somewhat perfunctory comment he made to Natalie in January 2019, _after_ she had enrolled in Melbourne and was ignoring his messages – “do you know you can study in Denmark for free?” But that aside, the evidence did not reveal any discussions on this point.

49     And while he claimed to have raised the matter of being unable to send Natalie overseas “sometime in 2017 and 2018”, there was no evidence of this. Even if true, this appeared to be a one-off occasion and the fact that the Father could not even recall the year this was said, suggests that it was not of foremost importance to him. Besides, if he was indeed so concerned over financing Natalie’s tertiary education that he pre-empted the issue back in 2017 or 2018, it begs question as to why he was later much less proactive.

50     Now, I note that the formal admissions letter to University was only sent to the Father in November 2018 instead of July 2018 when Natalie first received it. It is my view that the Father could have been informed earlier, and he had reason to be upset that the information was sent at the eleventh hour, something for which Natalie promptly apologised for, even though she had nothing to do with it – these were communications between the Mother and Father.

51     This however, does not detract from my finding that the Father was hands off in relation to Natalie’s university education. In fact, even after he was aware of the admissions letter, the Father still did not endeavour to make any payment, and chose to be avoidant in discussing Natalie’s expenses. His bare assertion that he had no money simply stone-walled discussions that Natalie was hoping to have with him, and he even used his current wife as an excuse to put off discussions.

52     In these circumstances, it seemed somewhat rich for the Father to contend that he had no say in Natalie’s university education. It was apparent that given his actions or lack thereof, the Father was not in a position to contend that he had not consented to Natalie’s choice of school and hence, was not liable to pay for her education. By deliberately choosing to be ignorant and closing himself off to brokering meaningful discussions did not absolve him from liability and besides, he was well aware of where Natalie would be studying at the very latest, by November 2018.

53     And while the Father pointed out that the Mother did not seek a determination on whether Natalie ought to be permitted to study in Melbourne, neither did the Father take out such an application, which he was at liberty to do so. Instead, his response to the Mother’s application some two months later was to take out a downward variation of the AM orders as he claimed his income had fallen. I eventually dismissed the Father’s application, which Mr Johns, candidly acknowledged was “right”.

54     In the premises, Natalie’s decision to study in the University could not be said to be unreasonable, particularly when the Father chose not to posit viable alternatives, and the evidence showed that the local universities, NUS, Yale-NUS and NTU had rejected her, as well as other foreign universities she had applied to. In sum, the University was the only university she could attend.

### Natalie’s reasonable expenses

55     The question now turned to the reasonableness of Natalie’s and the Mother’s expenses.

56     Overall, I found many of Natalie’s expenses to be unnecessary and inflated. While I recognised that she enjoyed a relatively high standard of living whilst in Singapore, her new circumstances entail higher expenses in the form of higher school fees and accommodation.

57     At the time parties divorced, Natalie was 12 years old and would have had little, if any, control over her daily expenses. However, as an 18-year-old on the cusp of adulthood enjoying greater independence, she is expected to be financially prudent and spend reasonably and discriminately.

58     Certainly, the Father’s suggestion that she work part-time was clearly out of the question and fairly incredible, given the distraction it would pose to her studies. Further, the Father did not seem sensitive to the fact that Natalie was considering pursuing a medical degree after completing her undergraduate studies. This would mean excellent grades in the latter would be crucial to further her studies in medicine.

59     In relation to the accommodation, Natalie was already residing at an apartment she shared with another flatmate at $390 AUD per week as her half share of the rental. I was of the view that it would be in her best interests to remain at her current lodging; I did not think it would promote her welfare to uproot and move to cheaper accommodation for mere affordability’s sake. This would unnecessarily complicate her life, with her having to find new house/flatmates and familiarising oneself with the new location and plausibly devising new ways of reaching the school campus at their new location.

60     Further, it was my view that generally, wider latitude be afforded where accommodation is concerned as it is important for any student, particularly when one is in a foreign environment. A conducive environment to study and decompress would be in Natalie’s best interests. Her chosen accommodation was well within the range of estimates provided by the University, and appeared to fall within the mid-point of the spectrum, with $825 being on the upper limit for accommodation that was near or on campus. I thus ordered that the Mother furnish the Father with the rental agreement at least 1 month before the commencement of the tenancy and he would make the necessary payments, inclusive of any security deposit within 2 weeks of receiving the agreement/invoice for payment. All future accommodation would be capped at this rate.

61     For all other expenses, I reduced these as set out below:

62     It was puzzling why Natalie needed to eat out at a restaurant for lunch every day. Dining out three times a week for dinner was also baffling. This did not seem consistent with the lifestyle of an average student.

63     As for her groceries and cooking material, I found the expenses to be inflated and a budget of $600 ought to be sufficient for her cooking needs and meals. Besides, given that she had $600 for eating out, this meant that she had a total of $1,200 for meals, which comes up to $40/day.

64     In relation to expenses for the home, I found that the various components were essential. However, the house repair fee could be removed as it would largely be the responsibility of the landlord to repair any damage to the house. I disallowed expenses for the dog, as there was no demonstrable need for such a pet and if she was bent on rearing one, she can do so from her own savings.

65     In relation to her personal care, she had the benefit of the overseas health cover and I found that $350 would suffice. I did not see why she needed to change her toothbrush every 2 months; why she needed hair dye every 6 months or haircuts once a month. The estimates for make-up and skincare seemed on the high end, as one would not be buying cosmetics or skincare products every month. For clothing and shoes, I allowed $50 per month, given that there may be special clothing for various seasons of the year.

66     The Father agreed to pay Natalie’s school supplies on a per need basis. I ordered these to be paid upon request by her, subject to a cap of $500. I did not order that this be on a reimbursement basis, or on production of receipts. I hoped that this will serve as a means of communication between them. I did not allow miscellaneous expenses for entertainment, etcetera. as I was of the view that Natalie could use leftover funds from each category of expense for this.

67     As for air tickets for Natalie, I ordered that the Mother shall be entitled to book up to three return trips on economy class for Natalie per academic year, and be entitled to full reimbursement from the Father within a week from the Mother producing the receipts. The number of trips coincides with the school breaks and I was of the view that Natalie should be allowed to visit the Mother, particularly where she was going through a challenging period in her life.

### The Wife’s reasonable expenses

69     The Father contended that the Mother should live with her own parents in Shanghai instead of renting an apartment. I did not think this was reasonable; I accepted the Mother’s evidence that there were insufficient rooms in her own mother’s house, and that her mother was living with the Mother’s stepfather. The rental of $1,820 was not unreasonable in my view, given that this was Shanghai. This was also slightly over half of the rental of $3,000 that the AM court had ordered for both the Mother’s and Natalie’s accommodation. As Natalie would be flying over to visit the Mother in Shanghai and very likely staying there over the school vacation, it was appropriate that the accommodation ought to be for both Natalie and Mother.

70     The utilities bills and expenses for laundry appeared reasonable, as did the internet fee. I did not allow expenses for a helper as the Mother would be living alone most of the time. Likewise, I saw no reason to provide a budget for house repairs as this would generally be the responsibility of the landlord. I allowed $800 for food which came up to about $26 per day. This was not a lot by Shanghai standards. For entertainment, which the Mother clarified was for eating out and entry into paid venues, I allowed $200 as I was of the view that the Mother ought to cut down on such expenses in view that the Father would be bearing higher expenses for Natalie.

71     As the Mother had a potentially chronic skin condition requiring regular treatment, I allowed her claim of $200 for skincare, and $400 for general wellness such as spa, hair care and nail care. As for personal hygiene products, health care products, dresses and shoes, I accorded a sum of $300 globally which I felt was reasonable given that she was approaching her fifties and health would be of paramount importance. For avoidance of doubt, I did not see a need for this budget to be used on dresses and shoes but it was up to her how she wished to spend the money.

72     I allowed her claims for $50 dental fees and $250 for monthly skin disease treatments, given that she paying such an amount for treatment at the National Skin Centre. I also allowed $150 for her insurance. Her claim for transportation of $60 was reasonable.

73     I disallowed her expenses for her cat, for the same reason that I disallowed Natalie’s expenses for rearing a dog. While these were the family pets, I did not think it was reasonable given that the Father would be incurring high expenses for Natalie’s tuition fees and accommodation.

74     As for the gym, piano, personal enhancement and calligraphy classes, I disallowed such expenses as they would come under matters relating to her general well-being, which can be grouped together with items such as spa, hair care, for which a relatively generous budget was already accorded.

### Who should bear these expenses/maintenance

75     The Father pointed out that the Mother used to work as a part-time Chinese tutor and had a degree from France. She should thus be responsible for maintaining herself. Besides, Natalie had remarked that the Mother would try to secure a job to support herself and Natalie.

76     The Mother noted that the Father’s current 37-year-old wife is on a pass that allows her to work but she is currently not working. The Father’s present wife also has a full-time helper and the use of a BMW. This was a similar standard of living that the Mother herself had previously enjoyed whilst married to the Father. This was undisputed.

77     The Father’s monthly income is $23,567.26 and his expenses as follows:

78     In addition, the BMW was on hire purchase for which he was making monthly instalments of $1,374, and which estimated value he proffered, was $80,000. The Father also owed Standard Chartered Bank some $77,000, and Citibank some $70,000. He claimed these debts were incurred during his marriage to the Mother and his current wife was helping him manage the repayment of these debts/loans. He also claimed to give his wife a $500 monthly allowance .

79     I was of the view that the Father’s expenses were exorbitant. Notably, the Father had purchased the BMW for $112,667.00 on 10 August 2017, the same year that the Father claimed he raised the issue of being unable to finance Natalie’s tertiary education. The hire purchase agreement revealed also that the Father had made a down payment of some $45,000, with the remaining $67,600 being the “loan amount”. That the Father had a sum of $45,000 at his disposal in 2017, for a 5-year-old BMW, was inconsistent with his claims to be financially tight. Even if were true, there was no demonstrable need to purchase a BMW. Clearly, Natalie’s education and future ought to take precedence over a luxury purchase.

80     Evidently, the Father and his new family led a fairly lavish lifestyle which saw him shelling out $2,000 per month on food and $1,000 a month for entertainment with friends and colleagues. He also spent an astounding $620 on cigarettes. For reasons best known to him, his 5-year-old son is enrolled in a German pre-school which set him back $2,965 per month.

81     The Father is at liberty to provide a luxurious lifestyle for his new family, provided it is not at the expense of his maintenance obligations to the Mother and Natalie. Indeed, as the High Court observed in _George Sapooran Singh v Gordip d/o Md Garsingh_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 197</span> :

> \[34\]  It must be remembered and emphasised that remarriage is not a free pass to avoiding pre-existing financial obligations owed to the family from an earlier marriage. It seems settled law that remarriage _per se_ should and does not affect or compromise the pre-existing obligations that a husband owes to the wife and children from a previous marriage.

> …

> \[40\]  where an applicant expects sacrifices from the family from the previous marriage with no proportionate and corresponding adjustments by his new family, that would not in my view be reasonable. Further, where the husband has failed or refused to trim his own expenses so that he can “balance the books”, that would in my view not be reasonable conduct as well.… The husband, having placed himself in this position, has to moderate and modulate both his and the expenses of his new family and make reasonable efforts to find reasonable solutions in order to enable him to perform his obligations to both families.

82     In the present case, notwithstanding the Father’s (unmeritorious) claims of a reduced salary, there was clearly no effort, much less reasonable ones, to continue his obligations towards Natalie and the Mother. Given that I had dismissed his summons for a downward variation which Mr Johns conceded was correct, all the more, the Father had no reason to shirk from his existing obligations to maintain both Mother and Natalie. His low estimates proposed for Natalie and the Mother ignored their previous standard of living. While I recognise that some 6 years have passed since the AM Orders were made, and it has been some 8 years since the interim judgment was granted, the Mother and Father were married longer (_i.e_. 11 years) than they have been divorced. There is no basis for the Father to contend that their standard of living ought to be lower due to the passage of time, which seemed to be his implicit argument in arguing that the Mother and Natalie find work.

83     Particularly in cases where at the time of the divorce the mother was a homemaker, I do not think it reasonable for a former husband to contend that the mother should as a matter of course, find a job to support herself. This of course depends on the factual matrix. In any event, I found that the Mother would be hard-placed to find a job given her personal circumstances. Even if she did find a job, at most it might yield her the income of some $800 that she used to earn whilst giving part-time tuition during the marriage.

84     In the premises, I found that the Father should remain liable to pay the Mother spousal maintenance, and in the sum of $4483.33. On top of this, the Mother was allowed up to two round trips on economy class per academic year, to visit Natalie as I believed this would be in Natalie’s best interests.

## Conclusion

85     There was no basis to absolve the Father from liability to pay Natalie’s school fees and reasonable living expenses, as well as the Mother’s maintenance. The Father had always been responsible for maintaining the homemaker Mother and Natalie, and there was no reason why this should change with Natalie studying overseas and the Mother having to return to Shanghai. By choosing to be lackadaisical over Natalie’s choice of school, the Father could not now seek succour in the joint custody order to reason that his consent had not been obtained. Natalie’s and the Mother’s decisions were not unreasonable; the Mother returning to Shanghai was an incidental effect of Natalie studying overseas. Given that the University was the only one which had offered Natalie a place, it was the only option available.

86     I also ordered that the Father reimburse the Mother monies that she had already paid to the University, on an instalment plan. I declined to make orders pertaining to Natalie’s postgraduate studies as this was speculative.

87     While the sums ordered are not small, the Father still had the Dutch property which he could sell and in fact, should have done so some six years ago. The Father also had a penchant for paying up arrears at the eleventh hour, such as when he paid up the sum of $29,000 in arrears about a week before the hearing. I did not think there was much visibility on his finances, and his actions suggested that he did have certain funds at his disposal. That he conceded to transferring monies to his wife to keep them out of the Mother’s reach in case of further garnishee proceedings, did little to ameliorate this impression.
