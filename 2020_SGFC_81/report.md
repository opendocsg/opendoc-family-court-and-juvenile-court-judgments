Custody, care and control – Division of matrimonial Assets – Wife maintenance – Children maintenance

1 October 2020

### District Judge Nicole Loh:

1       Parties in this marriage were married for 22½ years until the Interim Judgment for divorce was granted. There are 3 children from this marriage. The eldest reached the age of majority during the divorce proceedings, therefore only custody and maintenance issues for the 2 younger children, a 20 year old son and a 18 year old daughter, remain before the Court. I heard and made orders for the Ancillary Matters for divorce on 16 September 2020.

2       I had also heard the contested divorce for this case and therefore had seen and heard parties in person prior to the Ancillary Matters hearing. There was also an appeal against the decision for the divorce in HCF/DCA 15/2019, which was dismissed. Some of the findings that I made in the contested divorce are relevant for the purposes of the Ancillary Matter hearing.

## Introduction

3       The ancillary issues which were contested between the parties are the following:

> (a)     Custody, care and control of the 2 younger children;

> (b)     Maintenance for the 2 younger children;

> (c)     Maintenance for the Wife; and

> (d)     Division of matrimonial assets.

4       I made the following orders:

> (a)     Parties to have joint custody of \[children\] with care and control to the Husband. Wife shall have liberal access with access to be arranged directly between herself and the children.

> (b)     Parties and children to attend DSSA Counselling.

> (c)     Husband to maintain the children solely.

> (d)     The matrimonial flat to be divided 62% to the Husband and 38% to the Wife.

> (e)     The Wife to have the first option to take over the Husband’s share of the flat. The Wife is to exercise this option in writing to the Husband’s counsel within 1 month of the other and the transfer shall be effected within 3 months from the date of the Final Judgment upon the Wife paying the Husband 62% of the market value of the matrimonial flat. The Husband shall refund his own CPF account for monies utilised in the purchase of the flat together with accrued interest. The Wife shall bear the cost and expenses of the transfer.

> (f)     In the event that the Wife does not exercise the option to take over the Husband’s share or the transfer is not effected within the ordered timeframe, the matrimonial flat shall be sold in the open market. The sale proceeds less cost and expenses of sale shall be divided 62% to the Husband and 38% to the Wife. Each party to refund their respective CPF accounts for monies utilised in the purchase of the flat together with accrued interest.

> (g)     Each party to keep all other assets in their own names.

> (h)     No maintenance for Wife.

> (i)     Wife to pay Husband cost fixed at $2,500 for the ancillary proceedings. Cost for the divorce and ancillary proceedings to be deducted from the Wife’s share of the sale proceeds on completion if the matrimonial flat or to be paid on completion if the matrimonial flat is to be transferred to her.

5       The Wife filed an appeal against all the orders set out in paragraph 4 above.

## Facts

### The parties

6       The Husband is 49 years old and works as a senior manager. The Wife is 45 years old and works as an accountant and private tutor.

7       Their son will turn 21 years of age in less than 1 year after the ancillary matters hearing and was previously serving National Service until April 2020 after being found unfit for service. He is currently not studying or employed. In 2015, a Beyond Parental Control order was filed by the Husband, which was agreed to by the Wife and their son was ordered to reside at Gracehaven for 24 months. However, due to various infringements at Gracehaven, he was transferred briefly to the Singapore Boys’ Home before returning to Gracehaven. He also committed an offence in December 2018 and is on probation until November 2020. He is currently also under investigations for a separate offence.

8       Their daughter is in a junior college and will be sitting for her ‘A’ level examinations. She does not present any behavioural or disciplinary concerns.

### Background

9       During the divorce proceedings, parties had described the beginning of their marriage in a similar manner. Both parties were working and it was agreed that they would pool their income together. The Wife would manage their family’s expenses and the Husband transferred his salary to her. When the children were born, they were cared for by a nanny until 2015 (the children would have been about 17 years old, 15 years old and 13 years old then). They returned home from their nanny’s home on weekdays around 9pm or when they were picked up by either parent.

10     The Husband later discovered that the Wife did not contribute her salary as agreed and she had incurred large credit card and bank debts in both of their names. This led to both parties becoming bankrupt in 2003. Despite the unhappiness between them over their financial issues and expenses, they both continued with their marriage and during the divorce proceedings, both parties described the Husband’s care for the Wife when she was ill.

11     A turning point came in 2010 when the Wife decided to absolve herself from all duties in caring for the family. In 2015, when the Husband filed for a divorce, the Wife changed her mind and started to try to re-involve herself in the Husband and children’s lives. Although this was denied by the Wife, this was a finding made at the divorce hearing and is further corroborated by both children’s individual accounts to their Child Representative. This divorce filed in 2015 was eventually withdrawn by the Husband as parties entered into a Deed of Separation instead. In 2018, he filed this second Writ for Divorce.

## Current living and care arrangements

12     All parties and their children currently continue to live in the matrimonial flat. The Husband and daughter share the master bedroom. The Wife occupies one bedroom. Their 2 sons share the third bedroom. During the contested divorce hearing, evidence showed that the parties slept in different bedrooms since 2011. The Husband initially slept with all the 3 children in the master bedroom until the 2 sons moved out to share the 3rd bedroom.

13     On 29 October 2018, parties reached an interim agreement, inter alia, as follows:

> (a)     Parties shall have joint custody, shared care and control of the children.

> (b)     The children will be at liberty to decide the principal address, which is currently the matrimonial flat.

> (c)     The Husband shall contribute the children’s maintenance of $500 per child with effect from 1 November 2018.

> (d)     The Wife shall continue to contribute to the children’s maintenance by purchasing groceries for the household and to provide dinner for them.

## Children issues

14     The issues of custody, care and control were contested by both parties. It was clear that their son and daughter had very different needs. In particular, their son is currently under probation and under investigation. I appointed a Child Representative in order to obtain full information from the schools, police, probation officer etc. to understand the son’s needs and issues. I also did not want the needs of the daughter to be overlooked due to parties’ obvious concerns over their son. I was ably assisted in my decisions relating to the children by the Child Representative’s submission in this case, which covered the issues that I had requested her to look into.

### Custody

15     The Husband asked for an order for joint custody. The Wife was silent in the written submissions on this issue. In her Affidavit of Assets and Means, she stated she wishes Court to grant her custody, care and control of the children.

16     There are clear communication and relationship problems between the parties. However, there is nothing on affidavits to show that as a result of this, joint custody is not in the best interest of the children. Even between parties, this was agreed in the interim and did not seem to pose any issues. I therefore ordered parties to have joint custody over the children and in addition, ordered them to attend counselling to assist them in their co-parenting ability.

### Care and control

17     The 2 minor children have led very independent lives from each other for a number of years and do not share a close relationship with each other. Therefore, I did not consider it important that both children should be under the care of the same parent. They do not rely on each other’s presence as a source of comfort or stability.

#### Son

18     The son has been exhibiting a number of behavioural issues for years and this is apparent from the legal proceedings he has been involved in. He was also discharged from national service partly due to this. He does not exhibit any particular stronger relationship with either parent. He is indifferent as to which parent he wants to live with, although eventually choosing to live with his father in the end. His wishes were based on his own assessment on who will either allow him the most freedom (his mother) or who can provide him with more finances (his father). I placed little weight on his wishes.

19     The Wife seeks care and control as she alleges that the Husband has been neglectful of their children by returning home late. She attributes the behavioural problems of their son to the Husband. She claims to share a very close relationship with the children and would be a better care parent. She also cast aspersions on the Husband’s behaviour of flirting with other women and having a girlfriend. I dismissed this specific allegation as there was no evidence of this and in any event, I am looking into the qualities that both parties have as a parent and not as a spouse so unless this negatively impacted the care of the children, I did not find this relevant.

20     In arriving at my decision to grant care and control of the son to the Husband, I considered the following:

> (a)     The son is 20 years old and will turn 21 within 1 year. He is likely to stay with whoever he chooses to, notwithstanding any order.

> (b)     Both parties have difficulties in controlling their son, as shown by the need to file for a Beyond Parental Control order in 2015 and their son’s continued brushes with the law since then to date.

> (c)     The behavioural issues are unlikely to be caused solely by the Husband’s late nights away from home. The Wife herself was also not home early. Even when she is at home, she does not appear to control or discipline their son but reports any misbehaviour to the Husband for him to discipline when this should be a joint parental duty.

> (d)     The Wife’s style of parenting is very permissive to the extent that she plays mah-jong with him and his friends although she is aware that he has a gambling problem[^1]. Instead of trying to correct any misbehaviour, she appears to enable him. The Husband is more insightful into their son’s issues and attempts to try to instil some ground rules to curtail their son’s unsavoury activities. Whilst he is successful to a limited extent, but effort is at least being made by him. The Husband would therefore be a better parent to reduce the problems that their son may get into.

#### Daughter

21     As previously stated, there are little issues with their daughter. Due to her age, I placed considerable weight on her preference. She clearly and consistently articulated her preference to live with her father. Although the Wife has claimed that the Husband had influenced the children, I did not find this to be borne out as their daughter’s responses to the Child Representative were candid and revealed she had considered and decided based on her own reasons. She is not at an age where she can be easily coached.

22     The Wife also submitted that it is undesirable for the Husband to be sleeping with their daughter. However, it is their daughter who has expressed her preference to remain in the same bedroom with her father than move to her mother’s bedroom. This has been the sleeping arrangement for many years and it may be that their daughter draws comfort from this familiarity. In any event, I note that sleeping arrangements can be reorganised, if there is a need to. The Wife did not seem to raise any issue with this sleeping arrangement all these years and this appears to be raised for the purpose of litigation only.

### Access

23     Neither party submitted extensively on this as they were both claiming care and control. However, in view of the age of the children, I would have made the same order, i.e. the access parent will have liberal access for such access to be directly arranged between parent and child.

## Maintenance for children

24     The Husband’s case is if he has care and control, he will bear all of the children’s expenses. If the Wife has care and control, he will contribute half of the children’s expenses. He estimates the children’s expenses to be $961 for their daughter and $886 for their son.

25     The Wife’s case is if she has care and control, the Husband is to pay her $1,500 per month. This is more than the children’s expenses based on her own list. If the Husband has care and control, she does not offer any maintenance for the children.

26     As I have ordered care and control for both children to the Husband, I ordered him to solely maintain the children, since that is their common position.

## Maintenance for Wife

27     The Wife claimed monthly maintenance of $1,200.

28     The Husband objected to any maintenance as she is self-sufficient. She has income from her employment and as a private tutor. The Husband submits an adverse inference ought to be drawn as the Wife has under-declared her income from giving private tuition.

29     The Husband’s monthly nett income is $4,498 (there is a direct loan deduction by his employer of $850 per month). I do note that his IRAS Notice of Assessment shows he receives a higher average monthly income.

30     The Wife’s monthly nett employment income is $3,278.50. She did not declare her income from giving private tuition and when asked in discovery, she claimed she earned $4,657 in year 2017, $8,341 in year 2018 and $5,825 for half of 2019. She provided a 3 page document[^2] which listed the bank transfers and cash received as tuition. The Husband submits that she should not be believed because she is out at night too often and therefore should be earning more than what she declared. I did not find that she has under-declared her tuition income based only on this fact that she is not home early. I accept that between January to July 2019, she received $5,825, therefore making it an average monthly of $832 as her tuition income. Therefore, the Wife has a total monthly average nett income of about $4,110.50.

31     The Wife listed her monthly expenses as totalling $2,014.14. Without even considering whether such expenses claimed are reasonable or justifiable, considering that the Husband is bearing all the children’s expenses and her nett income is $4,110.50, I ordered no maintenance for her. There would be enough income to meet her needs, even if she has to find a new home. I agreed with the Husband that she is self-sufficient and does not require maintenance.

## Division of Matrimonial assets

32     The Husband submitted that the matrimonial flat be divided 70% - 30% in his favour. In her 2nd Ancillary Affidavit, the Wife claimed 90% of the matrimonial flat. At the hearing, the Wife submitted that she is claiming 80% of the pool of matrimonial assets.

### Pool of Matrimonial Assets

### Indirect Contribution

35     The Husband claimed that he should be attributed with 80% for his indirect contribution. The Wife also claimed that she should be attributed with 80% for her indirect contribution. Both claimed they played a bigger part in caring for the children and paying for the household expenses.

36     Because of the different manners in which parties conducted themselves during the course of this marriage, I considered the marriage in 3 different timeframes. The first timeframe would be from marriage until 2010; the second timeframe is between 2010 to 2015 and the last timeframe from 2015 to the divorce.

#### From 1996 to 2010

37     During this timeframe, both parties were working and their children were born. They both had certain roles to play. The Wife managed their finances up to 2003 however, unfortunately this led to both parties being declared bankrupt. Both of them were involved in their children’s care although they had frequent arguments over the need for a nanny and certain tuition expenses. From 2003 to 2010, the Husband took over the finances of the family and credit must be given to him that he managed to discharge their bankruptcy status.

#### From 2010 to 2015

38     This period was when the Wife withdrew herself from being involved with the family. The Husband took over the care of the children as well as paid for all their expenses. I note that the children were in the care of the nanny during the weekdays who took care of their meals and washed their uniforms. The Father was the one who fetched the children to school and from the nanny’s home.[^3]

39     The Husband also described that he was the one who took the Children out for family events and holidays.

40     I believed the Husband’s account as the daughter had also recalled a period in which the Wife was quite hands-off with the children and then all of a sudden become motherly. This was also a finding I had made during the divorce proceedings.

#### From 2015 to divorce

41     After the filing of the first Writ for Divorce, the Wife started to involve herself with the family again. However, her attempts would be limited to the Children as the Husband considered them as being separated (and there is a Deed of Separation confirming they will be leading separate lives). It appears that the Husband continued to pay for most the children’s expenses (except where the Wife insisted on certain classes for the children). Her list of expenses for the Children in the Affidavit of Assets and Means also somewhat corroborates this as she does not list most of the monthly expenses of the children. Her counsel had also in making submissions with regard to wife maintenance, conceded that the Husband meets most of the children’s expenses. There is evidence of her seeking reimbursement of the Children’s expenses from the Husband and in addition, their interim agreement also provides for an allowance for her to continue buying groceries for the children. In other words, the bulk of the children’s expenses were still borne by the Husband. The children were likely left to their own devices at home after school and the Husband continued what he did as per 2010 to 2015 in terms of care save that the Wife may have been slightly more involved in trying to engage them more and was purchasing groceries and providing dinner.

42     In totality, considering the 3 periods, I find that the Husband has contributed more indirect contribution towards the family. I therefore attributed 65% of indirect contributions to him and 35% to the Wife.

### Adjusting weightage of contributions

43     The Husband submitted that indirect contributions should be given a higher weightage of 60% compared to direct financial contributions because it is a long marriage and the Husband’s efforts in working his way out of bankruptcy and the difficulties in caring for their 2 sons.

44     The Wife made no submissions on adjusting the weightage and also no further submission on how she arrived at her claim of 70% of the pool or 90% of the matrimonial flat.

45     I declined in adjusting the weightage as the Husband’s efforts are already recognised in his higher percentage in terms of indirect contributions. I also recognise that the pool of matrimonial assets might have been larger if the Wife did not mismanage the family’s expenses or contributed more directly for the Children, thereby enabling the Husband to grow the family wealth. As it is, she still has credit card debts that is more than her monthly income. However, all of this would have been taken into account by their direct financial contribution to the pool as well. There is no reason to adjust the weightage further. Therefore, I arrived at the final 67% \[(70.5% + 65%)/2 rounded down\] for the Husband and 33% \[(29.5% + 35%)/2 rounded up\] as their respective share of the pool of the matrimonial assets.

### Consequential division of matrimonial flat

46     The Husband’s share is therefore 67% of $1,388,432.96 = $930,250.08. The Wife’s 33% share is $458,182.88. After deducting each party’s respective assets, the Husband should receive $305,523.19 and the Wife should receive $184,476.81 from the matrimonial flat. This translates to 62% of the matrimonial flat for the Husband and 38% for the Wife. I accordingly ordered this and gave the Wife the first option to buy over the Husband’s share since she wanted to explore this.

## Conclusion

47     Whilst it is often cited in family matters that there is no winner or loser and cost orders may further worsen the relationship between acrimonious parties, I was of the view that cost was warranted in this case. I do not fault the Wife for wanting to have care and control of the Children as this is a natural desire of a parent. However, in the current case, especially in view of the report from the Child Representative, the Wife clearly does not have a good insight as to her relationship with the Children and their wishes. She continued to paint the Husband as being a bad parent despite his clear contributions to the children’s care.

48     For the issues of wife maintenance, children maintenance and division of assets, she put forth unreasonable claims which were not justifiable at all even based on her own evidence. Considering the time taken for the hearing, the number of affidavits filed, submissions done, I ordered the Wife to pay $2,500 for the ancillary proceedings. I was informed that the previous cost order I had made for the divorce hearing remained unpaid and to avoid further disputes or claims for recovery of debt, I ordered both sets of cost to be settled together with the transfer/disposal of the matrimonial flat.
