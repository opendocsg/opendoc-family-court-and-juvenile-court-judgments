Family Law – Matrimonial Assets – Division

8 March 2021

### District Judge Kenneth Yap:

1       The parties in this case consented to divorce and were able to agree amicably on child matters, with care and control to remain with the Wife and access to the Husband. At the ancillary matters hearing before me, orders were made for the division of matrimonial assets and maintenance. The Husband appeals only in relation to the division of assets.

## Background facts

2       Both parties were married in India on 27 October 2005. They came to Singapore on 6 November 2005 and purchased their first HDB flat in 2007. There is one child to the marriage, a son aged eleven years, born on 14 August 2009.

3       A brief exposition of the parties’ respective career paths is necessary to provide the context to their financial contributions.

4       The Husband is 45 years old. He was in salaried employment until 2009. Thereafter he struck out as an entrepreneur running a franchise of 7-Eleven stores under Cold Storage from 2010. He started with two stores in partnership with two of his friends. The partnership broke up within a year, and the Husband continued to run the franchise, which had grown to three stores, until it was terminated in 2013 by Cold Storage due to mounting debt of some $187,591.93[^1]. The Husband next started a newspaper distribution business as a sole proprietor. In the meantime, the outstanding sums owed to Cold Storage were arranged to be paid by instalments which were guaranteed by the Wife. However, the Husband defaulted on his monthly payments to Cold Storage from March 2016 until July 2016. This precipitated a civil suit against both the Husband and the Wife, which was only withdrawn in November 2016 after the Wife proposed a repayment plan.

5       The Defendant wife is aged 43 years and is an engineering graduate. She was working throughout the marriage. Due to the Husband’s debts, the Wife applied for unsecured loans in 2013, 2015 and 2016 amounting to $81,606.00[^2] to pay off the debt. The proceeds from the sale of the couple’s first HDB flat amounting to some $140,000 were also applied to pay off the Husband’s debts in 2014. Throughout the marriage, the Wife has remained gainfully employed, save for short periods in between jobs from January to February 2019 and from June to September 2019. She is currently working as a Consultant.

6       The marriage eventually broke down in 2016. The Wife left the matrimonial flat with the child in May 2016 to visit her parents in India over the school holidays, and upon her return, took up residence in a rental flat. From that point onwards, she had been solely maintaining the child and paying for her household expenses. The Husband commenced divorce proceedings on 15 February 2019 on the basis that parties had lived apart for a continuous period of three years. The Wife consented to the divorce and Interim Judgment was granted on 21 May 2019.

7       Both parties were able to reach an agreement on the child’s care and living arrangements through mediation. A consent order was granted on 20 June 2019 for parties to have joint custody of the child, with care and control to the Wife and access to the Husband.

8       On 17 October 2019, the Wife applied for variation of the consent order on the child’s access arrangements and also sought interim maintenance of S$1,000 for the child. This variation application was dismissed. Both parties were able to reach an agreement for the Husband to pay S$450 per month as interim maintenance for the child.

9       Parties were however unable to agree on the remaining ancillary matters and the hearing proceeded to the division of matrimonial assets and maintenance for the Wife and the child.

10     The matter was first placed before me for hearing on 9 September 2020. There were however serious disputes of fact as to key issues which required further factual evidence to be tendered. The first was the question of whether items of gold jewellery that had been pawned should constitute matrimonial assets. The second factual dispute that remained was whether the Husband had in fact rented out room(s) in the matrimonial home after the Wife and the child had vacated the premises. I adjourned the matter and directed parties to file further affidavits to address these issues, including their position on the ownership of each item of jewellery as well as the names of the occupants in the matrimonial home, the duration of such stay and the market value of such rental.

11     I heard the matter again on 16 November 2020 and 23 November 2020 and made the ancillary orders after reviewing all the evidence before me. I now provide the grounds for my decision as follows.

## Division of Matrimonial Assets

### Operative date to determine and value the matrimonial pool

12     The general position is that the date of Interim Judgment should be the starting point in determining the contents of the pool of matrimonial assets, and any decision to depart from this should be justified by cogent reasons, per _BPC v BPB and another appeal <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGCA 3</span>_ at \[26\] and _ARY v ARX_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 2 SLR 686</span> at \[31\], \[34\]-\[36\]. I did not find any reason to depart from this general position.

13     As for the value of the matrimonial pool, the values furnished by the parties were based on the values that were stated in their respective ancillary affidavits and parties were able to agree on the value of the assets (save for the disputed issues relating to gold jewellery and the alleged rental of the matrimonial home).

### Assets in Joint Names

14     Parties agreed that there was only one joint asset, which was the matrimonial flat located at Rivervale Crescent. Parties also did not dispute the net value of the flat, which is set forth in the table below: -

#### Indian Property (Plot No. 57) and Indian Property (Plot No. 68)

17     The parties were however unable to agree on two issues in relation to the Wife’s assets. The first area of dispute related to two plots of Indian Properties, namely Indian Property (Plot No. 57), which was previously held in the Wife’s sole name but had subsequently been sold off, and Indian Property (Plot No. 68), which remained in the Wife’s sole name.

18     The Wife averred that Indian Property (Plot No. 57) was purchased on 30 May 2013 for about S$59,000 and was sold at S$19,000 on 28 June 2018. As the mortgage at the time of the sale was S$26,000, she had sustained a further loss of S$7,000 which she had to pay to discharge the loan. The Wife submitted this ought to be accounted for by deducting the same from the matrimonial pool.[^14] In relation to Indian Property (Plot No. 68), which had not yet been sold, the Wife’s submitted that while its market value was S$15,658.10, the outstanding mortgage loan on the said property was S$25,857.40.[^15] Accordingly, she took the position that the Indian Property (Plot No. 68) represented a net liability amounting to S$8,903.82 which should be deducted from the matrimonial pool.

19     The Husband argued in respect of Indian Property (Plot No. 57) that while the Wife was the legal owner, his father had paid for the bulk of the purchase price of the said property and had commenced proceedings in India to claim these sums from the Wife upon her sale of the property[^16]. By this count, the Husband disagreed that the property should be added to the matrimonial pool. With respect to Indian Property (Plot No. 68), the Husband argued at the hearing that the loan should not affect the value of the Indian Property (Plot No. 68), and that the said property should be ascribed its market value without regard to the outstanding mortgage loan. Instead, the loan incurred by the Wife could be accounted for as part of her indirect financial contribution.

20     I took the view that since the Indian Property (Plot No. 57) had been sold in June 2018, which was prior to the date of Interim Judgment 21 May 2019, it could no longer be said to count towards the matrimonial pool. Where an investment had been realised prior to the date at which the matrimonial pool is determined, the profit or loss should lie where it falls, and should not be apportioned separately to the favour or detriment of one spouse. To do so would effectively insulate the spouse from the effect of the profit or loss, by making separate account to the spouse for this component in the exercise of division.

21     As for the Indian Property (Plot No. 68), I note the Wife’s position that the outstanding mortgage on the said property was more than its market value and that the property was therefore a negative-value asset which should be reflected as such in the matrimonial pool. I saw no basis to support the Husband’s contention that the asset value of this property should be added without regard to the outstanding mortgage liability. This would effectively apportion the loss in the value of the investment solely to the Wife, which was bereft of any basis in principle or fairness.

### Loans Incurred by the Wife to repay Husband’s business debts

22     The Wife took the position that the loans she had taken out in her sole name and repaid on account of the Husband’s business debts should be accounted for in the determination of the value of the matrimonial pool. According to the Wife, she had borrowed monies amounting to S$81,606 from various banks during the marriage to help the Husband when his franchise business ran into financial difficulties. After applying the sale proceeds for the sale of the family car amounting to S$8,500 towards these loans, she had to fork out an additional sum of S$73,106 from her personal monies towards repayment[^17]. Some of these payments came from her monthly salary. However, in order to avoid the high interest rates that the banks were charging, the Wife turned to her siblings, parents and friends and borrowed money from them in order to repay the banks.[^18] In turn, the Wife would repay her family and friends in instalments.[^19]

23     The Wife submitted that the loans that she repaid using her own monies for the Husband amounting to S$73,106 ought to be credited to her as part of her indirect contributions to the marriage.[^20] She further submitted that the amount of S$73,106 was a liability that she had incurred for the Husband and should be discounted from the total amount of assets held in her own name.[^21]

24     The Husband disagreed with the Wife’s position. He argued that he had repaid the loans for his franchise business by himself, and that the Wife had only taken out the loans from various banks to fund her younger brother’s family’s purchase of property, her younger brother’s personal activities and her father’s loan shark business.[^22]

25     In respect of the S$73,106 that the Wife sought to deduct from the matrimonial pool, I took the view while these loans were taken out by the Wife solely to assist the Husband in repaying his business debts, the point remains that they had been discharged and were no longer outstanding liabilities by the date of Interim Judgment. In my view, they should properly be characterized as efforts undertaken to support the common endeavour of marriage. If the Husband’s business ventures had turned profitable as a result of the Wife’s support, the Wife would conversely enjoy such gains as part of the matrimonial pool to be divided. Accordingly, the sacrifice she had made in the course of the marriage to cover her Husband’s business losses should likewise be regarded as a contribution that had been fully spent in the course of marriage. This accords with the general principle that a marriage constitutes an economic union under which the gains as well as losses are to be shared, a view espoused by the Court of Appeal in _ATT v ATS_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGCA 22</span>, at \[11\] and \[12\]: -

> 11.    … A marriage is in part an economic union in which each spouse’s financial well-being is entwined with one another. Just as gains are shared, so should the losses. It cannot be the case that appreciating assets fall to be divided as part of the common pool whilst depreciating asset or liabilities incurred in seeking to enhance the wealth of the family are attributed entirely to the investing spouse.

> 12.    … The passive spouse must take the good as well as the bad, unless that spouse can show that the losses were not incurred bona fide or for some other good reasons should not be treated as a loss of the family.

26     In _ATT v ATS_, the issue was whether the Husband’s outstanding trading liabilities of $700,000 should be borne solely by the Husband when determining the pool of matrimonial assets. The Court of Appeal held that it should not, and would stand to be counted as a liability under the matrimonial pool. While the present case is different in that the liability had been fully discharged by the Wife’s efforts, the principle nevertheless holds true. The gains and losses of economic endeavor under the marriage must be borne jointly by both spouses as long as it was incurred in the course of the marriage. Indeed, that is the premise inherent in the marriage vow when one spouse commits to the other “for better or for worse”. For the Wife to recover the sums she had paid to bail out the Husband from his business debts would be to affix the burden of such losses solely on his shoulders. This runs contrary to the premise of a joint economic union articulated in _ATT v ATS_, and would be very much inimical to the central promise of the marriage vow.

27     By way of postscript I would add that the circumstances may be different if the matrimonial assets had been _dissipated_ by excessive or wasteful expenditure to the extent that matrimonial assets have been unfairly or unjustly depleted by the unacceptable actions of that party. The High Court in _AJR v AJS <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGHC 199</span>_ stated at \[6\] that in such a situation, the court has a discretion to decide whether or not to require such a wasteful dissipation of matrimonial assets should be accounted for in whole or in part by the spending party, in order to make the eventual distribution of matrimonial assets just and equitable for the innocent party. However, this was not the case in the present matter. Rather, this was a case where the Husband had genuinely entered into business ventures with the hope of striking out on his own but had ultimately failed in the attempt.

28     Accordingly, the losses incurred by the Wife in repaying her Husband’s loans should lie where they fell. However, they should be taken into account as part of the Wife’s indirect contributions towards the marriage.

### The Husband’s Credit Card and Credit Line liabilities

29     The Husband had liabilities in his sole name amounting to S$56,231.18 comprising of debts from credit card spending and credit lines.[^23]

30     During the hearing, the Wife argued that these liabilities were incurred solely by the Husband and had nothing to do with her. She asked that the Husband be held solely responsible for the S$56,231.18 and submitted that these liabilities should not be included in the matrimonial pool. As there was no explanation by the Husband how these liabilities had been incurred, and given that parties had separated in 2016, I took the view that these liabilities should not be deducted from the matrimonial pool and should lie where they fell; i.e. to be borne solely by the Husband.

### The Wife’s Credit Card and Credit Line Liabilities

31     The Wife stated that she often had to draw from her credit card / credit line to pay for her own personal expenses, including her legal fees, amounting to S$21,630.03.[^24] The breakdown provided by the Wife is reflected in the table below.[^25]

32     The Wife therefore sought to reflect the sum of S$21,630.03 to be deducted as a liability from the total amount of assets held in her sole name. Effectively, this meant that she would be indemnified for the full extent of the debts she had incurred under her credit cards and credit lines.

33     I took the view that since these debts had been incurred by the Wife for her sole benefit and as they were incurred after divorce proceedings had commenced, they could not be said to be matrimonial liabilities and should not be deducted from the matrimonial pool. This is in line with the Court of Appeal’s decision in _Wan Lai Cheng v Quek Seow Kee and another appeal and another matter <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGCA 40</span>_, at \[67\]:

> 67.    As a matter of principle, _once divorce proceedings are commenced_ and the likelihood of the issue of dividing matrimonial assets arise, neither spouse should be allowed to dispose or incur liabilities on these assets for his or her _sole benefit_ to the detriment of the other spouse. A spouse who does so will be _solely liable_ for the liabilities incurred …

34     Accordingly, I declined to deduct the credit card and credit line debts from the matrimonial pool as these were incurred solely by the Wife for her own benefit.

### Rental Proceeds collected by the Husband

35     Parties were in dispute over whether rental proceeds had been collected by the Husband for leasing out bedrooms in the matrimonial home when the Wife and the child vacated the said premises in May 2016, and if so, whether these rental proceeds should be accounted for when determining the division of matrimonial assets.

36     The Wife argued that the Husband had leased out one bedroom when she and the child had vacated the matrimonial home in May 2016. In particular, the Wife stated that the Husband had rented out the master bedroom to a family of three, consisting of a couple and a child, and had also rented out another bedroom to a male individual.[^26] While the Wife did not have any evidence to support her claim, she mentioned that the child had seen these tenants whenever the child went over to the matrimonial flat to have access with the Husband.

37     The Wife stated that the Husband must have collected rent from these tenants as it was unlikely for the Husband to provide free accommodation and utilities to them.[^27] She alleged that he must have been utilised towards his personal expenses, the household expenses as well as the child’s expenses.[^28] She also argued that the Husband must have also utilised the rental proceeds to pay for the monthly cash mortgage of the matrimonial home of S$1,785, which he would not otherwise have been able to afford.[^29]

38     The Wife claimed that during the marriage, parties had rented out one and, at times, two of the bedrooms and had collected S$450 per month per bedroom.[^30] She estimated that the Husband would have received about S$1,300 per month from rental, being S$800 and S$500 for each bedroom.[^31]

39     The Husband did not deny that there were other occupants of the matrimonial flat but he denied collecting any rent. As the Husband did not provide any information on the identity of the occupants and the duration of their stay, I directed that he file an affidavit to clarify the same.

40     In his further affidavit, the Husband explained that when the Wife and the child left in May 2016, his family members took turns to stay with him to look after him. From July 2016 to August 2016 to, his mother flew over from India to stay with him. When she returned, the father came over to reside with him from December 2016 to January 2017. He lived alone from January 2017 to April 2017.[^32] Thereafter, from April 2017 to January 2018, the Husband’s friend, one Mr K and his family including his wife and his daughter, resided at the matrimonial flat on the Husband’s father’s instructions to look after the Husband. The Husband explained that he did not collect any rent as Mr K was a family friend.[^33] After Mr K and the family moved out in January 2018, the Husband stated that he resided alone until May 2018 when his friend Mr B moved in until June 2018. He claimed that no rent was collected as it was a short stay.[^34] Thereafter, the Husband resided alone until November 2019 when his fiancée moved in to stay with him. There were no other occupants in the matrimonial flat from that point onwards.[^35]

41     I found that there was no clear evidence that the Husband had collected any rental income over the relevant period or signed any tenancy agreement with the various occupants who had resided in the property. In the absence of any concrete documentary evidence indicating the quantum of rental that the Husband had collected, I declined to require the Husband to reimburse rental proceeds to the matrimonial pool. However, I took note that it would be appropriate to consider the Husband’s rent-free accommodation since May 2016 as a relevant consideration when determining the division of matrimonial assets using a broad brush approach. This is in line with s 112(2)(f) of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353) (the “WC”), which provides that the court shall have regard to any period of rent-free occupation enjoyed by one part in the matrimonial home to the exclusion of the other party, in arriving at the just and equitable division of matrimonial assets between parties.

42     On a separate note, I did not agree with the Husband’s argument that the Wife had left the matrimonial flat with the child on her own accord and that she had not been forced to leave. Given the circumstances that the Wife had to face at home[^36], it was understandable that the Wife felt it necessary to leave, and no credit should be given to the Husband for arguing that she had moved out voluntarily. In any case, the question of whether the vacating party had been forced to leave is not a relevant consideration, in line with the High Court’s decision in _TRS v TRT_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHCF 3</span>, at \[15\]:

> 15.    … However, rent-free occupation, in its plain and ordinary meaning, means that one party occupies it to the exclusion of benefits to the other. Importantly, such exclusion does not have to be forced. The only question is whether or not the Husband did _in fact_ occupy the matrimonial home exclusively … and the answer appears to be yes.

43     Given that the Husband did in fact enjoy rent-free occupation of the matrimonial home to the Wife’s exclusion, this should be taken into account as a factor towards the final division of matrimonial assets.

### Gold Jewellery

44     Both parties were locked in dispute over the issue of whether a collection of jewellery which had been pledged to Moneymax should be added to the matrimonial pool for division.

45     Section 112(10) of the WC provides that any asset acquired by one party by way of gift would not fall within the definition of a matrimonial asset, as long as it had not been substantially improved during the marriage by any party. As such, the jewellery that was acquired by way of gift to one spouse only or to the child would be excluded from the matrimonial pool. However, the jewellery that was purchased during the marriage by the couple would fall within the definition of a matrimonial asset and should be added to the matrimonial pool.

46     The Husband argued that all the gold jewellery belonged to him as they were gifted to him by his family members. These claims were supported in affidavits tendered by his parents.[^37] The Husband therefore submitted that the gold jewellery were gifts which fell outside the scope of the matrimonial pool.

47     The Wife however disagreed with the Husband’s position that all the gold jewellery belonged to him. The Wife argued that it was illogical for the Husband to be in possession of the family’s gold when the family members were residing in India.[^38]

48     Instead, the Wife explained that she had purchased several items of gold jewellery before and during marriage and had similarly received some jewellery from her parents at the time of the marriage. She also stated that she had jointly purchased some jewellery items with the Husband and had similarly received gifts from both her parents and the Husband’s parents that were intended for the child.[^39]

49     The Wife provided her position in response to a list of the pledged gold jewellery as to whether each item was obtained by gift, or whether it was jointly acquired by both parties[^40]. The following table summarises her position: -

50     From the above list of 25 items, the Wife essentially narrowed down the list to one item which she claimed should be added to the matrimonial pool (item number 6), and six items for which she would need to have sight of (items number 9, 10, 11, 16, 17 and 22) in order to ascertain how they were obtained. With regard to the remaining items, the Wife accepted that those items gifted by her parents and/or relatives should belong to her, while items gifted by the Husband’s parents and/or relatives should belong to him.[^41]

51     The Wife noted that the Husband had pledged all these items of jewellery for loans to pay his debts. In particular, from 2013 to 2016, the Husband had even re-pledged the jewellery to obtain further loans when his financial troubles were mounting as a result of his failed business ventures.[^42] In total, the Husband had received S$48,800 for all the pledges that he had made.[^43] The Wife was also uncertain whether the pawned jewellery had been redeemed or whether they still remained at the pawnshop.

52     Given the factual dispute between the parties, I adjourned the matter and directed that the Husband allow the Wife to inspect the six units of gold jewellery for which the ownership was unclear on her part. The Husband was also invited to include in his further affidavit any pertinent facts as to the ownership of the six items of jewellery. Based on the correspondence subsequently provided by the Husband on 29 September 2020 from the pawnshop, it transpired that all six jewellery items (items number 9, 10, 11, 16, 17 and 22), had been redeemed by the Husband.[^44] The Husband also revealed that the six jewellery items (items number 9, 10, 11, 16, 17 and 22) had been sent to India and returned to his parents.[^45] The Husband’s counsel further confirmed by way of letter dated 18 November 2020 that all the jewellery had been redeemed from Moneymax in January 2020, and that the items had all been returned to the Husband’s father.

53     At the outset, I was unconvinced by the Husband’s position that _all_ of the jewellery was loaned to him by his parents in India in order to pawn in Singapore to repay his business debts. The mother’s affidavit in this regard contains merely a bare assertion. No receipts of purchase were provided (based on the explanation that the items were all ancestral jewelleries[^46]), nor was there any explanation why the trouble was taken to transfer the jewellery physically to Singapore to be pawned here, instead of being pawned in India and having the money wired directly. Finally, the Wife was also certain that some of the items in the list were those gifted to her by her family during the wedding, and had even provided wedding photographs exhibiting such jewellery. Yet by the Husband’s explanation, none of these pawned items were gifts received during their wedding. It seems highly unlikely that during their time of need, the couple would not first pawn their own jewelry, but instead rely on ancestral jewellery provided by the Husband’s family. Even if this were so, it remains an open question where the wedding jewelleries ended up, if they were not pawned as part of the efforts to repay the Husband’s debts.

54     I was further perturbed by the fact that the redemption of the jewellery was only made known by the Husband at the eleventh hour in the hearing. The Husband only came clean on the redemption of all the jewellery in his counsel’s letter dated 18 November 2020, _after_ the ancillary matters hearing had commenced on 9 September 2020. It was noteworthy that the Husband had filed his second and third affidavits of assets and means in March and July 2020 respectively, and had made no mention of this fact therein. He had also raised no objection when the court directed the inspection of the disputed items of jewellery at the hearing on 9 September 2020, which would have been futile since the items had at that point been fully redeemed and sent back to India. As his disclosure came at such a late stage of the proceedings, it would have delayed proceedings inordinately to require inspection and valuation of the disputed items in India in order to ascertain the true ownership and value of each item. The need to conclude the proceedings was also pressing in view of the Husband’s own application under SUM 3321/2020, which sought to extract final judgment in advance of the conclusion of ancillary proceedings on the basis that the Husband needed to marry his fiancé urgently.

55     Given the circumstances, I found it impractical to wait for a full accounting exercise in relation to the jewellery which had been spirited back to India. As the Husband’s late declaration of the redemption and the urgency brought about by his need to remarry had rendered an accurate account impossible, I exercised discretion to adopt a broad brush approach and consider that the jewellery be excluded from the matrimonial pool, although a significant proportion of its value would be apportioned as part of the Wife’s indirect contribution towards the Husband’s debts. As the total amount of gold jewellery added up to almost 400g worth of gold, and at the market rate of S$70,000 per kilogram of gold, the highest estimate of the pledge value of the jewellery would have been about about $28,000.

### Application of the ANJ approach: Step 1: Direct contributions

57     Given that both parties were gainfully employed for most of the marriage, I considered this to be a dual-income marriage and applied the structured approach in _ANJ v ANK <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGCA 34</span>._

58     With respect to the direct contributions, both parties agreed that the assets held in both their respective sole names were almost similar and as such, the focus for determining parties’ direct contributions would be the matrimonial flat.

59     The Wife averred that the cash down payment for the Rivervale Crescent amounting to S$5,000 was paid using the monies that parties had received from the sale proceeds of their first matrimonial home.[^47] She proposed for the S$5,000 to be credited equally to both party.[^48]

60     With respect to the monthly mortgage, based on the Wife’s CPF Property Statement, she had utilized a principal sum of S$77,597.50 as at 23 March 2020 towards the purchase of the said property.[^49] No further cash contributions were made by her.

61     As for the Husband, he had utilized a principal sum of S$121,982.36 as at 21 May 2019 towards the purchase of the matrimonial flat.[^50] Thereafter, as the Husband did not have enough funds in his CPF account, he paid for the monthly mortgage of S$1,782.93 by way of cash.[^51]

62     Both parties agreed to adopt a ratio for direct contributions based on the monies paid towards the purchase of the matrimonial flat. It was agreed that this figure would be 64:36 in favour of the Husband, on the following basis: -

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="31.58%"> <col width="37.24%"> <col width="31.18%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Plaintiff Husband</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Defendant Wife</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Down payment (Cash)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">S$2,500</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">S$2,500</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Monthly mortgage (CPF)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">S$121,982.36</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">S$77,597.50</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Monthly mortgage (Cash)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">S$20,000</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">-</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Total</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>S$144,482.36</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>S$80,097.50</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>64%</b></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>36%</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

### Application of the ANJ approach: Step 2: Indirect contribution

63     The Husband argued that the indirect contribution should be 58:42 in his favour. He stated that he was a responsible husband and father who tended to the Wife’s and the child’s needs and ensured that they led a comfortable life. He mentioned that during the marriage, he had paid for food, swimming classes, badminton classes, the child’s clothes, toys, bags, shoes, entertainment and had also paid for the Wife’s mobile and internet lines.

64     I questioned the basis for the Husband’s submission especially since the Wife had been the primary caregiver of the child and had earned equal or more than the Husband throughout the marriage. At the hearing, Counsel for the Husband conceded and took the view that his client was willing to accept an equal ratio for indirect contribution.

65     The Wife disagreed with the Husband’s position and argued that her indirect contribution should be at least 80%. She raised the following arguments[^52]: -

> (a)     The Wife argued that she was the major contributor towards the family’s finances as she drew a much higher salary as compared to the Husband throughout the marriage. She highlighted that the Husband was job-hopping and earned substantially lesser than her until he started his own business;

> (b)     The Wife had taken out substantial amounts of loan amounting to S$81,600 as requested by the Husband when his business failed. The Husband had even utilised the sale proceeds from their first matrimonial home to pay off his debts. This amounted to approximately S$140,000. Finally, the Wife highlighted that he had pawned off her jewellery to pay his debts;

> (c)     As a result of the Husband’s indebtedness, the Wife had to pay for most of the household expenses including the child’s expenses. She had to take out loans and even turn to her parents for help;

> (d)     The Wife solely handled the child’s education, such as coaching the child, enrolling him in enrichment and tuition classes, attending the child’s school activities such as parent-teacher meetings, and looking after the child’s physical, emotional and medical needs.

> (e)     Even though parties had engaged a domestic helper from 2009 to assist with household chores, the Wife was the primary caregiver for the child and remained as such after they left the matrimonial flat in May 2016.

> (f)     After the separation, the Wife continued to look after the child and support the child financially by paying for his share of the accommodation, daily expenses, and high school fees. The Husband had only started visiting the child in April 2017 and started contributing S$450 per month towards child maintenance in December 2019;

> (g)     The Husband had enjoyed rent-free occupation of the matrimonial home since May 2016 to the exclusion of the Wife.

66     Counsel for the Wife also referred me to the cases of _TYS v TYT <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 244</span>_ and _TPD v TPE <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGFC 75</span>_, where the courts had awarded the ratios of 75% and 70% as indirect contributions on the part of the wives in a 17-year and 9-year marriage respectively. It was submitted that those cases similarly involved dual-income marriages with children, in which the wives took the role as the primary caregiver as the husbands were heavily involved in work.

67     The Wife further submitted that while she had similarly contributed significantly to the family, she had gone over and beyond the contributions made by the wives in _TYS v TYT_ and _TPD v TPE_, as she had incurred a huge debt for the Husband when his business venture failed, and continued to support the child financially despite the mounting debts that she faced. Accordingly, she submitted that a ratio of 80% in her favour would be appropriate.

68     I considered both parties’ submissions carefully and found myself unable to agree with the Husband’s position of equal ratios in respect of indirect contribution. This was a marriage of 14 years up to the time of the Interim Judgement. The Husband conceded that the Wife had always been the primary caregiver of the child since he was born. Despite the Wife working full-time with a demanding job, all the caregiving responsibilities fell squarely on her. The Wife was a hands-on parent who was actively involved in the child’s development. Any assistance from the Wife’s parents would be minimal given that they were not resident in Singapore.

69     Even though parties had a domestic helper for a period of time, I accept that this did not necessarily reduce the Wife’s contributions to the marriage. Given that both parties were working, it is not uncommon for parties to rely on external help to maintain the household. To my mind, the Wife’s contribution as the primary caregiver of the child was clear and indisputable.

70     Throughout the marriage, the Wife had been drawing a higher salary than the Husband and would therefore be in the position to contribute a larger financial share towards the household expenses and the child’s expenses. The Wife had also highlighted the fact that the Husband consistently changed jobs and was not able to ensure financial stability for the family. I accepted that the Wife had to step up to support the household in this aspect and was clearly its financial bedrock, especially in the latter half of the marriage. The Wife’s financial burden was further magnified when she contributed S$73,106 towards the repayment of the Husband’s business debts, and also helmed the fort by paying for most, if not all, of the expenses incurred by the family during the debt-ridden years of the marriage.

71     As the Wife was both the primary caregiver and the financial provider under extremely extenuating circumstances, the ratio of indirect contributions should be significantly uplifted from the usual case where the Wife is the primary caregiver but is an equal or lesser financial contributor to the marriage. I therefore accepted the Wife’s premise that the ratio of indirect contributions should be at least 80:20 in her favour.

72     I next considered an uplift to this ratio that would address the inequity occasioned by the manner in which the Husband handled the pawned jewellery. Given that the Husband had pawned off 400g of gold priced at S$70,000 per kilogram, this would have amounted to a sum of about S$28,000. As earlier mentioned, by redeeming all the jewellery and repatriating it to India, the Husband had deprived the Wife of the means to assess and add any jointly acquired jewelry to the matrimonial pool, as well as to assess the quantum of her indirect contributions by the pawning of her own jewelry to repay the Husband’s debts. I therefore adopted a broad brush approach and was minded to increase the Wife’s indirect contribution ratio to 90:10 on account of the indeterminate value of the gold jewellery. By way of a reality check, this uplift of 10% would, assuming both direct and indirect contributions were equally weighted, have yielded a 5% increase in the final _ANJ_ ratio awarded to the Wife. Based on the value of the matrimonial pool at S$404,537.73, a 5% increase would have amounted to $20,226.89. Given that the value of the pawned gold amounted to about $28,000, such an uplift would be represent a rough approximation of the value in terms of gold jewellery that the Wife had contributed to support the common endeavour of marriage.

73     Accordingly, I determined that a ratio of 90:10 in favour of the Wife was appropriate and necessary to reflect the indirect contributions she had made towards the family.

### Application of the ANJ approach: Step 3: Average ratio

74     For the reasons given above, the average ratio for the division of matrimonial assets would be as follows: -

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="37.12%"> <col width="28.5%"> <col width="34.38%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Husband</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Wife</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Direct contribution</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">64%</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">36%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Indirect contribution</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">10%</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">90%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Average ratio</b></p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>37%</b></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>63%</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

75     Having regard to the criteria set out in _ANJ_ at \[27\], I did not find that there was a need for any adjustment to the weightage of each ratio. This was not an exceptionally long marriage, nor were the assets substantially large or accrued by one party’s exceptional efforts. I therefore accorded equal weightage to both the direct contribution and the indirect contribution, and arrived at a provisional ratio of 63:37 in favour of the Wife.

76     Thereafter, I gave the Wife an uplift of 7% to her final ratio to take into account the rent-free occupation that the Husband had enjoyed since May 2016, for a period of nearly four years. As the market rate for rental of bedrooms in a similar property would be about S$1,500 to S$1,600 per month, this would amount to a total of about S$75,000. Given that the Wife had an equal right to reside in the property, a half-share of this imputed rental would have yielded her about S$37,500. By way of comparison, an uplift of 7% would have amounted to about S$28,317.64, based on the total value of the matrimonial pool (S$404,537.73). In my view, this uplift would sufficiently rectify the imbalance caused by the husband’s sole enjoyment of rent-free occupation. It should be highlighted that the Wife, having lived in rented accommodation for which she incurred rental of S$1,500.00 per month from July 2016 to March 2019, and S$1,750.00 every month from April 2019 to the date of the hearing, would have already spent some S$74,250.00 in rental expenses for which she would have been out of pocket. The increase in her share of the matrimonial assets occasioned by this uplift is therefore only a modest approximation of the benefit that had accrued to the Husband and the loss that she had suffered due to his sole occupation of the matrimonial home since 2016.

77     As a practical consideration, I also noted that a final ratio of 70:30 in favour of the Wife would also provide the Wife sufficient value in the division to take over her Husband’s share in the matrimonial flat, which would be of benefit to the young child by providing a stable roof over his head.

78     For the sake of completeness, I note that the Wife had requested for an adverse inference to be drawn due to (i) the Husband’s non-disclosure of his true income, on the basis that his income could not be $3,800.00 when his stated expenses were $5,726.00[^53], and (ii) lack of disclosure in interrogatories and discovery in relation to his past work and employment, his past and present business accounts, and the latest documents in support of his expenses, including further bank statements and the latest credit card/loan statements. Given the uplifts I had granted above, I did not find it necessary to draw such an adverse inference as requested.

79     On the basis of the court’s directions for division of 70% of the pool of matrimonial assets in favour of the Wife, parties were requested to draft a final order that would allow the Wife to retain the matrimonial property, with the appropriate transfer from the Husband’s CPF Special Account to the Wife’s CPF Special Account. I adopted the parties’ proposed draft and issued orders in relation to the division of matrimonial assets as follows:

>      **Division of matrimonial property**

> (a)    The Plaintiff's interest in the matrimonial flat located at XXX (the "matrimonial flat") is to be transferred to the Defendant, with no cash consideration to the Plaintiff or CPF refunds. The transfer shall take place within three (3) months from the date of the Certificate of Final Judgment. The costs of the transfer shall be borne by the Defendant solely. The Plaintiff shall continue to pay the arrears and monthly mortgage payment to UOB, as well as service and conservancy charges, until completion of the transfer.

> (b)    This order is made under section 112 of the Women's Charter (Cap. 353) and is subject to the Central Provident Fund Act (Cap. 36) (“CPF Act") and the subsidiary legislation made thereunder. The Central Provident Fund Board ("CPF Board") shall give effect to the terms of this order in accordance with the provisions of the CPF Act and the subsidiary legislation made thereunder.

>      **CPF monies**

> (c)    The Defendant (hereafter called the “Spouse") shall be entitled to $37,138.26 of the Plaintiff's (hereafter called the “Member") CPF monies pursuant to section 112 of the Women's Charter (Cap 353).

> (d)    The CPF Board shall transfer, from the monies standing to the credit of the Member as at the date of the transfer of the flat in the following CPF account of the Member, the amount specified as follows to the Spouse's CPF account. Member's CPF account to transfer from Amount to transfer Special Account $37,138.26

> (e)    All obligations to effect the transfer shall be on the Member and not on the Board.

> (f)    The Board shall only transfer the amount specified in this Order after the Board has been notified of the transfer of the flat.

> (g)    The parties, including the CPF Board, shall be at liberty to apply for further directions or orders generally.

>      **Other assets**

> (h)    Each party to retain their India properties and all other assets under their names.

## Maintenance for the Wife

80     Although the Husband did not appeal against the maintenance orders, I will, for the sake of completeness, provide brief grounds for my decision on maintenance.

81     The Wife took the position that she was not seeking maintenance for herself in her affidavits.[^54] However, in her submissions, she sought maintenance of S$500 per month for a period of three months when she was unemployed from June 2019 to September 2019.[^55] This was on the basis that she had to continue to pay for the child’s expenses when parties left the matrimonial home, without any contribution from the Husband. This included the child’s school fees, medical bills tuition fees and apportionment of rent.[^56]

82     The Husband’s position was that no maintenance should be due to the Wife as she was gainfully employed.

83     I noted that even though the Wife was unemployed for a short stint, she had since secured gainful employment and earned a monthly net salary of S$5,491.[^57] As the Wife was clearly self-sufficient, and considering the substantial uplift that had been made both to the Wife’s ratio of indirect contributions as well as the final ratio for division, any economic prejudice suffered by her when she was unemployed would have been evened out. Accordingly, I made no orders for maintenance for the Wife.

## Maintenance for the Child

84     The Husband had been paying interim maintenance of S$450 per month since December 2019 and proposed to continue paying this amount towards the child’s maintenance.[^58]

85     The Wife sought an order for the Husband to pay S$1,000 per month as maintenance for the child.[^59] She referred to the child’s list of expenses that was submitted in her application for interim maintenance in October 2019, as follows: -

86     The Wife further submitted that after deducting the child’s apportionment for rent, the monthly expenses would be in the range of S$1,200 to S$1,300 per month.

87     The Husband disputed the need for the child to attend after-school student care as the Wife had a domestic helper. However, the Wife denied that she had a helper and said that her mother would fly from India to assist her for a couple of months at a time. During the times when she did not have her mother’s assistance, the child would need to attend student care. The Wife also referred to some of the receipts that she had furnished, evidencing the amount that she had actually spent for student care.[^60] I accepted that the child would need to attend student care when the Wife would be at work and did not have the assistance of her mother. Accordingly, I accepted the child’s reasonable monthly expenses to be S$1,300.

88     I next turned to consider the relative incomes of the parties. The Wife submitted that her average monthly net salary was S$5,491.[^61] This was not disputed by the Husband. The Husband submitted that he earned a monthly net salary of S$3,800.[^62] He did not have any documents to support his position as he had just started his sole-proprietorship and his IRAS Notice of Assessment would not reflect this. The Wife however disagreed and referred me to the transactions labelled as “CAM” (which stood for cash deposit machine) in the Husband’s bank statements from February 2019 to July 2019.[^63] Based on the Husband’s response in the Wife’s requests for interrogatories, these transactions were the cash deposits made by the Husband from the payment he received from his business entity, XXX Enterprises.[^64] According to bank statements from February 2019 to July 2019, the Husband deposited an average amount of S$4,693 per month from the cash received from his business.

89     I accepted the Wife’s position that the Husband’s salary was actually S$4,693 per month. As the total income of both parents would be S$10,184, an appropriate ratio for apportionment of child maintenance would be 46% from the Husband and 54% from the Wife. On this basis, I ordered the Husband to contribute 46% of the child’s monthly expenses of S$1,300, which would amount to about S$600 per month.

90     The Wife sought an order for the maintenance for the child to be backdated to 1 June 2016, when she left the matrimonial home. The Husband disagreed and argued that he was struggling financially and would not be in the position to pay the backdated maintenance. While the court has a wide discretion to order backdated maintenance (per _AMW v AMZ_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGHC 83</span> at \[13\], referred to in _VDZ v VEA_ \[2020\] SGHCF at \[70\]), I considered that the Husband was financially strapped, given his inability to pay for the mortgage loan at present. It would, to my mind, be unfairly prejudicial to backdate the commencement of maintenance to 1 June 2016. As such, I ordered for maintenance for the child to commence from the date of this judgment.

## Costs

91     Counsel for the Husband submitted that as the divorce had proceeded on an uncontested basis and no cost orders were made at the Interim Judgment, each party should bear their respective costs. In the event that the court was minded to enter an order for costs against the Husband, it was submitted that costs should be fixed at no more than S$1,500.

92     Counsel for the Wife submitted that the Wife had taken out an application for interim maintenance where parties had to file two rounds of affidavits and attend two hearings before the matter was fixed for final determination with the ancillary matters. Counsel also argued that the Wife had succeeded in the ancillary matters and given the extensive amount of work involved, submitted for costs to be paid by the Husband, fixed at S$4,000 all-in.

93     As neither party prevailed in the entirety of their arguments before me, and in the interest of minimising the already acrimonious circumstances of this case, I was not minded to award costs in favour of either party. Accordingly, no order is made as to costs.
