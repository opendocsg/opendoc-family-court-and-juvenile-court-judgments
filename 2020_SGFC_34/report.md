Family Law – Family Violence - Personal Protection Order

30 March 2020

### District Judge Lo Wai Ping:

## Introduction

1       This was an application for the grant of a personal protection order (“PPO”) against the Respondent arising from the bodily hurt inflicted by him against his younger sister (“C”) at their family home on 26 May 2019 at about 7 pm in the evening (“the Incident”). At the time of the Incident, C was 19 years old and studying at a local polytechnic. The Respondent was 29 years old.

2       C’s PPO application against the Respondent was filed on 30 May 2019 on her behalf by C’s maternal aunt (“Aunt”) as C was a minor. C had moved out from her family home on the night of 27 May 2019 and had stayed with her Aunt since then.

3       The Respondent resisted the PPO application. Whilst he did not deny that he had hurt C on the night of 26 May 2019 at their family home and that it constituted family violence, he submitted that there was no necessity for a PPO to be granted for C’s protection.[^1]

4       At the end of the hearing, on 24 October 2019, I granted a PPO for C’s protection. The PPO was for a period of 4 years commencing on 24 October 2019. I also ordered C and the Respondent to attend counselling at an agency appointed by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (“MSF”). The Respondent has appealed against my orders.

## Background

5       At the hearing before me, apart from C and the Respondent, their mother (“Mother”) and Aunt also testified. The Aunt was C’s witness, whilst the Mother testified for the Respondent. The parties and their witnesses each filed an affidavit of their evidence in chief. Both parties were represented by counsel.

#### Parties’ evidence on the Incident on 26 May 2019

6       In essence, the Respondent’s evidence was that whilst he had hurt C during the Incident, it was but one slap and based on his account, it was because of her “persistent rebellious attitude and behaviour” that he had hit C in anger at the time on her face. The Mother, who was present during the Incident, gave evidence corroborating the Respondent’s evidence on this.

7       C’s evidence of what occurred during the Incident was different. She had in her affidavit and at the hearing maintained that the Respondent had not just given her a slap but had hit her at least 4 times on her face. Further, this was also not the first time the Respondent had hit her. She filed a police report on 28 May 2019 stating this, and she had also in that police report stated that she had left home to stay with her Aunt on the night of 27 May 2019 as she did not feel safe at home with the Respondent.

8       I set out the undisputed facts of the Incident below.

> (a)     It took place at the parties’ family home, a HDB flat (the “Flat”), where C was living together with her Mother, her elder sister and her 4-year old son and the Respondent. The father of C and the Respondent had passed away in 2017.

> (b)     At the time of the Incident on 26 May 2019, the Respondent, the Mother, C and C’s elder sister and her son were all in the Flat.

> (c)     C was in her bedroom doing her schoolwork when she heard her elder sister reprimanding her 4-year son on some work she was tutoring him on. C’s elder sister, her son and the Respondent were then in the living room.

> (d)     C came out of her bedroom and attempted to help her nephew with his work. Words were then exchanged between C and her elder sister (who was unhappy with C’s interference whilst she was disciplining her son). C admitted that her elder sister had told her not to interfere whilst she was reprimanding her son and that C had replied in a rude manner saying something like “your life itself is not good and you want to reprimand him?” and after this exchange of words, C went back into her bedroom.

> (e)     When C was already back in her bedroom and seated at her study table, the Respondent came into the bedroom. The Respondent admitted that he spoke to C loudly as he was very angry at her rude remarks to her elder sister but she had ignored him initially.[^2] But, subsequently, she had responded and there was an exchange of words between them. He admitted that their Mother had come to the bedroom because of the shouting she had heard and eventually, his exchange of words with C ended with him hitting C.[^3] In his affidavit, the Respondent alleged that his Mother had told C to stop talking and behaving in an unruly manner and C had replied to the Mother rudely and told the Mother to discipline the Respondent and her elder sister instead, before talking to her. And, at that time, considering her ‘persistent rebellious attitude and behaviour’, the Respondent got so angry, he slapped C and shouted at her to stop.

> The Respondent therefore admitted to hitting C and causing bodily hurt to C, both in his affidavit evidence in chief and also during the trial. He said in his affidavit that he felt extremely sad for raising his hands at C and that he had acted out of turn. But, he claimed he had only given C one slap to her face at the time.

> Based on C’s evidence, the Respondent had hit her at least 4 times on the face and this was not the first time he had hit her. In her affidavit and at the hearing, C maintained how it was the Respondent who was the aggressor right from the start. First, the Respondent had barged into her bedroom and shouted at her for interfering with her elder sister’s affairs, and when C ignored him and continued doing her schoolwork at her desk, he became more agitated. The Respondent continued shouting at C before approaching her threateningly whilst she was still seated at her study table. When C told the Respondent that she did not want to get into an argument with him and that the matter had nothing to do with him, he then started to use derogatory words and insulting remarks against her. C explained that it was because of the commotion the Respondent was creating that their Mother came into her bedroom and tried to persuade the Respondent to stop shouting at C but to no avail. And when C told the Respondent that she did not wish to argue with him and that if he wished to talk, they should speak calmly, the Respondent became incensed and shouted at her “not to talk back” and then, the physical violence started with the Respondent slapping C on both her cheeks (2 or 3 times in quick succession), punching her left shoulder which caused the chair she was sitting on to roll away from the table and bang against the wall, and then, punching her twice on the left side of her head, near her outer eye and temple.

> Hence, although the parties’ accounts differed over how the assault happened and the number of times the Respondent had hit C in her bedroom, there was no dispute that the Respondent had come into C’s bedroom to confront her (over an earlier exchange C had with her elder sister), that the Respondent had been very angry with C at the time and even more so when she refused to respond to him and that thereafter, when she finally responded to him and they had an exchange of words, the Respondent had hit her on her face near her left eye/temple region (whilst she was seated in her chair) and that there was bleeding from the injuries she suffered as a result of his actions.

> (f)     It was not disputed that thereafter, the Respondent left the Flat and C’s elder sister quickly brought C for medical treatment, first at a clinic before being referred by the doctor at the clinic to seek treatment at a hospital. C’s elder sister brought C to the emergency department of a private hospital (“Hospital”). C had suffered a laceration near her eye/temple area which required stitching. C had to be placed under sedation for this surgical procedure and consents were obtained by the Hospital from the Aunt and subsequently also from the Mother for the whole procedure. C was admitted into the Hospital and stayed overnight for her condition to be monitored. She was discharged on 27 May 2019 in the afternoon and fetched back to the Flat by her elder sister and Mother. On the night of 27 May 2019, she left the Flat to stay with her Aunt. C was still staying with her Aunt at the time of the hearing.

9       It was not disputed that shortly after the occurrence of the Incident, the Aunt received a call from her sister, the Mother, who told her that the Respondent had hit C. The Mother was distraught and crying at the time and had asked the Aunt to come over immediately to her Flat. The Aunt (who was staying a few blocks away) rushed over to the Flat and at the Flat, the Mother was crying. The Mother told the Aunt that the Respondent had hit and injured C and C’s elder sister had brought C to the clinic below to seek treatment. The Aunt was also shown C’s blood-stained shirt. According to the Aunt, the Mother also told her that night that the Mother had tried to stop the Respondent’s from hitting C, but was in fact pushed by the Respondent.[^4]

10     Subsequently, the Aunt had gone to the Hospital about 10pm that night. She was informed by the doctor attending to C about the surgical procedure that was required to stitch up C’s open wound (laceration) near the left eye. The Aunt paid the deposit required by the Hospital and also signed the authorisation form for C’s medical treatment. The surgical procedure was only completed about midnight.

11     It was also not disputed that following C’s discharge on 27 May 2019 afternoon, C had gone home to the Flat to rest but there had been further occurrences relating to the Incident on 27 May 2019 and these had in the end led to C leaving the Flat that night to stay with her Aunt.

#### Events on 27 May 2019

12     Based on C’s account, the events of 27 May 2019 were as follows:

> (a)     She was aware that the Aunt and Mother were going to have a family discussion on 27 May 2019 with the Respondent relating to Incident. Her Aunt had called her whilst she was still in Hospital on 27 May 2019 and told her this. Her Mother had also separately told her this on 27 May 2019. Her Mother and elder sister had fetched her home in the afternoon after her discharge from the Hospital. When she reached home, she had gone straight to her room to rest. She did not know if the Respondent was at home at the time.

> (b)     On the night of 27 May 2019, 2 of friends visited her. Her Aunt had arrived later at the Flat. When C was still in her room with her friends, she heard the Respondent coming out of his room and shouting loudly. When C first heard him shouting, she was frightened that matters would escalate. At that time, her Aunt also entered her room and quickly told her friends to leave the Flat and they did so. Thereafter, her Aunt returned to the hall, whilst C remained in her bedroom. C then heard the Respondent being verbally abusive to her Aunt first and then both the Respondent and her Aunt started arguing and they were both using profanities on each other.

> (c)     As C was afraid of her brother’s behaviour and that he would hurt her again, she did not dare to leave her bedroom. It was her Mother who called her out of her room. When she came out into the hall, her Aunt and the Respondent were still engaged in a heated exchange. She recalled her Aunt asking the Respondent how the Incident happened and the Respondent repeatedly refusing to answer and becoming increasingly aggressive towards the Aunt. Then when her Mother went between her Aunt and the Respondent, she saw the Respondent aggressively pushing her Mother away. The Aunt and the Respondent then continued arguing with the Respondent also shouting at the Aunt to leave the Flat. When the Aunt left the Flat, she had asked her Aunt if she could follow her, but her Aunt had refused her request.

> (d)     After the Aunt left, there was an attempt to sit down and have a family discussion with the Respondent but the Respondent was unapologetic and he started shouting at her aggressively and also used words on her. As C feared for her safety, she then left the Flat shortly thereafter for her Aunt’s place and since then, she has stayed at her Aunt’s flat and not returned home.

13     The Aunt testified as to how she had on the morning of 27 May 2019 called the Mother to ask her what she would be doing to ensure C’s safety moving forward and the Mother had told her that she would be asking C to make a police report on the Incident and that she would also be asking the Respondent to leave the Flat. The Aunt and the Mother had then planned to talk to the Respondent about the Incident that night. The Aunt had arrived at about 9pm at the Flat for the family discussion. However, right from the start that night, the Respondent was aggressive and shouting at them in the Flat (“_you all want to talk right, ok fine let’s talk”_). As the Aunt was fearful of the Respondent’s temper, she then asked C’s friends to leave first. Thereafter, she went to sit at the dining table in the hall but the Respondent was very agitated and verbally abusive to her. He was adamant that the Aunt should leave the family discussion but the Aunt refused to do so. They then became engaged in a heated exchange of words, with both using vulgarities on the other. The Respondent then started moving towards the Aunt in a threatening manner and when the Mother tried to stop him, the Respondent had aggressively pushed his Mother. The Respondent even held a clenched fist to the Aunt’s face and threatened to hit her and he shouted at her to leave the Flat. Given his behaviour, the Aunt felt it was futile to remain and she also did not want the situation to get worse, and so, she left the Flat. She refused to let C go with her at that point even though C had called out to her to wait for her. However, later that night, C called the Aunt to say that she would be going to the Aunt’s house as she felt unsafe at home. At about 10.30pm, C arrived at the Aunt’s flat. According to the Aunt, it was very apparent that C was shaken as she was crying badly when she arrived.

#### Events on 28 and 29 May 2019

14     C also testified that on the following day (28 May 2019) in the afternoon, her Mother had come to the Aunt’s place to talk to C. On this occasion, the Mother had called the Respondent on the telephone to apologise to C, but the Respondent had refused to do so. On the night of 28 May 2019, C then filed a police report against the Respondent. Her Mother had earlier told her to file a police report.

15     However, on 29 May 2019, the Mother called C to inform her that the Respondent now wanted to apologise to her. Thereafter, the Respondent and the Mother had met C at a HDB void deck near the Flat. It should be noted that C was accompanied by a male friend during this meeting and at the meeting, the Respondent had apologised to C.

#### Previous episode in July 2018 where Respondent had hit C

16     I turn now to C’s evidence that the Respondent had assaulted her previously on 23 July 2018. On that occasion, the Respondent had reprimanded her for coming back late and for drinking. When she responded to this, they had an exchange of words and then the Respondent had pulled her hair, pushed her against the wall before slapping her multiple times. C stated that she was in fear and traumatised by his actions but she did not seek medical attention as she was afraid then of escalating the matter. But, she did confide in her friend, **A**, about it at the time, and as proof, C produced her WhatsApp chatlog with A in July 2018 on this matter.

17     It should be noted that under cross-examination, the Respondent admitted that he had laid hands on C before in July 2018.[^5] This was also confirmed by the Mother when she was cross-examined about it.[^6]

## Decision

18     Section 65(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353) (“Section 65(1)”) states as follows:

> “The court may, upon satisfaction on a balance of probabilities that family violence has been committed or is likely to be committed against a family member and that it is necessary for the protection of the family member, make a protection order restraining the person against whom the order is made from using family violence against the family member.”

19     Based on the undisputed facts set out above about the Incident, the Respondent had caused hurt to C and I was also satisfied, having considered all the evidence before me, that C had proven, on a balance of probabilities, the first limb of Section 65(1) that the Respondent’s actions that night did constitute an act of family violence committed by the Respondent against C.

20     I noted that C had acknowledged that she was rude to her elder sister in their exchange of words just before the Incident. However, their exchange had ended and C had returned to her bedroom and was at her study table when the Respondent barged into the room and confronted her about the matter. The Respondent admitted that he was furious at C when he entered her room and that he became even more upset when she did not respond to him. Having heard the parties and their witnesses, I accepted C’s evidence as to what happened during the Incident, that the Respondent was the aggressor and was shouting at her in her bedroom, that she had not wanted to engage him initially; and that when she finally responded to his words and they had an exchange of words, he then hit her on the face more than once resulting in the injuries she sustained that night.

21     I did not accept the evidence of the Respondent and the Mother that the Respondent had simply given C one slap on her face. I also did not accept the Mother’s evidence that the Respondent was only “a bit angry” at the time when he hit C.

22     It was clear to me that the Respondent was trying to excuse his aggression and physical violence and hurt caused to C that night by alluding to C’s rude and rebellious behaviour. As for the Mother, it was clear to me that she was trying to help the Respondent by supporting his evidence that he had only slapped C once during the Incident.

23     I accepted the Aunt’s evidence that the Mother was distraught and crying when she called her that night for help; and that at the Flat, the Mother had told the Aunt that she had tried to stop the Respondent from hitting C, but to no avail and that she was herself pushed by the Respondent when she tried to stop him.

24     The fact that there was a family discussion arranged with the Respondent the very night after C returned home from the Hospital was also consistent with the fact that what had occurred during the Incident was more serious than what the Respondent and the Mother were now trying to paint before the Court. Indeed, if what they were alleging was true – that it was a mere slap and that what the Respondent had done was in order ‘as an older brother’ and in the nature of ‘discipline’, then it begs the question why the Mother admitted subsequently that she had given C (upon her discharge from the Hospital and before she returned to the Flat on 27 May 2019) her “full assurance” that what the Respondent had done to C would not happen again in future.[^7] That the Mother had to give this assurance to C was evidence that the Mother recognised that what the Respondent had done was wrong and that C was fearful that the Respondent’s acts of physical violence against her could recur.

25     It should be noted that whilst the Mother had attempted to support the Respondent’s actions, she herself admitted under cross-examination that she was the main disciplinarian in the family and that it was not right to lay hands on children once they reached teenage years. She also admitted that Respondent had a hot-temper and that she had talked to the Respondent after the Incident, and he had agreed that what he did was wrong.

26     As for C, I found that she had given her evidence in an honest and straightforward manner. She did not deny that the Respondent had started by reprimanding her for her rudeness on 26 May 2019 and she also did not deny that on the occasion of 23 July 2018 when the Respondent had hit her, it was also after an argument between them that was related to her behaviour. However, these shortcomings on her part did not in her view justify the Respondent’s actions of hitting her. She also explained that whilst the Respondent had apologised to her on 29 May 2019, it did not change the fact that this was the second time he had hit her. She was frightened of him as he had a trigger temper and she was of the view that notwithstanding her Mother’s promises to deal with the Respondent, her Mother had not been able to do so on the night of 27 May 2019 and there was fear that he would hit her again. For that reason, she had left the Flat that night to stay with her Aunt and filed the PPO application on 30 May 2019.

27     Given the above and the evidence adduced by C as to what the Respondent had done on 23 July 2018 and now on 26 May 2019, and having regard also to the Respondent’s aggressive and threatening behaviour to the Aunt on the night of 27 May 2019 and the way he had treated C after the Aunt left, I did not accept the Respondent’s evidence that C was not in fear of him and that a PPO was not necessary for C’s protection. It should also be noted that when C went to meet the Respondent on 29 May 2019 (for his apology), she did not go alone but was accompanied by a friend. And, whilst the Respondent alleged that C was acting under the influence of the Aunt, it should be noted that it was the Mother herself who had first called the Aunt for help shortly after the Incident and it was the Mother who told C that C should lodge a police report on the Incident against the Respondent.

28     The Respondent had also submitted that as C had no intention of returning to the Flat, there was no necessity for a PPO to be granted against him. I disagreed. The mere fact that C was now staying with the Aunt should not be the reason why a PPO should not be issued against the Respondent. C was staying with the Aunt precisely due to her fear of the Respondent as experienced during the Incident and narrated above. It should be noted that the Respondent was the only male in the Flat and the Incident clearly showed that the Mother could not control the Respondent. Even if C did not intend to return to the Flat to stay with the family, the fact remained that that was where her Mother and elder sister were residing and her family home and there would still be occasions when C would want to meet up with her Mother and elder sister at the Flat. C should not be required to keep away from seeing her Mother and her elder sister at the Flat due to her fear of the Respondent. A PPO issued against the Respondent would have a restraining effect on the Respondent.

29     Given all the above, I was therefore satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the second limb of Section 65(1) was proven – that it was necessary for C’s protection that a PPO be issued against the Respondent. I limited, however, the duration of the PPO to 4 years taking into account the circumstances under which the acts of violence were committed on both occasions and ordered both C and the Respondent to attend counselling at an agency appointed by MSF. In doing so, I was mindful that the Respondent and C should not let the Incident mar their relationship permanently and they should make efforts to repair their relationship in the interest of their love and care for their Mother. In my view, with the help of professional counselling and the passage of time and the growing maturity of both parties, a PPO should not be necessary beyond the 4 -year term, by which time, C would also be older - about 23 years old.

30     Having granted C’s PPO application, on the issue of costs, I ordered the Respondent to pay fixed costs of $3,000 (all in, inclusive of disbursements) after hearing submissions and taking into account the work done and time spent on the hearing.
