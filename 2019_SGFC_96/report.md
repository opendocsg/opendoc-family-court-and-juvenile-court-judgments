S71 Women’s Charter – enforcement of maintenance arrears – lack of specificity in divorce order

6 September 2019

### District Judge Geraldine Kang:

## Brief Background

1       Parties were married in China in 1995, and there was one son to the marriage who was born to them in 1999. For ease of reference, the Appellant shall be referred to as the Mother and the Respondent shall be referred to as the Father in this grounds of decision.

2       Their marriage broke down sometime in 2014; however, parties were able to part ways on amicable terms and resolved all ancillary issues via a **_consent order_**.

3       The pertinent terms of the divorce order dated 17 March 2014, in respect of the Mother and Son’s maintenance is as follows:

> _Clause 3(d) :_      _The \[Father\] shall pay the \[Mother\] maintenance of $500 per month with effect from the filing of the Writ herein and which maintenance shall be paid to the \[Mother\] on the 1st day of every calendar month._

> _Clause 3(e) :_      _The \[Father\] shall provide a monthly maintenance of $1000 for the child with effect from the filing of the Writ and such maintenance shall be credited paid (sic) to the \[Mother\] on the first day of each calendar month._

4       It bears noting that the above orders were made without reference to the mode of payment ie. Whether it was to be made in cash or via bank transfer, and if so, which bank account were the monies to be deposited into.

5       This was the first enforcement application commenced by the Mother under Section 71 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353) since their divorce in 2014. When queried as to why she did not take any enforcement action prior to the present application, her response was that she was ignorant of her rights to do so and she was also not aware of the process of enforcement.

6       Having heard the evidence of all parties as well as taking into account the background surrounding the present case, I dismissed the Mother’s present application on the basis that the Father had shown cause for any non-payment of maintenance sums owing to the Mother and/or Son as at the conclusion of the hearing before me. The Mother, being dissatisfied with my decision has appealed against the entirety of my decision. I shall now set forth my reasons.

## (1)   The Mother’s Case

7       Prior to the commencement of the hearing before myself, the Court had to establish the precise breakdown of the arrears that the Mother was alleging for herself and the son. It bears noting that from the onset, the Mother conceded that she did not keep records of the _cash payments_ that the Father made, but stated that it was no more than $400 on each occasion; neither was she able to confirm the frequency or regularity of such cash payments be it to herself or the son directly.

8       Despite the lack of specificity of her claim, the Mother was adamant about enforcing the arrears. In the circumstances, the Court had to explain to the Mother that unless she was able to put forth absolute sums that were allegedly owing to her and/or her son, it would not have been prudent nor efficient to commence the trial. Under these circumstances, the Mother then calculated the outstanding arrears for the period May 2016 to April 2019 (being within the 3 years statutory limit of which she was entitled to claim for alleged arrears) as follows:

> (a)     $17,100 – maintenance arrears owing to herself (“**Mother’s arrears**”)

> (b)     $30,800 - maintenance arrears owing to the son. (“**Son’s arrears**”)

> The sum total of $49,000 was being claimed by the Mother against the Father (“**Total Arrears**”)

9       The Mother’s evidence as to the arrangement between the parties was that, they would sometimes meet up for meals and that the Father would give her varying cash sums. However, he was often short of cash and he would usually contribute towards the son’s maintenance first instead of hers. And when the Father requested for some flexibility in the payments, she did not object to it[^1].

10     The Mother also asserted that the Son’s Arrears was premised on what the Son had informed her was outstanding[^2]. She testified that she would ask the Son if the Father had given him any money and the Son will inform her accordingly.

## (2)   The Father’s Defence

11     Whilst the Father denied the Total Arrears claimed by the Mother, he accepted that he had not paid in full compliance with the maintenance sums ordered in the divorce order. But as he did not keep records of the cash payments he made to his sum, he was not able to agree to the sums she was presently pursuing as arrears[^3].

12     In any case, he also urged the court to consider his own plight due to his medical ailments (diabetes and heart related issues) and age (67 years old). It was his position that he did not have the financial resources nor ability to repay this amount. He further argued that at the time of the divorce, he had already given her more than what was expected of him. At present, he was next to penniless now with barely any savings for himself and was struggling to make ends meet as a Grab driver[^4]. However, he was not looking to shriek his responsibility towards their son, but would continue to support their son in whatever way he could.

## (3)   The Son’s Evidence

13     This was highly relevant to the Mother’s case especially since the bulk of her claim was for the Son’s arrears and it was her evidence that the Son’s Arrears were tabulated on the basis of what the Son had directly informed her.

14     Unfortunately, the Son was unable to corroborate her case and candidly informed the Court that it was only on occasions that he would update or inform the Mother about the monies he would receive directly from the Father. He was unable to recall with any precision as to when he would inform his mother about receiving monies from the father, and if so, how much[^5]. The Father and Son would make arrangements between themselves to meet and have a meal, and during their interactions, if there the issue of monies arose, the Father would make whatever contribution he could via bank transfer to the son directly.

15     The Son left an independent and mature impression on the Court, he appeared to be self-sufficient and independent. It was his evidence that even if he was short of money, he had not told the Mother that the Father was not giving him an allowance[^6].

## (4)   The Law

16     The law relating to enforcement proceedings relating to maintenance orders is stipulated in Section 71 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353):

> _Enforcement of maintenance order_

> _71\. (1_)     _If any person fails to make one or more payments required to be made under a maintenance order, the court which made the order may do all or any of the following:_

>> (_a_)     _for every breach of the order by warrant direct the amount due to be levied in the manner by law provided for levying fines imposed by a Magistrate’s Court;_

>> (_b_)     _sentence him to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one month for each month’s allowance remaining unpaid;_

>> (_c_)     _a garnishee order in accordance with the Family Justice Rules made under this Act;_

>> (_d_)     _order the person to furnish security against any future default in maintenance payments by means of a bankerʼs guarantee which —_

>>> (_i_)     _shall be valid for such period (not exceeding 3 years) as the court may determine, starting from the date the order for security is made; and_

>>> (_ii_)    _shall be for an amount not exceeding 3 months of maintenance payable under the maintenance order;_

>> (_e_)     _if the court considers it in the interests of the parties in the maintenance proceedings or their children to do so, order the person to undergo financial counselling or such other similar or related programme as the court may direct;_

>> (_f_)     _make a community service order requiring the person to perform any unpaid community service for up to 40 hours under the supervision of a community service officer._

## (5)   The Court’s Findings & Decision

17     The Mother’s case as to how she tabulated the Total Arrears was at best a “guess-timate”. The reality was that neither party had followed the letter of the law and did not adhere to the terms of the Divorce Order for the payment of maintenance. As the pertinent terms of the Divorce Order did not specify how the maintenance was to be paid, the arrangements between parties was entirely fluid without any fixed expectations or understanding as to how the maintenance was to be paid. It was not disputed that neither party kept proper records of any payments made.

18     The Court recognised that there was a factual situation of outstanding arrears, as the Father himself conceded that he had not made full payment of the maintenance sums in the Divorce Order; however the Mother could not prove nor establish with credibility that she was entitled to pursue the Total Arrears. The Son was not able to substantiate her version of events, and I also found it less than credible that she would have waited this long to enforce the outstanding arrears.

19     There was no dispute that the Father gave the Son monies on an ad-hoc basis and there was no regular or fixed sum given. In this regard, the Mother’s claim for the sum of $30,800 as maintenance owing to the Son could not be verified and in fact by the Son’s very own testimony, undermined the Mother’s claim.

20     As the Court was able to accept the factual arrears (but not the quantum), the next point was to consider whether the Father had shown cause for the non-payment of such factual arrears. On the facts, I found that he did indeed show cause for the non-payment. There was an implicit (and even explicit) understanding between the Mother and Father that the terms of the Divorce Order need not have to complied with; or at least the Mother was prepared to grant the Father some leeway and flexibility with his maintenance obligations.

21     Accordingly, I dismissed the Mother’s entire application and find that there were no outstanding arrears as at July 2019 (which was the conclusion of the hearing before me). The Court did take pains to emphasize to the Father that notwithstanding the dismissal of this enforcement application, his obligation under the Divorce Order was an existing one, unless steps were taken to vary it.
