Family Law – Maintenance – s69, Women’s Charter

31 October 2019

### District Judge Cheryl Koh:

## A.    Introduction

1       MSS No. 1484 of 2019 is the application of the complainant mother (the “**Complainant**”) for maintenance for one (1) child (the “**Child**”) against the respondent father (the “**Respondent**”), pursuant to section 69 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353).

2       The Complainant requested for the sum of $2,254.50 per month as maintenance of the Child. The Respondent initially offered the sum of $300.00 per month at a mention, but reduced his offer to the sum of $250.00 per month at the hearing. On 5 August 2019, I ordered the Respondent to pay the Complainant the sum of $750.00 per month as maintenance of the Child. I also ordered the Respondent to pay a one-off sum of $450.00 towards the Child’s tuition expenses.

3       The Respondent has appealed.

## B.    Background Facts

4       Parties were never married. The Child was born on XXX 2000 out of wedlock. He is currently aged 19 years old and studying in XXX Junior College.

5       The Complainant is 54 years old and works as a part time freelance beautician. The Respondent is 61 years old and is unemployed. Prior to unemployment, he worked as a Country Director and a Technical Director.

6       Parties have tendered the following documents:

> a.     the Complainant’s Affidavit; and

> b.     the Respondent’s documents marked as “**R1**” pages 1 to 79, “**R2**” pages 1 to 17, “**R3**” pages 1 to 2 and “**R4**”.

## C.    Grounds of Decision

#### The law

7       Parties do not dispute that a maintenance order ought to be made for the Child; the issue is as to the quantum of maintenance that should be ordered for him. The Complainant sought the monthly sum of $2,254.50, whilst the Respondent only offered the monthly sum of $250.00 to $300.00.

8       In this regard, section 69(4) of the Women’s Charter stipulates that the Court, when deciding on maintenance for a wife or child, shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the following matters:

> a.     the financial needs of the wife or child;

> b.     the income, earning capacity (if any), property and other financial resources of the wife or child;

> c.     any physical or mental disability of the wife or child;

> d.     the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage;

> e.     the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family;

> f.     the standard of living enjoyed by the wife or child before the husband or parent, as the case may be, neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the wife or child;

> g.     in the case of a child, the manner in which he was being, and in which the parties to the marriage expected him to be, educated or trained; and

> h.     the conduct of each of the parties to the marriage, if the conduct is such that it would in the opinion of the court be inequitable to disregard it.

9       Applying the above factors to this case, I will specifically consider the Complainant’s means, the Respondent’s means and the Child’s expenses in determining the appropriate reasonable maintenance for the Child.

#### The Complainant’s means

10     The Complainant is a freelance beautician. She declared that she earned an average income of $2,000.00 per month. She explained that she worked twice a week at a friend’s shop, and for the rest of the time, from home[^1]. She has no income documents, as she did not earn enough income to pay income tax[^2]. Her earnings were limited as she worked from home in Bukit Batok, and some of her old customers found her house too far away and declined to travel[^3]. She did not produce her list of expenses in the proceedings herein, but, as will be explained below, it is clear that the Complainant is of limited income capacity and financial resources as compared to the Respondent.

#### The Respondent’s means

11     Although the Respondent is currently unemployed, he is a man of means. Prior to unemployment, he worked as a Country Director in a private company with a monthly income of $13,000.00 per month[^4] and a Technical Director with a monthly salary of $10,000.00 per month[^5]. His income revenue statement dated 5 May 2017 showed that he had previously earned an annual gross income of $211,087.50 ($17,590.60 per month). The Respondent’s credit limit alone is $81,000.00.[^6]

12     The Respondent is also the owner of the following properties:

> a.     a condominium unit at Cuscaden Walk, with a last transacted price of $2.9 million.[^7] The Respondent resides in this property with his family;

> b.     a condominium unit in Spring Grove at Grange Road which is being rented out; and

> c.     a condominium unit in Canberra Drive which is also being rented out.

13     The Respondent earned rental income from the properties at Spring Grove and Canberrra Drive amounting to $27,324.00 (as reflected in his IRAS statement dated 26 March 2019[^8]), $41,806.50 (as reflected in his IRAS statement dated 24 August 2018[^9]) and $41,999.50 (as reflected in his IRAS statement dated 05 May 2017[^10]).

14     The Respondent argued that the rental income is insufficient to maintain the cost of maintaining these properties (including servicing the housing loans). However, it is clear that these properties are of net equity in that their values exceed the housing loans. For the property at Spring Grove, it is being rented out at $3,400.00 per month[^11] and has an outstanding housing loan of only $37,517.00[^12]. As to the property at Canberra Drive, it is being rented out at $4,800.00 per month[^13]. For the property at Cuscaden Walk, whilst the last transacted price of a similar unit is $2.9 million, it has a smaller outstanding housing loan of $1.6 million. The Respondent has taken additional term loans on these properties (on top of the housing loans), but he admitted that these are for his own expenses.

15     The Respondent claimed his expenses to be over $13,778.00[^14] but the sum comprises of $7,605.00 cash for his mortgage loans, which would be significantly covered by rental income of $8,200.00 per month. The Respondent is also married with two children, and his wife is assisting him in the household and children’s expenses.

#### The Child’s reasonable expenses

16     The Complainant claimed the Child’s expenses to be $2,254.20 per month and sought for the Respondent to bear the entire sum. I found the Child’s reasonable expenses to amount to around $1,135.00 per month and ordered the Respondent to pay monthly maintenance of $750.00:

17     Given the Complainant’s limited income capacity and financial resources _vis-à-vis_ the Respondent as discussed in \[10\] to \[15\] herein, and that the Complainant would have to bear the cost of the Child’s tuition, extra-curricular activities and miscellaneous expenses moving forward, I found it reasonable for the Respondent to pay the monthly maintenance of $750.00 per month for the Child. I also ordered the Respondent to contribute a sum of $450.00 towards the Child’s tuition, which would cease after the Child’s exams in October 2019. It is also noteworthy that the Child is already 19 years old, and the Respondent’s maintenance obligations under the order made herein would automatically expire in a mere couple of years.

18     The Respondent highlighted that he gave the Complainant various sums of monies for the Child over the years, including the sums of $10,000.00 and $6,000.00 in 2005, $18,000.00 in 2017 and $10,000.00 in 2018. This barely amounted to $190.00 per month over the Child’s 19 years. The Complainant explained she has expended part of these monies towards repayment of loans. In any event, the Respondent’s past provision of maintenance does not obliterate his future maintenance obligations towards the Child.

## D.    Conclusion

19     In these circumstances, I made the orders herein accordingly.
