Division of Matrimonial Property – Indirect Contributions – Custody, Care & Control and Access - Maintenance

8 August 2019

### District Judge Lim Keng Yeow:

### Introduction

1       The parties married on 31 December 2002 and, some 16 years later on 7 May 2018, obtained interim judgment of divorce. The ancillary matters came before me subsequently. After I made orders in relation to the division of matrimonial assets, to the care of the three children of the marriage, and as to the issue of maintenance, the Defendant Husband (“the Husband”) filed an appeal against the same. These Grounds address his appeal and explain the ancillary orders which I made.

### Matrimonial Asset and Direct Contributions

2       Applying the structured approach under _ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGCA 34</span>, I first considered what formed the pool of the matrimonial assets. Before me, the parties agreed that the only matrimonial asset to be considered and divided is the matrimonial home at “\[address redacted\]” and that it had a net value of $360,000. It was also agreed that respective direct contributions were 40:60 in favour of the Husband.

### Indirect Contributions

3       In light of the above, the appeal, as regards the division of assets at least, appeared to centre on the assessment of the parties’ indirect contributions.

4       In seeking to enlarge the extent of his own contributions, the Husband placed considerable reliance on the many financial and non-financial contributions of his mother, the paternal grandmother of the three children of the marriage. I saw no reason to doubt the extent of the grandmother’s contributions. The Plaintiff Wife (“the Wife”) worked throughout the marriage and I accepted that the grandmother did give considerable help. But whether I should count her contributions in the Husband’s favour, for apparently no reason other than that she was _his_ mother, is another matter.

5       In my judgment, that should not be so. The Husband did not put forward any legal authorities to persuade me that her efforts and expenditure on the children ought to be credited to him and counted as his. In assessing what contributions are made for purposes of division, what matters, fundamentally, ought to be the contributions _to_ the marriage _by_ the parties of the marriage. Unless there are facts which persuade the court otherwise, the contributions of others should have no bearing on the division, and it is really the respective contributions by the parties _inter se_ that count.

6       I leave open the possibility that the Husband’s contentions could be strengthened if the evidence indicated that the grandmother had no personal relationship with the family and the grandchildren, and made indirect contributions purely on account of her relationship with her son. The Husband’s case could also be possibly advanced by evidence that he had to repay her for whatever she contributed, and did actually do so. But there was no evidence of this. Nothing indicated that the grandmother made her contributions purely as the Husband’s mother or on behalf of her son, expecting some form of return or compensation from him.

7       I found no reason in principle and on the evidence as to why the grandmother’s contributions here should have any bearing on the division as between the parties. The only contributions that ought to count towards division here are personal contributions of the parties to the household and family. I concluded that I ought not to ascribe the grandmother’s contributions to the Husband.

8       As against the parties, the Husband, in submissions made on his behalf, accepted that the Wife had made greater indirect financial contributions than he did. Indeed, he would be hard put to deny this. The evidence indicated that the Wife was gainfully employed throughout the marriage, while there were gaps in the Husband’s employment and ability to maintain the family. The Wife paid for hefty infant-care and child-care expenses for their youngest child amounting to over $32,000[^1]. The Husband himself acknowledged that she was better educated than him, and would pay more than he did[^2].

9       On top of contributing more financially, I found that the Wife also contributed more in non-financial ways. The parties have three children, and they were aged 13, 12 and 3 at the time of the ancillaries. While the grandmother provided much help in the care of the children, as between the two parents, it was clear that the Wife had played a bigger parenting role than the Husband throughout the 16-year marriage. If, between them, anyone was looked upon as the children’s primary caregiver, it was the Wife and not the Husband.

10     The Husband himself conceded that he relied on her for decisions in relation to their schooling of the children, and that the Wife was the one who picked up the children from after-school care after she got back from work[^3]. I also noted the undisputed fact that the Husband had his personal mental health issues, resulting in his being hospitalised at the Institute of Mental Health for a while. It is hardly surprising that the issues would have affected his contributions, especially around that period of time.

11     On the whole, the evidence showed clearly that the Wife made greater indirect contributions than the Husband in both financial and non-financial spheres. While I have no doubt that the Husband did make some financial and non-financial contributions, I accepted that the family ultimately counted on the Wife to hold down her full-time job whilst functioning as the primary care-parent for the children. As between the parties, her overall contributions were significantly greater than the Husband’s. On a broad brush basis, I determined the respective indirect contributions to be 80:20 in favour of the Wife.

### Weightage and Proportion for Division

12     The Wife went on to contend that a much higher weightage should be accorded to indirect contributions in this case. I was not persuaded that this would be appropriate. Having already fully recognised her indirect contributions, attaching greater weight to those contributions could result in double-crediting the Wife for her contributions. I determined that equal weightage should be given to both sets of contributions.

13     The result of that was that the overall proportion for division of the matrimonial flat was 60:40 in favour of the Wife. Instead of a sale of the matrimonial flat, the Wife requested that it be transferred to her while she paid the Husband his share of the division. I saw no reason to deny her that, especially in light of the orders concerning the children, and ordered the same.

### Orders Relating to the Children

14     Despite whatever concerns raised by the Wife over the Husband’s parenting, I saw no reason to exclude him from custody and found that joint custody remained appropriate. As for care and control of the children, I noted that the evidence showed that the Wife, rather than the Husband, functioned as their primary caregiver and had played a bigger parenting role than the Husband over the years. I also noted that the youngest child was only 3 years old, and that there was no reason to consider split care and control of the children. I had little difficulty deciding that it would be in their best interests for the care and control of all 3 children to go to the Wife.

15     I go on to address the issues relating to the Husband’s access to be children. I decided that extended weekend access from 8.00am to 6.00pm every Sunday should take place in the presence of another trusted adult, and was also prepared to grant weeknight access at a public place which could be unsupervised.

16     The Husband accepted that an incident took place where he “lost control”, demonstrated “suicidal tendencies”, and had to receive a Police warning for his conduct[^4]. I also noted that there is a personal protection order against the Husband for the protection of the Wife and the children. In addition, I also had concerns over some trauma that may have been caused to their oldest daughter through the Husband’s words and actions. I decided that it would be prudent for extended weekend access to take place in the presence of another trusted adult (which would most probably be the maternal grandmother and at her home).

17     Provision for a parent’s access to be supervised should ordinarily not continue indefinitely. The need for this should normally reduce over time as the children grow older. I decided to allow for a review in 9 months, specifically on the issue of supervision (and not on other issues relating to access such as length or frequency of access). In this case, I also decided that the Husband should also have some unsupervised time with the children. Hence I provided that every alternate week, the Husband may have access to the children on one weeknight as agreed to by parties for 2 hours, to occur unsupervised at a public place. On such a week, Sunday access shall be from 8.00am to 4.00pm instead.

### Maintenance

18     I turn to the issue of maintenance to be paid by the Husband. I saw no basis for _spousal_ maintenance to be ordered in this case given that the Wife had always earned and still does earn more than the Husband, and will receive a substantial share of the matrimonial assets. I declined to make any order in favour of the Wife.

19     As for maintenance for the _children_, the parties accepted that the children’s ongoing monthly needs amounted to some $2,500[^5]. In addition to his contribution toward that amount, the Wife contended that the Husband ought to be ordered to pay towards big ticket health- or education-related expenses. I did not agree, noting that the list of expenses of the children already included medical, insurance and educational expenses.

20     I decided to order that the Husband paid the sum of $1,400 per month for the maintenance of all 3 children. This would be with no obligation to make further contributions toward big ticket items now within contemplation. It would also be inclusive of insurance for the second son. The Husband was to transfer the second son’s insurance policy to the Wife as policyholder and would no longer as responsible for the premiums. With these considerations, the sum of $1,400 per month would largely correspond with the parties’ income levels as stated in their respective affidavits.

21     The Wife also sought other payments which I was not prepared to order. I found that the allegation of non-payment of maintenance in May 2018 was not substantiated. As for the claim for backdated maintenance of $6,600 from 1 November 2017, I had noted the Wife’s provision for the children when assessing their indirect contributions and decided against making an order specifically addressing this.

### The Orders

22     Arising from the above, I made the following orders:

> 1.    The parties shall have joint custody of the three children of the marriage and the Wife is to have care and control over them.

> 2.    The Husband shall have access to the three children as follows:

>> (a)    Weekend access from 8.00am to 6.00pm every Sunday. Such access shall be supervised in that it must be in the presence of another adult.

>> (b)    Weekday access every alternate week. The Husband shall have unsupervised access to the three children on one weeknight for 2 hours and in public places. Where this occurs, weekend access that Sunday shall be from 8.00am to 4.00pm instead.

>> (c)    The need for access to be supervised is to be reviewed in 9 months.

> 3.    The Husband is to pay the Wife $1,400 per month for the maintenance of the 3 children of the marriage on the 1st day of the month with effect from 1 May 2019 into an account designated by the Wife.

> 4.    There shall be no order of maintenance for the Wife.

> 5.    The Husband shall transfer the Aviva insurance policy no. “\[xxx\]” (life assured: \[B\]) from himself as policyholder to the Wife as policyholder.

> 6.    The matrimonial home valued at $360,000 is to be divided in the proportion of 60% to the Plaintiff (“the Wife”) and 40% to the Defendant (“the Husband”).

> 7.    The matrimonial home at “\[address redacted\]” is to be divided in the proportion of 60% to the Wife and 40% to the Husband. To effect the division, the Husband’s rights, title and interests in the matrimonial home shall be wholly transferred to the Wife upon the Wife paying the Husband the sum of $144,000. Thereupon, the Husband shall by himself make the full required Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) refunds. The transfer shall be carried out within 3 months of Final Judgment.

> 8.    The Registrar/Assistant Registrar of the Family Justice Courts is empowered to execute, sign or indorse all necessary documents relating to the transfer of the matrimonial home on behalf of either party under Section 31 of the Family Justice Act, should either party fail to do so within seven days of a written request being made to the other party.

> 9.    Each party is to retain all other assets in their sole names.

> 10.    Liberty to apply.
