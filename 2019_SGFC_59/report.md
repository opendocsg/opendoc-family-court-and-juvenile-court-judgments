Family Law – Care and control – Relocation

31 May 2019

### District Judge Miranda Yeo Eng Joo:

## Introduction

1       This case involves a boy who was about 18 months old at the time of the hearing (the “Child”). The Plaintiff is the Child’s mother (the “Mother”) while the Defendant is the Child’s father (“the Father”). The Mother and the Father have never been married to each other. The Mother applied (through FC/OSG84/201) to be granted sole custody, care and control of the Child, for the Father to be granted access to the Child on specific days and at specific times and for liberty to leave Singapore and return to her home in Brazil and/or New York with the Child. In response to the Mother’s application, the Father filed an application (FC/SUM 2103/2018) for joint custody, shared care and control of the Child, and for an order that both parties shall not remove and/or relocate out of Singapore with the Child without the other party’s written consent or the Court’s leave. In addition, the Father also applied (through FC/SUM 2104/2018) for an injunction to restrain the Mother from removing the Child from Singapore without leave of Court or without consent of the Father, for orders with respect to the child’s passports and for interim unsupervised access.

2       I ordered that the Mother and the Father are to have joint custody and shared care and control of the Child. Orders were made on when each parent was to have care and control of the Child. The care and control orders included orders with respect to overseas travel with the child and when each parent is to have public holiday time with the child. The Mother’s application for relocation was refused. Orders were also made for both parents not to remove the Child from Singapore without the other parents’ consent or without an order of court, in relation to the Child’s passports, in relation to applications for other citizenships and passports for the Child and for the Father to pay the Mother the sum of $6,500 per month as maintenance for the Child (in accordance with existing maintenance orders).

3       In her notice of appeal, the Mother stated that she was appealing against my decision as follows –

(1)     the refusal to grant her leave to relocate with the Child;

(2)     the decision to grant both parents shared cared and control of the Child;

(3)     the overseas time of the Father with the Child;

(4)     the amount of time the Mother is allowed to travel overseas; and

(5)     the age of the Child to be allowed to travel.

4       The reasons for my decisions are set out in these grounds of decision.

## Parties

5       The Mother was born in Brazil is a citizen of Brazil and the United States of America (“USA”). The Father was born in Australia and is a citizen of Australia and Britain. The Child was born in Singapore in 2017 and is a citizen of Australia, USA and Brazil. The Mother is in Singapore on a long term visit pass while the Father works as a trader with a bank in Singapore. The parents ceased living together on 22 February 2018.

## Existing orders in relation to the Child

6       Prior to the hearing of the custody, care and control and relocation applications, the Mother obtained a consent order wherein the Father agreed to pay the Mother $4,000 per month as maintenance for the Child with effect from 16 April 2018 pursuant to Maintenance Order No. MO195/2018 dated 28 March 2018.

7       On 18 June 2018, pursuant to a mediation session, the parties agreed to the following interim orders in relation to the Child (“the Interim Order”) -

(1)     The Father shall have access to the Child on Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays from 10 am to 2 pm and on Saturdays from 10 am to 4 pm alternating with Sundays from 10 am to 4 pm. During such access the Mother and/or the Mother’s mother may accompany the Father and the Child.

(2)     In addition to the sum of $4,000 per month being maintenance paid pursuant to MO 195/2018, the Father shall pay the further sum of $2,500 per month towards the child’s costs of accommodation, with effect from 27 June 2018.

(3)     The Father shall not, whether directly or indirectly, take any steps to have the Mother’s Long Term Visit Pass revoked.

(4)     The Mother shall hand over the Child’s passport to her solicitors, by 20 June 2018. The Mother’s solicitors shall hold the passport pending the resolution of this matter and release the same pursuant to the mutual agreement of the parties or, alternatively, pursuant to an Order of Court.

(5)     The Father shall not take any steps in applying for a United Kingdom Passport for the Child while the Mother shall not take any steps in applying for a Brazilian passport for the Child.

## The Evidence Admitted for the Applications

8       The following affidavits were considered for the applications –

(1)     The Mother’s 1st affidavit filed in support of the application in OSG 84/2018 on 2 May 2018 (“P1”);

(2)     The Father’s affidavit in support of FC/SUM 2103/2018 and FC/SUM 2104/2018 and in reply to P1 filed 14 June 2018 (“D1”);

(3)     6 affidavits filed by the Father’s friends AP, LZ, R, LL, his parents and his helper (J), on 14 June 2018 in support of the Father’s applications and in reply to P1;

(4)     The Mother’s reply affidavit to D1 and the affidavits of the Father’s friends, parents and helper filed on 26 September 2018 (“P2”); and

(5)     The Father’s reply affidavit to P2 filed 12 November 2018 (“D2”).

9       The Mother had included notarised affidavits of her parents and friends at Pages 185 to 209 of P2. At the hearing, the Mother’s Counsel clarified that the documents were filed as statements and not as affidavits to avoid the possibility of incurring the costs of having the deponents come to Singapore to be cross-examined.[^1] The Father objected to the admission of these affidavits and sworn statements on the ground that the documents were not filed as affidavits but as exhibits to the Mother’s reply affidavit in breach of Rule 650(1) of the Family Justice Rules (“FJR”) which provides that every affidavit must be filed in the Registry. The Father’s additional grounds of objection include the documents are third party statements which are hearsay evidence within the meaning of Section 32 of the Evidence Act and that there has been non-compliance with Rule 591 of the FJR for the admission of hearsay evidence, and the failure to apply for leave to file the documents after the deadline given by the Court during a case conference.[^2] The Father also highlighted the Mother’s conduct prior to the hearing which included delays and the breaching of court directions for the filing of her reply affidavits. The Mother had informed the court during a case conference that she needed more time to file her affidavits as she was taking care of the Child and was obtaining affidavits from other witnesses when the affidavits of the Mother’s parents and friends were already affirmed and notarised prior the case conference. In view of Rule 650 of the FJR and the conduct of the Mother, I did not admit Pages 185 to 209 of P2 as evidence for the hearing of the applications.

10     I also did not take into consideration documents in the Portuguese language which had translations which were not verified in accordance with the requirements of Rule 953 of the FJR.

## The Mother’s Case

11     According to the Mother,[^3] she met the Father in 2013 in New York. The Father and Mother re-connected sometime in June 2016 in Mykonos. The Mother returned to New York and then travelled to Singapore in August 2016 at the Father’s invitation. The parties travelled around South East Asia and the Mother became pregnant with the Child. The Mother discovered she was pregnant in October 2016 after she returned to New York. The Mother stated that the Father met her in London and later in New York after being informed of the pregnancy. The Mother moved to Singapore after the Father asked her to move to Singapore with him; he would marry her and help her start a business to manage and work at.

12     The Mother claimed that the Father was unhappy with the pregnancy and wanted the pregnancy to be terminated. She painted a picture of the Father as a person who was living the life of a bachelor and who was an uncaring partner and parent. According to her, the Father was irresponsible and incapable of taking care of the Child. She also alleged that the Father had been threatening to cancel her Long Term Visit Pass and to take the Child away from her and that he would often call her names in front of the Child and had no respect for her. The Mother denies the claims of the Father, his parents, his helper and his friends that the Father is an involved father who shared child-caring tasks equally and claimed that she was the one carrying out all child-rearing duties mostly on her own.

13     The Mother claimed that prior to the birth of the Child, the Father partied and drunk excessively, took drugs when he was overseas and socialised with escorts and prostitutes at Orchard Towers at least once a week when he was in Singapore. The Mother also alleged that the Father continued to party, drink excessively and take drugs even after the Child was born. He took the Mother and Child to Mykonos when the Child was almost 3 months old so that he could party, leaving the Mother, Child and their helper in the hotel room and returning to the room heavily intoxicated after sunrise or behaving erratically under the suspected influence of drugs. The Mother claimed that the Father went night clubbing when they were in New York with the Child a few weeks later to attend a wedding and that she personally witnessed for the first time the Father sniffing cocaine in the living room of the Airbnb apartment they were renting. The Mother said this was the breaking point in their relationship; she lost all trust in the Father and they began to drift apart.

14     The Mother started planning for her exit from the relationship in New York and convinced the Father to buy US$5,000 worth of wholesale dresses so that she could start her own business and not rely on him.[^4]

15     In December 2017, the parties and the Child travelled to Brazil for 2 weeks over the Christmas holidays. The Mother stayed back in Brazil for surgery as she was experiencing pain caused by her breast implants. The Mother claimed that the Father demanded that she returned to Singapore with the Child and did not care when the Mother told him that she was advised by her doctor that she should not travel or lift anything heavy for 30 days whilst she was in the recovery stage. The Mother allegedly returned to Singapore with the Child after a 36-hour journey on a flight arranged by the Father when she was very sick.

16     Upon the Mother’s return to the Father’s apartment in Marina Bay (“the Marina apartment”) on 14 February 2018, she noticed that her pictures were hidden in a drawer and asked the Father if he had been unfaithful. She also chanced upon messages from multiple women on the Father’s phone, including one from a woman in Hong Kong who planned to visit the Father in Singapore because he had invited her to do so. The Father did not explain when the Mother questioned him and left the Marina apartment on 22 February 2018, marking the end of the relationship.

17     After the Father left the Marina apartment, the Mother obtained a by consent maintenance order for the Father to pay maintenance for the Child and the parties agreed to the Interim Order at a mediation session. The parties had issues with access since the making of the Interim Order. Prior to the Interim Order, the Mother claimed that the Father had been difficult in relation to access. He insisted on seeing the Child every day, giving her barely 15 to 20 minutes’ advance notice. The Mother would be forced to return with the Child if she was out of the apartment as the Father would threaten to take the Child away from her and have her visa cancelled. After the Interim Order was made, the parties could not agree on how Clause (1) of the Interim Order was to be interpreted. The Mother insisted on supervising access while the Father insisted that the Interim Order was not one of supervised access. This led to fights and a further deterioration of the parties’ relationship. The Father would call the Mother names and hurl vulgarities at her and call her mentally ill. The Mother accused the Father of attacking her in front of the Child twice in the Marina apartment and insisted on access being at a public place or her Eunos apartment, a place which she moved to after the Father forced her and the Child out of the Marina apartment in June 2018. Since 4 September 2018, the Father called the police 3 times to allege that the Mother was in breach of the Interim Order when the Mother claimed that she was simply exercising her rights under the Interim Order.[^5]

18     The Mother gave the following reasons for applying for leave to relocate with the Child[^6] –

(1)     The Mother had become financially dependent on the Father and the Father was cutting off his financial support for her. The Father had terminated her credit cards leaving her with one card with a maximum credit limit of $1,000. As the parties are not married, the Mother does not have a right to ask for financial support from the Father for herself. The Father had given her $50,000 to start a business but she had no experience working in Singapore and did not know where to begin. In any event, $50,000 was insufficient to sustain a business in her line of work in fashion sales and cosmetology and she cannot run a business or open a bank account as a visitor.

(2)     The Father had been threatening to cancel the Mother’s visit pass and to take the Child away from her. When the Mother was applying for a maintenance order (MO195/2018), the Father allegedly threatened to take the Child from the Mother if she did not allow him to travel to Australia with the Child, to throw the Mother out of the Marina apartment, to cancel her visit pass and to ship her back to New York without the Child.

(3)     The Father was vindictive and used his financial means to get back at the Mother. When the Mother refused to travel with the Father to Australia with the Child as she was concerned about having the Child taken away from her, the Father cancelled the Mother’s mother’s (“Maternal Grandmother”) flight from Brazil to Singapore which he had agreed to fund.

(4)     The Mother was at the Father’s mercy so long as she remained in Singapore where she had no relatives, friends or any means of moral or emotional support. The Mother was using the $50,000 the Father gave her for her personal expenses and she would not be able to support herself once the money ran out.

(5)     Since the application for sole custody, care and control and for relocation was filed, the Father has been exhibiting resentment and hostility towards the Mother and a clear refusal to co-operate with her. He insisted on having his way and will think of ways to punish her when she did not give in. He forced the Child and the Mother out of the Marina apartment by demanding that the Mother either vacate the Marina apartment or take over the rental of $6,500 per month and security deposit of $12,400 knowing that the Mother had no means to do so. He refused to allow the Mother to take the Child’s crib and other items and demanded that the Mother bought her own things for her own apartment. He also demanded the return of the $50,000 which he had given her, terminated her handphone number which was registered in his name, threatened to cut down the maintenance he had agreed to pay for the Child, filed Summons No. 3093 of 2018 to reduce the agreed maintenance from $6,500 per month to $3,000 per month, called the police many times when the Mother disagreed with him on the interpretation of Clause 1 of the Interim Order on where access was to take place, and baselessly accused the Mother of being mentally ill and being an unfit and uncaring mother. The Father moved back to the Marina apartment after the Mother moved out with the Child.

(6)     Neither the Mother or the Child have adapted to life in Singapore and they have no connection to Singapore. The Mother had no family or friends to turn to for help, assistance or support in Singapore. There is nothing in Singapore for her as her relationship with the Father (which was the reason why she came to Singapore) is short lived and cannot be saved.

(7)     As the Mother has no legal rights to claim maintenance from the Father, she would have to draw down on her limited savings and it was not sustainable for her to rely on the generosity of her family, church friends and strangers to get by. The Father kicked the Mother and Child out of the Marina apartment and forced the Mother to fend for herself. Even if the Father started voluntary payments for the Mother’s expenses, the Mother had no security as the Father could stop voluntary payments anytime.

(8)     The Father is unable to co-operate or co-parent with her and refuses to be reasonable. The Mother is unable to put up with the Father’s threats, psychological torture and financial abuse anymore.

(9)     The Mother cannot work while on a Long Term Visit Pass and cannot sign for a lease, apply for utilities or a telephone line. She is unable to obtain a Dependant’s Pass as she is not married to the Father and would not qualify for permanent residency or an Employment Pass on account of her low educational qualifications (as she only has a high school diploma). Her right to remain in Singapore long term is precarious.

(10)     The Mother claimed that she had difficulties getting accommodation in Singapore as she was unable to sign a lease for an apartment with a Long Term Visit Pass. A friend, AF, asked her friend to sign a lease for an apartment in Eunos for AF and for the Mother and the Child. AF was going through divorce proceedings.

(11)     The Mother is unable to bear the expenses for the Child if the Father succeeded in reducing the maintenance payable for the Child.

(12)     The Mother and the Child have no rights in Singapore as they are not citizens e.g. to free healthcare and education.

(13)     The Mother will not be able to afford to pay for the Child’s school fees in Singapore if the Father should refuse for pay for it, and the Child’s education and future will be compromised.

(14)     The Child is not thriving in Singapore and has lost weight and has delayed development when the Father left the Marina apartment and the parents’ relationship deteriorated. The Child has experienced a lot of changes and is affected by the Father’s angry behaviour towards the Mother and started refusing to eat properly.

(15)     The Child is attached to the Maternal Grandmother and has daily video calls with her. He is also close to the Maternal Grandfather. The Maternal Grandfather will retire with 2 pensions in 2 years’ time and will be present in the Child’s life. Living in Brazil will give the Child and the Mother the benefit of having her parents to help care for the Child when the Mother does back to school and later to work. Furthering her education will allow the Mother to have better work opportunities in the future.

(16)     If forced to stay in Singapore, the Mother can only be a stay-at-home mother, unable to work and forced to wait for the Father to spend a few hours each week with the Child. The Mother will not be able to thrive in her education or career. She will not be able to see or spend time with her parents as she is unable to sponsor dependent passes for them and it would be too difficult and costly to fly them to and from Singapore.

(17)     As for the Father’s offer to help her start a business in Singapore, any business would have to be in the name of the Father as the Mother is a Long Term Visit Pass Holder. The Mother would be the Father’s employee and be at his mercy.

(18)     Singapore was never meant to be a permanent home for the Mother and the Child. The Mother suffers from prejudice in Singapore for being a single, unwed mother with a son born out of wedlock and the Mother fears this will compromise the Child having friends in the future.

(19)     The Child engages mostly with Brazilian children and will not be able to form lasting friendships as their time in Singapore is transient and dependant on their parents’ posting.

(20)     It is a matter of time before the Father starts a new relationship, settles down, gets married and have other children. When this happens, he will lose interest in being in the Child’s life and will not want to pay the amount of maintenance he is paying currently. It is perilous to the Child and the Mother’s interests that they be forced to remain in Singapore until the Father loses interest in them.

(21)     A major bugbear in the parents’ relationship concerns money. The Father seems to think the Mother is after him for his money. The Mother is certain that the relationship will be less acrimonious when she has the means to support herself.

(22)     The Father has no ties to Singapore. He was born in Australia and is an Australian and British citizen. He is currently on an employment pass. There is no guarantee that the Father will remain in Singapore long term. No one can vouch for the stability of his job in Singapore or whether he will be posted to another country. If the Father loses his job, he would have to relocate and it will be much harder for the Child to relocate and adapt when he is older.

19     The Mother’s plan in P1 was to relocate to New York. She lived almost a third of her life in New York and has a huge network of close friends who are like family. She can easily find work, get an apartment, a car and a nanny whilst she worked. She could also get her mother to fly to New York more easily to help with the Child and have back up nanny support in the form of her former housekeeper. The Mother claimed that her friend, JD, had offered her the rent free use of a 2,000 square foot house in Oyster Bay 24 miles away from New York City and unrestricted use of a car for a period of one year to help her get back on her feet. The Mother claimed that she only has a high school diploma and does not have the sort of education that would enable her to make a decent living as a fashion sales associate and cosmetologist in Singapore where the authorities are tightening up on the number of foreigners being allowed to work here. She used to earn US$6,000 a month in New York. She has friends and network connections built up over the years in New York and getting a job or freelance work in New York would not be a problem.

20     After the filing of D1, the Mother decided against going back to New York. In P2, the Mother stated that she had decided to return to Brazil to be with her family. She intends to work with her father in their disposal and recycling of scrap metal business and attend college at night. She has a network she built up being a model and can easily find a job after graduation. Living in Brazil would give the Child the benefit of having the Maternal Grandparents to look after the Child when the Mother is at school and later at work. The Mother obtained a Home Visit Report from a Guardianship Counsellor in Brazil stating that the parents’ residence is large, well-built and well maintained, there are 2 additional bedrooms for the Mother and the Child, the residence is in a quiet neighbourhood, the Maternal Grandmother is willing to take care of the Child and the Maternal Grandparents have the financial means to care for the Mother and the Child and are willing to have the Mother and the Child live with them. The Mother stated that in addition to the Maternal Grandparents, her extended family, friends and neighbours will provide an extended network of support for her and the Child.

21     The Mother’s plan was to have the Child attend an international school called Maple Bear Vila Velha in her hometown so that he can be immersed in the English culture and learn English. The Mother claims that she has checked with the school and has been told that the Child is assured of a place when he turns 4 years old. The Mother says she will be able to afford the school fees even if the Father stops his maintenance payments. The Child will be able to have a more comfortable life in Brazil as the cost of living is lower. He will be able to travel and attend international schools and enrichment classes at half the costs when compared to Singapore. The Mother admits that her hometown has had some riots and violence issues which she is not able to control.[^7] However, whilst Brazil may not be perceived to be as safe as Singapore, the Child will not run the risk of being homeless or have his care delegated to a helper or strangers.

22     The Mother proposed to allow the Father to have daily Skype or Facetime access to the Child for 30 minutes each time and to have liberal physical access to the Child in Brazil provided he gives 4 weeks’ notice and the Child’s schooling is not affected. Alternatively, the Father can fly the Mother and the Child to Singapore, Sydney or any other country of his choice for access of up to 2 weeks each time on giving 4 weeks’ notice and paying for the air tickets, accommodation and other expenses. When the Child turns 7, the Father can have continuous access for a period of 2 weeks each time upon giving not less than 4 weeks’ notice and the Father paying for the Child’s air tickets, accommodation and other expenses.

23     The Mother sought sole custody, care and control of the Child on the ground that her relationship with the Father was such that joint custody would pose a problem if she needed to consult the Father on milestone decisions concerning the Child as they would not be able to reach consensus. The Mother claimed that the Father never asked about the Child’s wellbeing whenever he travelled. She also alleged that the Father is in no position to take care of the Child as he lives the life of the bachelor, is fond of parties, the opposite sex and recreational drugs. The Father travels frequently and has a stressful life as a trader working from 3 pm to midnight. The Mother claimed that the Father neither has the ability, nor the facility or inclination to take care of the Child. The Mother claimed that she was the Child’s primary caregiver and that the Father played a limited role and was never interested in being a father. The Mother also wanted sole custody as she fears that the Father will refuse to consent to or sign important documents such as applying for a Brazilian passport for the Child, and documents in relation to the renewal of the Child’s various passports and acceptance into schools.

24     The Mother wants the Father to have supervised access to Child whether in Singapore, New York or Brazil on specified days and hours. The Mother insisted on supervised access as she says that the fact that the Father stayed in 14 places after leaving the Marina apartment shows his life is a mess, that the Child’s safety may be compromised when the Father is using recreational drugs and is drinking excessively and as the Father is irresponsible, leaving the Child in his stroller facing the front door on 26 April 2018 instead of returning the Child to the Mother personally after access (“the stroller incident”).

25     The Mother stated that after the events following the Interim Order, she had no trust or faith that the Father will change and be able to co-operate and co-parent with her. She felt strongly about accompanying the Child for access as the Child is very young and is unable to express himself. The Mother alleged that the Father did not know how to handle the Child or to properly see to all his needs. The Father always relied on others, especially the Mother, to assist. The Mother claimed that the Father was more interested in spending time at the gym, partying, drinking and getting drunk. He would shy away from taking care of the Child and only started to be more engaged after she filed the present application. The Mother claimed that the Father will delegate the care of the Child to others if the Child was with him.[^8]

26     The Mother alleged that the Father did not take care of the Child when they were together and only started performing the child caring tasks after he left in February 2018 and she imposed regulated access. The Mother stated that the Father simply would not have the energy to work long hours and perform child rearing tasks in the few hours that he was awake before going to work.[^9] He also stopped attending the Child’s paediatric appointments until the present application was filed.[^10] She also claimed that the Father was actually house hunting and managing his properties and tenants during the time when he claimed he was taking care of the Child.[^11]

27     The Mother doubts the Father’s claim that his parents could assist in taking care of the Child as the Paternal Grandmother has to take care of the Paternal Grandfather who has fairly severe dementia and the Father’s 6-year-old niece in Australia. The Mother exhibited a text message from Father confirming that the Paternal Grandfather has dementia.[^12]

28     The Mother denies all claims by the Father’s helper, J, that the Father was a hands-on father who took care of the Child in the mornings before he went to work. She stated that the Child was taken care of by her and that J would usually be the designated baby sitter for the short times when she was away from the Child for doctor or dentist appointments.[^13] The Mother asked the Father to pay her the $2,000 per month which he was paying J since the Mother was doing the cleaning up and as J was not helping out. The Father got enraged and threatened to cancel her visa and harm her legally.[^14]

29     In relation to the Father’s claim that he tried to ensure that the Mother had a network of friends to rely on in Singapore, the Mother stated that she blocked off the Father’s friends as they never offered her support and have taken the Father’s side.[^15] She says that the friends who filed affidavits for the Father are biased and are clueless as to the Father’s actual abilities as a father. She has made friends with other Brazilians and Singaporeans who are church goers and who have embraced her as part of their community and assisted her when she had to move out from the Marina apartment without the Child’s items.[^16]

30     The Mother responded to the Father’s allegations in relation to her care of the Child by stating that the Child lost a tooth when he slipped during the time when the Mother was moving to the Eunos apartment, that the Child’s big toe was hurt as a result of an accident and that the doctor has confirmed that the Child was healthy although he was on the small side.[^17] In relation to the Father’s allegations that the Mother had psychological issues, the Mother exhibited medical reports from two doctors confirming that she is able to have care and control of the Child. The psychiatrist in USA stated that he saw the Mother for psychotherapy during 2014 to 2016. He saw the Mother again in the beginning of 2018 through video sessions. He stated that the Mother displayed symptoms of post-traumatic stress with a severely violent and abusive marriage but she has resolved the problem though medications and psychotherapy. His opinion was that the Mother does not require any kind of mental health treatment save a supportive intervention to assist her in facing the challenges of having mothered a child with an intemperate man. The Singapore psychiatrist’s opinion was that he could not detect any major psychiatric disorder or personality disorder from the Mother’s 3 visits to see him.[^18] The Mother denies that she is emotionally unstable and states that she is able to take care of the Child and her home on her own besides taking the Child to his swimming classes and play groups.[^19]

31     The Mother stated that she underwent great physical and psychological abuse when she was married to an American citizen and had been on medication to help her deal with her trauma. She denies the Father’s allegation that she was had used drugs to deal with her depression and anxiety and had overdosed on drugs. She also denies the Father’s friend, AP’s allegations that she had a history of drug use and had wanted to take drugs while on holiday in Brazil.

32     In relation to the Father’s allegation that she lost her temper over minor matters, the Mother admitted that she did lose her temper but claimed that it was because the Father would drink heavily when he was with his cousin while they were in New York. She apologised to the Father for throwing champagne at him at an office event because she was worried about retaliation by the Father.[^20]

## The Father’s Case

33     The Father confirmed that he met the Mother at a party in New York in August 2013. He was living in London at that time and relocated to Singapore in October 2015 to be closer to his family in Australia. He joined his employers’ Singapore office as Managing Director.

34     The Father got back in touch with the Mother through social media in June 2016 and agreed to meet in Mykonos, Greece in July 2016 where he was on holiday with a group of friends. The Father invited the Mother to visit him in Singapore in September 2016.

35     The Father claimed that the Mother told him that she was previously married to an American citizen and had obtained US citizenship through that marriage. According to the Father, the Mother informed him that she had a long history of depression and had been undergoing therapy for 10 years, that she took medication for “anxiety” and “drinking”,[^21] that her depression caused her to develop a cocaine addiction and she had completed therapy at a drug rehabilitation clinic, that she worked as a model in New York for 10 years and was looking to relocate to somewhere warmer and with an easier pace of life and that she had been looking for a reason to leave New York after completing her drug rehabilitation therapy.

36     On 11 October 2016, the Mother informed the Father that she was pregnant and that he was the father of the unborn child. The Father said he took responsibility and told the Mother he would support her whether she chose to have the child or not. He did not try to persuade the Mother to terminate the pregnancy. The Father stated that the Mother eventually decided to move to Singapore to live with the him and to raise the Child together because she trusted him.

37     The Father admitted that he visited night clubs in London and New York with the Mother while she was pregnant but denies the Mother’s allegations that he was drunk and had taken drugs. The Father disagreed with the Mother’s account of the trip to Mykonos with the Child and that he was partying and taking drugs in Mykonos. The first part of the trip involved only the parties and the Child in Santorini as the Father wanted to spend time alone with the family. For the second part of the trip, the Father invited some of their friends, including R and AP, as he thought it would be good for the Mother to socialise more with their friends. The Father claimed that the trip to Greece was a time where he spent with the family and that he took care of the Mother when she was feeling ill. The Father denied taking drugs in New York as alleged by the Mother and said that they had gone to bed at about 3 am and took pictures of them playing with the Child as a family. The Father exhibited the photographs taken that night in his affidavit.[^22] The Father stated that the Mother enjoyed traveling and has a very expensive shopping habit, incurring a shopping bill of $7,000 on the supplementary card from the Father while they were in New York.[^23]

38     As for the visit to Brazil in February 2018, the Father confirmed that the Mother stayed back in Brazil for medical treatment. She had informed him that she was very unwell and was not well enough to travel or even carry the Child. The Mother asked the Father for money to pay for her medical treatment. That same day, she posted pictures of herself in active wear on social media, going for hikes in the mountain side and carrying the Child.

39     The Father denies socialising with escorts and prostitutes at Orchard Towers and returning home intoxicated. He had only been to Orchard Towers twice since living with the Mother, once to host colleagues visiting from Korea and once with the Mother after watching the Formula One race in 2017.

40     The Father claimed that the Mother reneged on her promise to take the Child to Australia in March 2018 for the Father’s birthday celebrations and for Child to visit the Father’s family over the Easter holidays. The Father alleged that the Mother refused to got to Australia unless he increased maintenance from $4,000 per month to $6,000 per month. When he refused to give in to her request, the Mother refused to go to Australia and refused to allow the Child to go to Australia, wasting the tickets which the Father had already bought.

41     The Father paints a picture of a mother who is emotionally unstable and is incapable of taking care of the Child alone. He claims that it was the Mother who lost her temper over minor matters such as the Father being caught in traffic with his cousin when they were in New York for a wedding. The Mother used abusive language in her messages to the Father during the incident.[^24] The Mother stormed off with the Child at the Athens airport after the Mykonos trip after she got angry with the Father’s comments that ignoring him was not helpful. When they reached Istanbul for the connecting flight, the Mother said that she wanted to go to New York with the Child. The Father had to call his sister in Australia who then calmed both the Father and Mother down and the Mother agreed to board the flight to Singapore.

42     The Father stated that the Mother is emotionally unstable and paranoid about his feelings for her. She constantly accused the Father of engaging in relationships with other women even though she had no evidence to support her belief. The Father exhibited the message from his friend SK which the Mother had seen and had become paranoid over to show that the messages were not flirtatious but the Mother refused to believe that he was not seeing SK.[^25]

43     The Father also alleged that the Mother drinks heavily and gets drunk from time to time to the point where she passes out. On 23 November 2017, the parties were hosting a dinner party with their Brazilian friends and the Mother drank until she passed out and vomited. The Child was 6 months old at that time and the Father spent the night cleaning the Mother up, mopping up her vomit and taking care of both the Mother and the Child. The Father alleged that the Mother’s heavy drinking is often accompanied by impulsive and unreasonable behaviour. On the 6 December 2017, the Mother, for no apparent reason, threw a full glass of champagne in the Father’s face at a work function in front of his colleagues. When asked about the incident the next day, the Mother apologised and said that she wanted to get the Father’s attention and that she was uncomfortable because the Father was talking to one of the women at the dinner. The Father exhibited a copy of the parties’ text messages on 7 December 2017 where the Mother admitted she was drunk and said that she will stop drinking.[^26]

44     The Father claimed that he was aware that the Mother takes anti-depressants to calm her down and help her resist the urge to do things impulsively. The Mother had admitted to him before that she was depressed. The therapist whom the parties consulted for joint therapy also told the Father that the Mother showed signs of depression due to her childhood and family background. The Father expressed concern over the Mother’s mental health history and extreme reactions to various situations and does not feel safe leaving the Child in the Mother’s sole care and control.

45     The Father stated that he has a very strong bond with the Child. The Father claimed that as the Mother was only partially breast-feeding, he was actively helping to take care of the Child, including preparing the formula and feeding him. The Father said that the parties had a shift-work arrangement where the Father would perform most of the childcare tasks on weekdays from the morning before going to work at 3pm. The Mother would then take care of the Child from 3pm onwards until he slept. The helper, J, would manage the household chores throughout the day and step in to look after the Child from time to time. As the Father would take care of the Child in the day, the Mother would at times use the opportunity to go out with her friends. She also went to the gym daily in the mornings. Prior to the relationship turning sour, the Mother never had an issue with the Father being alone with the Child. The Father said he would settle the Child’s entire routine when he was alone with the Child, including preparing his milk formula, feeding him, burping him, bathing him, changing his diaper and putting him to sleep. The Father would also go to the pool regularly with the Child.

46     The Father stated that he was a hands-on parent who insisted on doing the childcare tasks himself even though the helper offered to assist him. He believed it was important for fathers to be involved in the development of their children and to take care of their children physically, not just financially. The Father tried to learn new things to increase his usefulness in bringing up the Child including obtaining advice from the helper, J, on how to help the Child to burp. Whenever the parties had barbeques or parties at their place, the Father would bring the Child along and carry him in the baby carrier for convenience. The Father would put the Child to bed or get him to stop crying. The parties were able to leave the Child with each other alone.

47     Even after the separation, the Father had unsupervised access to the Child and would regularly take the Child to various places on his own. The Mother refused to provide unsupervised access after the stroller incident. The Father explained that he was standing at the side of the corridor as he did not wish to see the Mother or fight with her in front of the Child. He did not leave until the Child was brought in.

48     The Father denies that he was an uncaring and irresponsible partner. He paid for the Mother’s medical care when she was pregnant, stayed with Mother when she went into labour, attended almost every routine obstetrician appointment and helped with the shopping for the Child’s furniture, clothes and necessities. He also arranged and paid for the Maternal Grandmother to come to Singapore when the Child was born. The Father arranged for house viewing when they were in Australia as the parties had discussed a possible life in Australia together but the Mother was not interested in house viewing. He arranged for the parties and the Child to go on trips as he knew that the Mother liked travelling. After the Mother complained about not getting a bassinet seat for the Child when returning from Mykonos, the Father spent extra money to fly the parties and the Child on business class for the subsequent long haul flights to New York and Brazil.

49     The Father helped the Mother to set up a bank account and loaned her the sum of $50,000 to start a business to help her to start earning income. He also provides monthly maintenance (initially of $4,000 per month and later $6,500 per month) for the Child which he believed is more than what the Child needs.

50     The Father acknowledged that the Mother does not family members in Singapore. He claimed that he tried to ensure the Mother had a network of friends to rely on in Singapore. The parties had a mutual Brazilian friend, AP, who was well connected with the Brazilian community in Singapore. The Father believed AP added the Mother to a WhatsApp group where Brazilian girls chatted in Portuguese. The Mother however has gone to the extent of blocking several of the Brazilians on social media, including AP. The Father believes that the Mother has made a close group of friends in her church and would be able to form a strong network of friends in Singapore.

51     If the Mother left Singapore, the Father was willing to accept care and control of the Child and allow the Mother to have reasonable access. He is prepared to pay for her trips to Singapore subject to a maximum of 2 trips per year.[^27] The Father objects to the Mother relocating with the Child. The Father stated that Singapore is a safe environment for a young child to grow up in. There is no compelling reason to uproot the Child into a more dangerous environment such as Brazil, or an unsupported one such as New York, especially since the Child will have daily access to two parents here.

52     The Father gave the following other reasons why it is in the Child’s best interest to remain in Singapore[^28] –

(1)     The Father has job stability. He has been working for the same bank for 13 years and is now a managing director. His employers have given him the green light to work flexible hours and also from home. The Father’s employers have indicated that his job is highly secure.

(2)     The Father has a good helper, J, who is able to take care of the Child while he is at work.

(3)     The Father has large network of friends in Singapore.

(4)     The Father’s parents, who have experience taking care of the Father’s niece, have stated that they are willing to come to Singapore regularly to look after the Child.

(5)     The healthcare facilities in Singapore are outstanding and both the Mother and the Child have free healthcare in Singapore through the Father’s work healthcare insurance even though the Mother and Father are separated.

(6)     The Child will be able to have access to a high standard of education in Singapore and the Father has the ability to pay for all of the Child’s educational expenses comfortably.

(7)     The Mother does not need to worry about the cost of living as the Father is willing and able to cover the Child’s living expenses in Singapore.

(8)     The Child has adapted to life in Singapore since he was born in Singapore and has been growing up in Singapore for his formative years. He has a routine and lifestyle in place.

(9)     The Mother has a Brazilian support network here in Singapore. She currently lives with her Brazilian friend and attends a Brazilian church. The Child also attends a children’s play group for Brazilian children and engages with Brazilian children.

(10)     The Father intends to settle in Singapore and is in the process of applying for permanent residency status.

53     The Father was of the opinion that moving the Child to New York or Brazil was not viable and will not be in the Child’s best interest. The Father’s concerns regarding the Mother’s proposals to relocate to New York or Brazil are as follows[^29] -

(1)     The Father doubted the Mother’s plan to get the Maternal Grandmother to live with her in New York to look after the Child given the relationship between the Mother and her parents, the Maternal Grandmother’s emotional state, difficulties travelling and inability to speak English. The Mother could not stay even 2 weeks with her parents in Brazil. The Mother could not leave the Child with the Maternal Grandmother alone as planned as the Maternal Grandmother had a nervous breakdown and appeared to be still suffering from the murder of her son. When the Mother remained in Brazil for her surgery, she had a major falling out with her parents and messaged to the Father to say that she can no longer stay with her parents, that the Maternal Grandmother has abused her physically and emotionally and that she did not want the Child to be near the Maternal Grandmother ever again.[^30]

(2)     The Father also doubted the Mother’s plan to have her former housekeeper as a backup nanny in New York. The housekeeper is a full time professional house cleaner in Manhattan who if employed as a full time nanny would be a considerable expense.

(3)     The Father highlighted that the Mother has not shown any evidence that she had a stable monthly income of US$6,000 in New York as his understanding was that the Mother’s income as a model was unpredictable and unstable. If the Mother moved to New York, it would be hard to believe that her income would be able to sustain her as she would have to pay for high rent, her own bills and her nanny. Moving the Child to New York will leave him with a sole parent who will be working long hours to make ends meet without any financial stability.

(4)     The Father has never heard of the Mother’s friend, JD, who had offered the Mother rent-free use of a house and car for one year if she relocated to New York. JD has never met the Child. Oyster Bay is 24 miles from New York City which raises the question of who will take care of the Child while the Mother commuted to and from and works in the city. Even if the arrangement was workable, the same issues of rent and expenses will ensue after one year.

(5)     The Mother’s hometown in Brazil is not as safe and secure as Singapore or other first world countries. The Father had observed that it was not safe when he visited Brazil. The Plaintiff’s brother was murdered in her hometown and the Father is afraid that the Child would be facing the same risk, especially if he does not have a father figure in Brazil to look out for him. The Mother herself has accused her own parents of abuse and neglect. The Father exhibited news articles about the violence and record high murder rates in Brazil. Even the Mother herself acknowledged that her hometown “has had some riots and violence issues” and that she is “not able to control” these matters. The Father finds it unacceptable to subject the Child to such risks.

(6)     The Father believes that even though the Mother’s parents’ house may be adequate by local standards, the Child’s living conditions in Brazil would be far worse than the living standards he would have if he remained in Singapore.

(7)     The Mother’s proposed access arrangement is unrealistic. The Mother’s hometown in Brazil is 40 hours by flight from Singapore and it is clearly not practical or easily accessible for the Child and the Father to have regular access.

(8)     The 14 hour-time difference between Singapore and Brazil would mean that the Father cannot call the Child in the daytime and the Child would be asleep by the time the Father is able to call him and vice versa.

(9)     In terms of language and communication, the Father’s does not speak Portuguese at all and the Mother’s parents do not speak English. The Father was unable to communicate with the Mother’s parents despite his efforts to use a translation application and trying to get the Mother to translate for him when he was in Brazil. It is clear that bringing the Child to Brazil would mean that the Child would be speaking Portuguese growing up and is unlikely to be able to speak English well. It will be difficult for the Father to communicate and bond with the Child if he moves to Brazil.

(10)     As the Mother had made access in Singapore so difficult after the Interim Order was made, the Father is certain that he will never be able to see the Child or have time alone with him if the Mother and the Child were allowed to relocate to Brazil. The Mother insists on supervising access in Singapore even though there is a safe and child friendly environment. The Mother will become even more protective and unreasonably paranoid, especially since Brazil is a more dangerous place. The Father is unfamiliar with Brazil and will have difficulties communicating with the Maternal Grandparents, the Child and the authorities if the Mother deprives him of access as he does not speak Portuguese.[^31]

(11)     The Father doubts the Mother’s claims that the Child will have the benefit of the love and support of her extended family in Brazil as he only met some distant relatives in their seventies during his stay in Brazil.

(12)     Should the Mother be allowed to relocate to Brazil with the Child, it will be a practical end to any meaningful relationship between the Father and the Child. The Father cannot speak the language and cannot work in Brazil. The Father should not be deprived of the opportunity to have an equally strong relationship with the Child.

(13)     That the Mother could change her plans abruptly and drastically from relocating to New York in her first affidavit to relocating to Brazil in her second affidavit after the Father pointed out that there was no proper parenting plan for the proposed relocation to New York shows that the Mother is more concerned about her own interests, not the Child’s interests, that she has not properly thought through her plans for relocation, that her plans were very volatile, and that the Mother did not have a serious long-term plan for herself and the Child.[^32]

(14)     The Mother has support in Singapore. She appears to get along with her neighbours and is with them almost daily based on her Schedule for the child in P2. The Mother also confirmed that the Child spends his time with Brazilian children and can understand both English and Portuguese. She has a fellow Brazilian flatmate and has Brazilian friends. She has been working in New York for many years prior to coming to Singapore and is not unused to living without family.[^33]

54     The Father’s proposed care arrangements in Singapore are as follows –

(1)     The Father will take care of the Child from 10 am to 3 pm daily except Wednesdays and Thursdays at his apartment and continue to employ the helper, J, to take care of household chores. The Child goes for swimming lessons and a Brazilian play group which consists of children of Brazilian mothers living in Singapore on Wednesdays and Thursdays. The Father is supportive of the Mother’s arrangement in relation to the playgroup as the Mother would be in weekly contact with a Brazilian mothers’ community and have community in Singapore.

(2)     If both parents have to work, J will be able to take care of the Child. The Father’s parents are committed to coming over for periods of 3 months on a tourist visa to take care of the Child.

55     The Father stated that it is crucial for the Child to grow up with both parents in the same country during his formative years. If the Child were to stay in Singapore, he will have the support of both parents, the Father’s parents who are experienced in taking care of a child and J. The Father stated he had every intention of continuing to sponsor the Mother’s visa so that both parents can be with the Child in Singapore. The Father has been a very involved parent since the Child was born and wants to continue to be involved in the Child’s life. It would be heart-breaking for both the Child and the Father if he were removed from the Child’s life. Of all the countries proposed by the parties, Singapore is the safest and has the strongest support system as the Father’s parents and J would be around to assist.

56     After the making of the Interim Order, the Father claimed that the Mother disrupted his access unnecessarily by dictating what he can or cannot do during access and by following him and recording him incessantly. He offered to reduce his hours of access to have time alone with the Child pending the hearing of the applications as he did not want the Child to be caught in the middle and witness the unpleasant incidents between the parents. The Mother insisted that the Interim Order was an order for supervised access.[^34] The Father denies the Interim Order was one for supervised access. The Father gave details of incidents where the Mother was late for access, refused to let go of the Child’s stroller and the Father had to call the police for assistance and where the Mother refused to let the Father take the Child to his residence which resulted in the Father and the Child standing in the hot sun at the Eunos condominium and the Child not eating anything. The Mother was unilaterally adding terms to the Interim Order and dictating where the Father was allowed to have access. Even after the court clarified at a hearing requested for by the Father on 27 September 2018 that the Interim Order was not one for supervised access, the Mother continued to be difficult with access. On 5 October 2018, the Father tried to leave with the Child for access and the Mother shoved the Father, unbuckled the Child out of the stroller, jumped into a taxi and left, leaving the Father with the Child’s stroller. It was only at the threat of committal proceedings that the Mother was agreeable to have access at the function room of the Marina apartment where the Father was residing.[^35]

57     The Father expressed concerns about the Child’s health while under the Mother’s care. Since the Father moved out, the Child has lost his toe nail, become underweight, been admitted to hospital and lost a tooth. The Father has also noticed scratches and bruises on the Child. He does not think the Mother is capable of taking care of the Child on her own.[^36] He highlighted that the Child’s health problems occurred after the Mother hindered the Father’s unsupervised access to the Child and caused undue stress on all the parties involved.[^37]

58     The Father took the view that the Mother was abusing her position as care parent to obstruct access to the Father and that the Mother was “supervising” access because she received legal advice that she needed to show that he was a neglectful and irresponsible father. He believed the Mother was controlling and hampering his bonding with the Child so that she could leave Singapore with him.[^38] The Father denies the Mother’s allegations that he had “attacked” her twice at his apartment in front of the Child and that he has a history of violence.[^39]

59     The Father wants joint custody of the Child so that he can take part in major decisions in the Child’s life including decisions regarding nationality, citizenship, and permanent residency as there are long term consequences for the Child that the Mother may not consider or fully appreciate such as potential tax and military service obligations.[^40] He agreed to pay a total of $6,500 per month as maintenance for the Child even though the Child was only one and a half years old with a view to allowing the Mother to stay in Singapore comfortably so that the Child can have a bond with both parents at this stage of his life.[^41] He did not ask the Mother to substantiate the amounts she asked for when the maintenance orders were made and believes that the Child’s expenses would only amount to about $3,000 per month.[^42] He is prepared to continue to pay $6,500 per month as maintenance for the Mother and the Child to be reviewed after the two years in the event the Mother and the Child remain in Singapore.[^43] His counsel submitted that he provides $6,500 per month not because he believes that the Child spends so much but because he knows the sum is adequate to sustain both the Mother and the Child.[^44]

60     The Father denies that he has been financially abusive. He continued to maintain the Mother and the Child by paying the Mother $6,500 per month despite the Mother’s lack of cooperation in facilitating unsupervised access as he wanted what is best for the Child. He only asked for the return of $50,000 which he loaned the Mother to start a business when he became aware that she had no intention of starting a business in Singapore and was using the loan on herself or her legal costs for the proceedings to remove the Child from Singapore.[^45]

61     The Father denies the Mother’s insinuations that he will “lose interest” in his own son. In his view, the Mother was being paranoid, possibly due to the fact that her own father was absent during her childhood.[^46] He also denies that he is busy travelling or working and has no time for the Child. The Father claims that he does not work excessively and as a senior member of the team, he is able to delegate tasks to juniors to complete. The Father’s direct manager has confirmed that work travels are completely optional for the Father. Of the two overseas holidays the Father had taken in 2018, one was for his sister’s wedding and the other for his best friend from London.[^47] He does not have to work on weekends and is available every morning until 3 pm for the Child.

## The Father’s witnesses’ Version of Events

62     The Father filed an affidavit by his domestic helper[^48], J, who was employed by the parties when the Child was 3 weeks old. J stated that while the Mother and Father were living together, the Father would do majority of the childcare tasks in the morning until he went to work from 3 pm while the Mother took over from the afternoon until the Child went to bed. If the Child was awake, one party would be watching the Child while the other would prepare his milk or food for the morning. There were occasions where the Mother had an appointment and the Father would be at home alone with the Child. According to J, the Father was extremely hands-on and would bathe the Child, prepare his milk formula, feed the Child, burp him thereafter, change the Child’s diaper and put the Child to bed by himself without assistance. J claims that the Father would try to spend all his time with the Child when he was home. He would take the Child alone to the pool or out for a walk or to the play centre nearby. The Father would also ask J for advice or tips on matters such as how to burp the Child.

63     The Father’s parents filed an affidavit[^49] wherein they stated that they would be available to fly to Singapore on short notice from Australia to help the Father with the Child whenever he needed it. The parents stated that they had seen the Defendant with the Child and that the Father took an active role feeding the Child, burping him, changing him and putting him to bed. The parties and the Child visited the Father’s extended family in Australia in August 2017 and October 2017. The parents stated that the parties shared child caring tasks equally. In April 2018, the parties were supposed to visit Sydney with the Child over the Easter long weekend which coincided with the Father’s 38th birthday but the Mother refused to go last minute. As the Mother refused to allow the Child to see them in Australia, the Father arranged for his parents to go to Singapore in late April. While the parents were in Singapore, they managed to spend one day with the Father and the Child before the Plaintiff imposed supervised access after accusing the Father of abandoning the Child at her front door. The parents stated that they pleaded with the Mother to allow the Father to see the Child unsupervised whilst they were in Singapore as he had specifically brought them over for that purpose but she refused and as a result they did not see the Child for the rest of the trip.

64     In addition, the Father filed affidavits from his friends. LL,[^50] a friend of the Father’s for 27 years, said that the Father loved the Child very much, was excited and proud to share the news of the Child’s birth with his friends, was a hands on parent who personally performed childcare tasks such as changing the Child’s diaper and preparing his milk bottle and was well-informed about the developmental stages of children and able to articulate how the Child has progressed.

65     R, who knew the Father since January 2017 and went to dinner parties hosted by the Father, said in his affidavit[^51] that the Father would check on the Child frequently even though he had to entertain his guests, or carry the Child in the baby carrier or pram and would retreat to the room to put the Child to bed. It appeared to R that the Mother did not have any issues leaving the Father to solely take care of the Child. R stated that it was evident from the Father’s social media account that the Father loved the Child very much as the Father would regularly post photos and videos of the Child or the Child and him. R also stated that he has never seen the Father take any form of drugs nor the Father wanting to try it. He claims that the Father confines his drinking to social gatherings and that he has never seen the Father lose control or drink excessively. It was the Mother who drank a lot during the times when they went out together. R stated that the Father only mentioned going to Orchard Towers once or twice for the novelty factor together with the Mother. R claimed that the Father does not have a habit of partying. He was in Mykonos with the parties and stated that the Father spent time taking care of the Mother and the Child when the Mother was not feeling well. The Father’s social media posts regarding the Child exhibited in R’s affidavit started from 2 June 2017 before any breakdown in the parties’ relationship and continued till 17 April (presumably in 2018 after the breakdown in the parties’ relationship).[^52]

66     LZ, a friend of the Father’s, also filed an affidavit.[^53] He met the Father and Mother at a dinner with friends in September 2016 and connected quickly with the Father as they were both commodity traders and had lived in London. LZ claims to have seen the Father interact with the Child and that on National Day 2017, the Mother was not able to soothe the Child on her own and had to rely on the Father to calm him down. LZ claimed to have spoken to the Mother after his wife saw the Mother sending a message on 14 April 2018 to a WhatsApp group consisting of church friends claiming that the Father was throwing her and her baby out of the apartment, that he was financially abusing her and that she was desperate for help. LZ met the Mother and heard her complain about the Father. LZ claimed that Mother had stated she wanted to get back with the Father and hoped that LZ could speak to the Father to ease the tensions between parties. LZ spoke to the Father a week later. LZ messaged the Mother on 4 May 2018 stating that he had spoken to the Father and heard that she was being unreasonable. The Mother told LZ to contact her lawyers. The Mother then blocked LZ, his wife and 2 other Brazilian girls from their group of friends on social media and messaging service.

67     AP, a good friend of the Father, filed an affidavit stating that she was introduced to the Father at a bar in May 2016 and was introduced to the Mother in Mykonos in July 2016 through the Father. The Father was eager that AP got to know the Mother when she moved to Singapore in September 2016 as AP was also a Brazilian and could ease and facilitate the Mother’s transition to living in a foreign country. AP introduced the Mother to her group of Brazilian friends in Singapore and created a WhatsApp group where they could communicate in Portuguese. AP claimed that after the Child was born, the Mother would visit her at her workplace when she was running errands without the Child. They would meet before 3 pm as the Child would be with the Father. The Mother had never been uncomfortable leaving the Child with the Father. AP stated that she had witnessed the Father consistently being the hands-on father changing the Child’s diapers, preparing his milk bottle, feeding him, taking him swimming and for walks and the Mother being content to leave the Child with the Father. AP said that the Mother told her that the Father was a good father who shouldered responsibility to look after the Child so that the Mother could rest and have time for herself and her friends. The Mother also sent a message to the group on 2 November 2017 telling the group that the Father is a gift from God. AP also recounted an incident where the Mother organised a dinner for their group of friends and called the Father who was working at the building opposite the apartment to come home to take care of the Child as the Child was not feeling well and could not stop crying. The Father came home and took the Child for a walk to calm him down. AP also witnessed the Father looking after the Child in Mykonos in August 2017 even though the parties had brought their helper along.

68     AP said that the Mother mentioned to her that she had depression and anxiety attacks in New York because of the high level of stress in her job as a model, retail assistant, makeup artist and hairstylist. AP also claimed that while the Mother and her were discussing a trip to Brazil, the Mother told her that her plan was to leave the Child with her parents and to have fun and to go crazy and take drugs. AP visited the Mother in hospital during her pregnancy and saw the Father accompanying the Mother in hospital. AP said that she never saw the Father take drugs or lose control over alcohol.

## Findings

69     I did not take into account the opinions of the parties, their parents, friends and helper in relation to the character of the parties and the parties’ child-caring abilities or suitability to take care of the Child as the opinions of non-expert witnesses are irrelevant. I will therefore not address the allegations and replies in relation to the opinions given by the deponents of the affidavits filed. I will, however, rely on certain factual matters stated in the affidavits of the Father’s parents, friends and helper.

70     The Mother denies the claims of the Father, his parents, his helper and his friends in their affidavits that the Father is an involved parent who shared child-caring responsibilities with her prior to the breakdown of the parties’ relationship and generally dismisses the evidence given by the Father’s friends and helper as fabrications. She claims that it was only after the Father left the Marina apartment in February 2018 that he made an effort to learn to change diapers, feed and play with the Child knowing that his actions will be under scrutiny. She claims that he is clueless about how to feed the Child and struggles with putting on a diaper and dressing the Child. She has to guide him and step in. She dismisses the Father’s efforts as a show. She says that the Father is a consummate show-off who likes to be complimented and creates a good dad persona just to be praised.

71     I find that the Father is an involved parent who shared child-caring responsibilities and that the Mother has not shown that the Father is an unsuitable caregiver for the Child. The Mother complained that the Father insisted on seeing the Child every day after he left the Marina residence in February 2018.[^54] The Father’s insistence to see the Child every day is not the action of a man who is uninvolved in the life of his child. Text messages between the parties showed that the Mother had asked the Father to take care of the Child on his own prior to the stroller incident. On 24 March 2018, the Father offered to take the Child for a walk so as to give the Mother a break. The Mother asked the Father to watch the child while she went to the shop downstairs and told the Father that the Child has not had dinner yet. On 27 March 2018 (which was a weekday) the Mother asked the Father whether he was busy at work as she would like to go to the gym and needed someone to look after the Child for an hour.[^55] By this time, the Mother had fired the helper, J, because she felt that J was covering up for the Father. The fact that the Mother would ask the Father to look after the Child when the Child has not had dinner yet is an indication that the Mother trusted the Father to take care of the Child and that the Father was capable of taking care of and feeding the Child on his own. The fact that the Mother would ask the Father to look after the Child on workday so that she could go to the gym is an indication that the Father had previously gone back to the Marina apartment to help take care of the Child during his work hours if required.

72     The Father’s friend, AP, gave an account in her affidavit of the Father being called while he was at work to return home take care of the Child. The Mother confirmed that the Child did wake up crying as the group was talking loudly and that she contacted the Father to help her get the women out since they would not leave and to help her with cleaning up. The Mother also confirmed that the Father did go back to help her out.[^56] Whether the Father went home to soothe the Child (according to AP) or to help the Mother get rid of unwanted guests who were not respectful of the fact that the Child was sleeping (according to the Mother), the undisputed fact is that the Father left work to go home when contacted to help out the matters relating to of the Child.

73     When the Father informed the Mother that he was going to have his own birthday celebration with the Child in his email dated 24 April 2018, the Mother’s response was that she was glad that he was going to have a party for the Child, that organising a birthday party is a lot of work and that now she did not have to “make one”.[^57] The Mother’s response was not that the Father was incapable of taking care of the Child or incapable of organising a celebration for the Child.

74     The Mother’s confirmation that the Father would spend an hour or so in the morning taking the Child for a swim and playing with the Child and the Mother at the pool almost daily[^58] is at odds with her claim that the Father would usually go to bed at 2 a.m. and wake up at midday and have little time to spare for the Child and the Mother.[^59] In P1, the Mother claimed that the Father wasted no time in partying the minute they arrived in Mykonos in 2017.[^60] When the Father pointed out in D1 that the first part of the trip involved only the parties and the Child as he wanted family time, the Mother then admitted the Father spent time with her and the Child but claimed that the Father abandoned them when the friends turned up.[^61]

75     As for the Mother’s claims about the Father’s drinking and drug taking, I accept the Father’s argument that it was unbelievable that the Mother would voluntarily relocate to a foreign country and live with a man who she believed was a drug addict and drank excessively.[^62] The first mention by the Mother of the Father being involved in drugs based on the documents exhibited is the Mother’s request for the Father to submit himself to a hair follicle drug test in her email to the Father dated 24 April 2018, shortly before the filing of the Originating Summons on 2 May 2018. The basis given by the Mother was that the Father was demonstrating an established behaviour of erratic behaviour by showing up at the Marina apartment when she told him that the Child was asleep.[^63] There are no contemporaneous documents or photographs exhibited in the affidavits from the Mother or the Mother’s friend, MC, whom the Mother said had witnessed the Father taking drugs, to show that the Father was taking drugs.

76     The Mother claimed that the Father’s life was in a mess when he did not settle on a place to stay after he left the Marina apartment. I note that the Father had initially moved out of his own apartment at the Mother’s request.[^64] I accept that it was reasonable for him not to commit to a lease until there was finality as to the Child’s care arrangements.[^65]

77     In relation to the Mother’s allegations that the Father had attacked her twice in front of the Child, the Mother did not provide any particulars or contemporaneous documents in relation to her allegations. She did not mention any violence in P1 when asking for sole custody, care and control and for leave to relocate. In her police report dated 4 September 2018 which she filed to facilitate the application of a Personal Protection Order after a commotion at a Starbucks outlet during access, the Mother stated that the Father “has never physically abused me or my son”.[^66]

78     I find that the Mother had mischaracterised the Father as an uncaring partner who insisted that she returned to Singapore with the Child from Brazil when she was medically advised not to travel. Contemporaneous messages between the Father and the Mother showed that the Mother was the one pressing the Father to change her flight to an earlier flight because she was upset with the Maternal Grandmother and the Maternal Grandmother’s cleaner. This was despite the Father’s advice not to do so until she had recovered as it was a very long and tiring journey back. The Mother complained to the Father about the Maternal Grandmother taking the cleaner’s side, having to do housework when she is not supposed to, not wanting to be mistreated in front of the Child, and that the Maternal Grandmother had abused her physically and emotionally for 19 years. She blames the Maternal Grandmother for her depression and did not want the Child to be near the Maternal Grandmother ever again.[^67]

79     I agree with the Father that the allegations by the Mother about his inability to care for the Child or his alleged violence are afterthoughts when these proceedings were commenced so as to support the relocation order that she wanted.[^68] I also agree with the Father’s submissions that the Mother made access very difficult so that she could have sole custody, care and control of the Child.[^69] The Mother insisted that access be at a public place like Starbucks and would not allow the Father to take the Child to a quiet place to feed[^70] even though the Mother was advised by a dietitian to provide a more relaxed atmosphere for the Child at mealtimes, to allow the Child to eat picnic style, or by sitting at the table on a booster chair, rather than in his high chair.[^71]

80     The Mother has alleged that Father was vindictive and used his financial means to get back at the Mother. In relation to the Mother’s allegation that the Father cancelled the Maternal Grandmother’s flight to Singapore when she refused to allow him to travel to Australia with the Child, based on the text messages between the parties, the Father had offered to pay for the Maternal Grandmother’s flight to Singapore if the Mother will go to Australia with the Child. Otherwise, the Father would need the money to bring his parents and sister to Singapore through the year. The Father stated that the Mother’s parents were young and will be able to watch the Child grow up while his father is old and has dementia and the Child brings a lot of happiness to him and the family. The Mother’s response was that she will buy the Maternal Grandmother’s flight.[^72] It was not a situation where the Father cancelled the Maternal Grandmother’s flight as alleged by the Mother.

81     In relation to the $50,000 which the Mother said was given to her but which the Father said was a loan to her to start a business so that the Mother can have an income, a text message dated 6 February 2018 between the parties showed that the Mother told the Father that she wanted to start a business in Brazil with her own money, that she had taken $1,000 of the money and that Father can have everything back.[^73]

82     I will address the issue of the Father taking action to exert financial pressure in response to the Mother’s actions in relation to access later in this judgment. As for the Mother’s allegation that the Father called her names in front of the Child, it would appear that the Father did use inappropriate language on the Mother. In an undated message exhibited by the Mother, the Father apologised for any names he had called her in the heat of the moment. He also said “Everyone think you’re a good mother including me.”[^74] Although there are issues in relation to the Father’s actions to exert financial pressure and use of inappropriate language on the Mother, I find that these are not sufficient to show that the Father is a unsuitable caregiver for the Child or that relocation should be allowed.

## Decision on custody, care and control

83     In _TAU v TAT_ \[2018\] SGHCF 11, the Honourable Justice Debbie Ong stated –

7    The landmark decision of the Court of Appeal in CX v CY (minor: custody and access) \[2005\] 3 SLR(R) 690 (“CX v CY”) explains the concepts of “custody” and “care and control” (at \[31\]):

… To put it simplistically, ‘care and control’ concerns day-to-day decision-making, while residual ‘custody’ concerns the long-term decision-making for the welfare of the child.

8    “Custody” thus pertains to decision-making over the major aspects of a child’s life, such as the child’s education and major healthcare issues. Following CX v CY, the grant of joint or no custody orders is the norm, while sole custody orders will only be made in exceptional circumstances, including where one parent had physically, sexually or emotionally abused the child, or where “the relationship of the parties is such that co-operation is impossible even after the avenues of mediation and counselling have been explored, and the lack of co-operation is harmful to the child”: CX v CY at \[38\]. Where joint or no custody orders are made, both parents must consult each other and co-operate to make the major decisions for the child. Such orders ensure that the child continues, even after the parent’s divorce, to have the guidance of both parents in his or her life.

9    “Care and control”, on the other hand, relates to which parent the child should live with primarily, with that parent as the daily caregiver. Consequently, that parent is generally responsible for making day-to-day decisions for the child, such as how the child is to dress or what the child is to eat. In most cases, the child will also spend regular periods of time with the other parent through an arrangement known as “access”. Access can take many forms. … When the parent with access is with the child, he or she can make some of the day-to-day decisions for the child, as it would be otherwise impractical for the parent with care and control to be consulted on every decision, such as what the child should eat during periods of access.

10    In making orders for custody, care and control, and access, the court’s focus is on the child’s welfare, which is the paramount consideration in all proceedings directly affecting the interests of a child: see s 3 of the GIA and s 125(2) of the Charter. …

11    It is common that a parent is granted sole care and control of a child while the other parent has access to the child. In appropriate cases, the court may grant both parents shared care and control if this is feasible and determined to best serve the child’s welfare. In such cases, the child may spend about three days of the week with a parent and the remaining four days with the other parent. Each parent will be responsible for day-to-day decision-making for the child when the child is living with him or her. The child will effectively have two homes and two primary caregivers in this arrangement … To be clear, shared care and control is different from joint custody; the former relates to the child living with both parents, while the latter is about joint decision-making over major decisions affecting the child.

12    ... in considering whether shared care and control would be in the child’s welfare, the court will have to consider factors such as that particular child’s needs at that stage of life, the extent to which the parents are able to co-operate within such an arrangement, and whether it is easy for that child, bearing in mind his or her age and personality, to live in two homes within one week. …

17    The court should also be concerned with whether both parents can support a two-home arrangement with sufficient co-operation so that there is minimal conflict over issues that ordinarily arise from daily living. …

20    There is thus neither any legal principle against shared care and control, nor a legal presumption that this arrangement is always in a child’s welfare. Where such an arrangement is suitable for a child in his or her developmental stage of life, considering his or her relationship with each parent and all relevant circumstances, such an order may be made for the child’s welfare. Whatever the arrangements ultimately made, parents must recognise that they must “place the needs of their children before their own”: …

84     I did not grant the Mother’s prayer for sole custody. It was obvious that the Mother wanted sole custody of the Child because she did not want to consult the Father on matters relating to the Child[^75] including important matters such as the application and renewal of passports and acceptance into schools. Her proposal for sole custody coupled with a relocation was an attempt to cut an involved and concerned Father out of the Child’s life. A joint custody order would send a message to send a message to the parties to co-operate with one another and remind the Mother that she should consult the Father on long-term and significant matters concerning the child’s welfare and upbringing. The acrimony between the parties was the result of the Mother interfering with the Father’s access and bonding with the Child and the Father’s reactions to the Mother’s interference. There were no exceptional circumstances to warrant the making of a sole custody or supervised access order.

85     In relation to care and control, I granted the parties shared care and control of the Child. The evidence was that the parties were able to co-operate on parenting the Child and that both parents played an active role in the care of the Child even after the parties separated in February 2018 until the stroller incident. After the stroller incident, the Mother started to take action, including the unilateral imposition of supervised access which interfered with Father bonding with the Child. This led to acrimony with the Father and the Father taking action which included asking the Mother to take over the lease of Marina apartment when he knew she could not afford to, asking the Mother to leave behind Child’s things, cutting off the Mother’s phone line, applying to vary the maintenance order and demanding the return of $50,000.

86     I ordered shared care and control based on the facts of the case. The Child effectively has 2 homes and 2 caregivers. The Father took care of the Child each weekday morning except for the 2 mornings when the Child had activities while the Mother took care of the Child in the afternoons and evenings. The Mother submitted that she has all along been the Child’s sole primary care-giver and that she has de facto care and control of the Child as the Father moved out of his own accord on 22 February 2018 leaving the Child behind with her.[^76] I accept the Father’s submission that the Mother only became the “primary caregiver” of the Child because she asked him to leave his apartment in February 2018 and deprived him of proper access to the Child through her conduct.[^77] The messages between the Mother and the Father on 21 February 2018[^78] showed that the Father left the Marina apartment after the Mother accused the Father of cheating on her, told him that she wanted “to separate ASAP” and that he should have the decency to leave the apartment. The Father responded by saying that he did not have the strength to put up with the Mother’s “heart breaking” abuse and accusations and left the apartment the next day with a request for the Mother to let him know the best times to come and spend time with the Child. The Father left the Marina apartment at the Mother’s request, not of his own accord. The order for shared care and control was made considering the best interests of the Child. The Child was cared for by both parents prior to the ending of the parents’ relationship. The evidence was that the parents were able to co-operate in the care of the Child after the Father left the Marina apartment. The Mother created a situation where she had de facto care and control of the Child by asking the Father to leave their shared residence and unilaterally imposing supervised access which interfered with the Father’s bonding with the Child. The order for shared care and control was made to send a message to the Mother that she has to co-parent with the Father and that it was inappropriate for her to have tried to cut off the Father who had been jointly caring for the Child from the Child’s life just because she wanted to end her relationship with the Father and to relocate.

87     Based on the Child’s schedule, I ordered that the Father was to have care and control on Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays from 9.30 a.m. to 2.30 p.m., on alternate Saturdays from 12.30 p.m. to Sundays 3.30 p.m. (taking into account the Child’s naptimes), alternate Sundays from 3.30 p.m. to Mondays 2.30 p.m. (taking into account the Mother’s Sunday schedule). The Father’s holidays are based on UK holidays. I ordered the Father to have public holiday time with the child on Christmas, New Year and Good Friday from 9.30 a.m. to 8 p.m. on alternate years and on Easter Monday, UK bank holidays and Boxing Day from 9.30 a.m. to 8 p.m. The Mother is to have public holiday time with the Child on all Singapore public holidays other than Christmas, New Year and Good Friday. Public holiday time with the Child will supersede the regular care and control time.

88     As for overseas travel with the child, I ordered the Father and Mother to be at liberty to bring the Child overseas for up to 2 weeks per trip and up to twice a year with the dates to be agreed between parties. The party intending to travel shall furnish the other party with the travel itinerary and relevant contact details at least 4 weeks before the commencement of the travel. Overseas travel with the child is to start after the child turns 2 years of age unless the parties consent to an earlier time. The Mother indicated she was appealing against the orders regarding the overseas time of the Father with the Child, the amount of time the Mother is allowed to travel overseas and the age of the Child to be allowed to travel. I am unsure what the Mother is specifically appealing against. The 2-week period for overseas time with the Child was part of the Mother’s proposal for the Father’s access to the Child. As for the age of the Child to travel, the Child has been travelling to far flung parts of the world since he was 3 months old.

## Decision on relocation

89     The welfare of the child is paramount when considering relocation applications. The relocating parent’s reasonable wish to relocate is an important factor affecting the child’s welfare but it was not relevant _per se_. This factor was relevant only to the extent that it was found that there would be a transference of the relocating parent’s insecurity and negative feelings onto the child. Even where the primary caregiver was able to establish that she reasonably wished to relocate in the best interests of the child, that was no more than a factor to be weighed in the overarching inquiry into the child’s welfare. There was no pre-fixed precedence or hierarchy among the many composite factors which might inform the court’s decision as to where the child’s best interests ultimately lay. Where these factors stood in relation to one another had to depend on a consideration of all the facts in each case. The child’s loss of relationship with the left-behind parent is another important factor in assessing the welfare of the child. It was axiomatic that a child benefited from the nurturing presence and joint contribution of both parents in his or her life. Relocation, however, represented a serious threat to this ideal state of joint parenting since the left-behind parent would become less of a presence in the child’s new life. How adversely the loss of that relationship would impact on the child’s welfare depended on the facts, in particular, the strength of the existing bond between the left-behind parent and the child. In general, the stronger the bond, the larger the resultant void in the child’s life if relocation were allowed, and, accordingly, the weightier this factor would be in the overall analysis. (See _BNS v BNT_ \[2015\] SGCA 23.)

90     In _BNS v BNT_, the Court of Appeal highlighted that with younger children, closeness is promoted by physical contact and frequent interaction in routine activities. Telephone and internet access are frequently unsatisfactory due to technical difficulties and generally permit conversation as the only type of interaction. Relocation was not allowed in _BNS v BNT_ for children who were 7 and 9 years of age.

91     For this case, it is not practical for the Father to have remote access to the Child if relocation was allowed. The Child is below 2 years of age and is unlikely to be able to hold a 30-minute conversation with the Father via Skype or Facetime as proposed by the Mother. On the other hand, the Mother could avail herself of technology to keep in touch with and receive support from her parents in Brazil. The time difference when communicating overseas would be more easily accommodated by the Mother compared to the Child.

92     While the Mother’s reasons for wanting to relocate are understandable and reasonable as she does not have any family in Singapore and she does not want to keep her life on hold now that her relationship with the Father has ended, she has not shown how the proposed relocation is in the best interest of the Child. The Mother has not provided a realistic access or parenting plan. She has not presented any concrete plans to attend college when she returns to Brazil. There is no mention of which colleges she will be making an application to.

93     If the Child is allowed to relocate to Brazil, there is a possibility that the Child will be left in the hands of neither parent.[^79] The Mother’s plan is live with her parents, to return to school or to work and to leave the Child under the care of her parents. Whether the Mother can live with her parents in the long term may be an issue. The Mother could not stay with her own parents without incident for a short while in January 2018, just 10 months prior to the hearing. She was asking the Father to make arrangements for her to leave Brazil earlier despite her doctor’s advice because of mistreatment from her mother. The Mother accused her own mother of abusing her physically and emotionally for 19 years and stated that her father constantly left the family to be with his friends and now has a “dead son and depressed daughter”. The fact that the Mother did not propose relocating to Brazil in her first affidavit is an indication that she was not seriously contemplating a relocation to Brazil. The Mother now proposes to put the Child in the care of her parents whom she says have abused and neglected her. It is unlikely that the Mother has resolved her deep seated issues with her parents between the filing of her first and second affidavits. While the Child is in Singapore, he is under the personal care of both his parents. The Mother’s proposal to relocate to Brazil in light of her own messages about her parents’ long term abuse and neglect does not engender confidence that the proposed relocation to Brazil is in the best interest of the Child. There are also safety concerns regarding the Mother’s hometown in light of the Mother’s admission that there are riots and violence issues which she is not able to control.

94     In considering whether to allow the Child to relocate to Brazil, I weighed the reasonable wishes of the Mother to relocate and considered whether the relocation will result in a loss of the Child’s relationship with the Father. The Mother’s concerns of being financially vulnerable and being of the mercy of the Father’s whims in terms of financial support are reasonable and understandable. The Father provides maintenance of $6,500 per month, has not defaulted in the payment of maintenance and has loaned the Mother $50,000 to start a business. However, the Father’s action of asking the Mother to take over the rent for the Marina apartment at $6,500 per month and the security deposit when he knew that she was not in a position to do so when he was upset with the Mother over access indirectly “forced” the Mother and Child out of the Marina apartment and caused undue distress for the Mother and the Child. The Father’s explanation for his actions was that he was very upset when the Mother filed OSG 84 as it meant that the Child will be taken away from him should the relocation prayer be granted. He was also upset that the Mother was hindering his unsupervised access and bonding with the Child and trying to make these proceedings as acrimonious as possible. He saw no reason to pay the extra $6,500 per month as rental for the Marina apartment for the Mother as he was already providing the Mother with $4,000 per month as maintenance.[^80] The Father’s actions were not in the best interests of the Child. The fact that Father cut off the Mother’s mobile phone line, applied to reduce maintenance and demanded for the return of the $50,000 meant for the starting of a business when he was upset with the Mother over access also exacerbated the problem.

95     The Father was an involved parent who took care of the Child prior to the parents’ separation. Even after the separation, the Father continued to see and take care of the Child. When the Mother started to impose supervised access, the Father continued to make an effort to maintain physical contact with the Child despite the difficulties. I accept that the Father’s submission that proposed relocation will destroy the relationship between the Father and the Child.[^81] Given the Child’s age, it would be important for the Father to meet the Child frequently and regularly and to maintain physical contact in order to build up a good relationship with the Child. Given that the Mother has been imposing supervised access on her terms in Singapore, it would be unrealistic to hope that she will give the Father liberal access even if the Father were to travel to Brazil. The Mother’s responses to conflict, such as “… we’ll be out of this country very soon so do whatever you want, I don’t care anymore”, raises questions whether the Mother will really cooperate with the Father if she relocates.

96     The Mother has stated that it takes 36 hours to travel between her hometown in Brazil and Singapore. For physical access to take place, the Father would have to take 3 days leave just for travelling (72 hours in total taking into account the time difference between Singapore and Brazil) before he will be able to get quality access to the Child. The Father is not commuting to Brazil for work or visiting Brazil regularly for any other purposes. The Father would have to take about 1 week’s leave to visit the Child. Given that the Father is working in Singapore and that the Child was less than 18 months old at the time of the hearing, it would not be feasible for either the Father or the Child to travel between Brazil and Singapore often for them to have regular physical contact with each other. The Mother’s proposal for the Child to travel by himself when he reaches the age of 7 is not practical. The Mother’s proposal for Skype access is also not feasible given the Child’s age. In view of the time difference between Singapore and the Brazil and the Father’s working hours, it would also be difficult for the Father to have remote access when he is not at work.

97     The Mother’s proposal to relocate to Brazil would mean that the Child may lose the ability to communicate with his own father. The Mother’s parents do not speak English. English does not appear to commonly spoken in the Mother’s hometown in Brazil in light of the difficulties the Father had when he visited the hometown. There is no documentary evidence with respect to the Mother’s proposal to send the Child to Maple Bear Vila Velha to learn English. The Mother has not exhibited any documents in relation to the location, reputation or curriculum of the school or any document confirming that the Child would be able to enrol in the school when he turns 4.

98     In any event, the Mother says the Child will be able to attend the school when he is 4. If relocation was allowed, this would mean that the Child would be in an environment where English is not taught or spoken for 2 ½ years before he goes to school to learn English. That would jeopardise the Child’s ability to speak to the Father in English. The Child will grow up speaking a different native language from the Father and the relationship will be even more strained because English will be a foreign or second language for the Child. It is likely that the Child will have no memory of his father, especially if the Mother has sole care and control and decides to cut the Father off from the Child’s life.[^82]

99     While I understand the Plaintiff’s reasonable wishes to relocate, I find that the potential loss of the Child’s relationship with the Father in the case to be very real. There is a possibility that the Child may even lose the ability to communicate with his father. The opportunities for the Father to meet the Child physically are limited given the distance between Singapore and Brazil and that fact that the Father has no other reason such as work to go to Brazil. In the circumstances, I refused the Mother’s application to relocate with the Child.

100    Part of the reasons given by the Mother for relocation is the Mother being unable to work and being financially vulnerable. There is no evidence from the Mother as to whether she has sought to gain employment in Singapore by applying for the relevant passes. There is no written evidence that she cannot get rental based on a long term visit pass. There is no evidence from the relevant authorities that she cannot obtain rental accommodation based on a long term visit pass.

101    Although he has no legal obligation to maintain the Mother, the Father may have to consider further assisting the Mother with matters such as applying to extend her Long Term Visit Pass, obtaining accommodation or starting a business if she requires assistance if the Father wants the Child to continue to stay in Singapore. The issue of relocation may be reconsidered if there are material changes in circumstances such as the Mother not being able to continue to live in Singapore or if the Child is older and has no issues communicating with the Father.

102    It is obvious that both parents love the Child very much and are concerned that the other parent will remove the Child from their lives. Orders were made for both parents not to remove the Child from Singapore without the other parents’ consent or without an order of court and in relation to the Child’s passports. I referred parties to for counselling to work out the orders on custody, care and control. I also heard costs arguments and made costs orders at a separate hearing. I urge both parties to act in the best interest of the Child as they continue in their journey co-parenting the Child.
