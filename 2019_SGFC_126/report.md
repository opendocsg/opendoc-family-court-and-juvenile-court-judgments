Family Law – Ancillary Matters – section 112 & 113 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353)

14 November 2019

### District Judge Cheryl Koh:

## A.    Introduction

1       These are the ancillary matters arising out of a divorce involving two issues: the division of matrimonial assets and maintenance for the defendant wife (the “**Wife**”).

2       In this case, the matrimonial flat is in the name of three persons, namely, the plaintiff husband (the “**Husband**”), the Wife and the eldest son (the “**Son**”). All three persons have paid towards the matrimonial flat using their CPF monies. Whilst the Husband disputes the Son’s interest in the matrimonial flat, he has refused to make any application in the High Court to determine the Son’s interest, despite directions at earlier Case Conferences.

3       On 14 and 21 August 2019, I noted that both counsel agreed at the ancillary matters hearing that the Son’s CPF contributions are towards 45% of the matrimonial flat. I determined that of the balance 55%, each party is entitled to 50% of the same. I further recorded that parties are at liberty to apply for consequential orders, if parties and the Son are unable to agree on the transfer or the sale of the matrimonial flat.

4       The Husband has appealed against the part of my decision determining that parties are entitled to their 55% interest in the matrimonial flat in equal proportions.

## B.    Background facts

5       Parties were married on 31 October 1980. The Husband commenced divorce proceedings on 04 April 2017. Interim Judgment was granted on 03 October 2018. The marriage therefore lasted 38 years.

6       There are three (3) male adult children to the marriage, aged 38, 28 and 27 years old. The children are gainfully employed. The eldest and the youngest children live with the Wife in the matrimonial flat. The second child lives with an uncle. The Husband lives alone in a rented room.

7       The Husband is 59 years old and works as a TV operator. The Wife is 58 years old. She was a housewife throughout most of the marriage, although the Husband claims that she is now working.

8       Under an order made on 9 July 2013 in MSS No. 1999 of 2013, the Husband is to pay the Wife interim maintenance of $800.00 per month. By way of a consent order made on 16 January 2019 in MSS No. 209 of 2019, maintenance was reduced to $400.00 per month.

9       The affidavits and submissions filed by the parties are as follows:

> (a)     the Husband’s 1st Affidavit of Assets and Means (“**AOM**”) filed on 24 May 2019;

> (b)     the Wife’s 1st AOM filed on 21 May 2019;

> (c)     affidavit of parties’ son, XXX (the “**Son**”), filed on 21 May 2019;

> (d)     the Husband’s 2nd AOM filed on 24 June 2019;

> (e)     the Wife’s 2nd AOM filed on 17 June 2019;

> (f)     the Husband’s Submissions filed on 13 August 2019; and

> (g)     the Wife’s Submissions filed on 01 August 2019.

## C.    Grounds of Decision

### The law

#### UDA v UDB and UDC <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGCA 20</span>

10     A first consideration arises as to whether the Court may make any orders directly affecting the matrimonial flat, as it is not only in the names of the Husband and the Wife, but also in the name of a third party, the Son. In this regard, the Court of Appeal in _UDA v UDB and another_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGCA 20</span> (“**_UDA_**”) upheld at \[19\] the principle that the Family Court could not make orders directly impacting the property rights of a third party. Instead, the Family Court could consider the three options set out by the then Honourable Judicial Commissioner Debbie Ong in _UDA v UDB and another_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHCF 16</span>, as follows:

> (a)      Option 1(a): the court, exercising its powers under section 112 of the Women’s Charter, hears the evidence of the third party and the divorcing parties in order to determine whether the disputed asset is a matrimonial asset. It can do this either on affidavit evidence only or by permitting cross-examination. If the court concludes that one or both of the divorcing parties has/have a beneficial interest in the property, it may include the asset in the matrimonial pool but not make any order directly affecting that asset;

> (b)      Option 1(b): the same as Option 1(a), save that the court further provides in its order that, should there subsequently be a civil action determining the beneficial interest of any of the disputed assets, its order should be modified in the manner specified to take into account the final outcome of the civil action;

> (c)      Option 2: the court stays the proceedings under section 112 of the Women’s Charter in order to allow the property dispute to be separately determined first. This option needed no further discussion as being part of the court’s case management powers; and

> (d)      Option 3: the court simply determines the property interests in the asset in section 112 of the Women’s Charter proceedings and makes orders affecting that property – for example, a sale or transfer of the property.

11     In the present case, the Husband disputes the Son’s interest in the matrimonial flat, but refuses to make any application in the High Court to determine the Son’s interest, despite directions at earlier Case Conferences. Both counsel have not addressed in their submissions which of the three options set out in _UDA_ they are asking for. They however accept that the Family Court is not able to make any orders directly affecting the matrimonial flat since it is also in the name of the Son. As such, I will only determine the division of matrimonial assets between the Husband and the Wife, subject to the Son’s interest in the matrimonial flat. This is essentially Option 1(a) referred to in _UDA_.

#### To apply the structured approach or long single income approach

12     A further consideration arises to whether the Court should apply the structured approach espoused in the Court of Appeal decision of _ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span> (“**_ANJ_**”), or the single income approach for long marriages set out in the Court of Appeal decision of _TNL v TNK_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 15</span> (“**_TNL_**”). Both counsel have not addressed in their submissions which of the two approaches the Court should adopt; the Wife simply argues that she should be awarded a higher proportion of the matrimonial flat in view of the long marriage and in lieu of lump sum maintenance[^1], whilst the Husband argued that he should be awarded 80% of the matrimonial pool[^2].

13     This is a long marriage of 39 years with three (3) adult children. The Wife was a housewife throughout most of the marriage, but the Husband alleges that she has been working for the past few years as there are contributions into her CPF account from May 2016 to July 2018 and October 2018 to April 2019. The Wife claims that these were false declarations made by her friend for her company to qualify for foreign labour entitlement. In my view, whether the structured approach in _ANJ_ or the single income approach in _TNL_ is applied, a similar outcome results where parties would be entitled to about an equal share of their interest in the matrimonial flat, as discussed below.

### Value of the matrimonial pool

14     Parties largely do not dispute the value of the matrimonial pool. I find the same to to around $488,844.23 (subject to the Son’s interest in the matrimonial flat), computed as follows:

### Direct contributions to the matrimonial flat

15     Both counsel agreed at the hearing that the Son made direct contributions in CPF funds towards 45% of the matrimonial flat, whilst the parties made direct contributions in CPF funds towards the balance 55%. There are no cash contributions. As between parties’ 55% share, both counsel also agreed that parties’ direct contributions in CPF funds are in the ratio of 87:13 in favour of the Husband, computed as follows:

### Direct contributions to the matrimonial pool

16     This meant that parties’ direct contributions towards the matrimonial pool is in the ratio of 84:16 in favour of the Husband, computed as follows:

### Indirect contributions

17     The Husband argued that indirect contributions ought to be 70:30 in his favour. After marriage, the Wife did not work. He was the sole breadwinner for at least 20 years and paid for all expenses and outgoings. He also did the marketing and helped with the household and the children. He further brought the family for holidays. The Wife argued that indirect contributions ought to be in her favour. She took care of the household and raised three children.

18     I found indirect contributions to be 60:40 in the Wife’s favour. According to the Husband, he was the sole breadwinner but only for about 20 years. Thereafter, the Son contributed to the family expenses (including payment towards the matrimonial flat) when he started working in 2002. The Son gave evidence that the Husband was often drunk, irresponsible, bad tempered and violent[^3]. The Wife took care of the household and raised three children into adulthood, who are now 38, 28 and 27 years old and gainfully employed.

### Applying ANJ: final ratio of parties’ entitlement to the matrimonial pool

19     Assuming the Husband’s position that the Wife has been working for the past few years is accepted and this is therefore not a long single income marriage, the structured approach in _ANJ_ is applied. Applying _ANJ_, I found that parties are entitled to the matrimonial pool in the ratio of 62:38 in favour of the Husband:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="34.76%"> <col width="32.62%"> <col width="32.62%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><u>The Husband</u></b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><u>The Wife</u></b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Direct contributions</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">84 (50% weightage)</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">16 (50% weightage)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Indirect contributions</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">40 (50% weightage)</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">60 (50% weightage)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Overall ratio</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">62</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">38</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

20     I do not see any particular circumstance in this case to adjust the final ratio.

### Applying ANJ: parties’ entitlement to the matrimonial flat

21     This meant that the Husband is entitled to 56% of the matrimonial flat, whilst the Wife is entitled to 44% of the matrimonial flat, computed as follows:-

### Lump sum maintenance

22     The Husband argued that there should be no maintenance for the Wife as she could maintain herself. He alleges that the Wife is now working, as there are contributions made to her CPF account from May 2016 to July 2018 and October 2018 to April 2019. The Wife claims that these were false declarations made by her friend for her company to qualify for foreign labour entitlement. She sought a lump sum maintenance based on the current interim maintenance order for $400.00 per month.

23     I decided to award the Wife a lump sum maintenance of $12,000.00 ($400.00 x 2½ years/30 months). Even if the Wife is now working, parties agreed to the consent order for reduced monthly maintenance of $400.00 in January 2019 when CPF contributions were already declared in the Wife’s account. The Wife has also been reliant on the Husband as the main breadwinner in this long marriage of 39 years with 3 adult children. The Wife’s expenses amount to at least $500.00 per month (including food and groceries, transport, and her share of utilities and telephone/internet/mobile phone charges[^4]). As such, a lump sum of a further two and a half years’ of maintenance would be just. Applying the lump sum maintenance, this will bring the Wife’s share of parties’ 55% interest in the matrimonial flat to about 50% (96,555.16 + 12,000.00//220,000.00).

### Applying the single income approach in TNL as an alternative

24     Alternatively, if the marriage is treated as a long single income marriage (as the Wife’s CPF contributions were only for the past 3 years out of 39 years) and the approach in _TNL_ is applied, the Wife would be entitled to about 50% of the matrimonial pool of $308,844.23. This translates to $154,422.12, which meant the Wife should receive an additional sum of $133,616.48 ($154,422.12 less her sole assets of $20,805.64). This sum represents 60% ($133,616.48 /$220,000.00) of parties’ 55% interest in the matrimonial flat. Applying the approach in _TNL_ instead of that in _ANJ_ therefore meant that the Wife would receive a slightly higher share ($133,616.48 or 60%, instead of $117,360.80 or 50%) of parties’ interest in the matrimonial flat (without considering lump sum maintenance). There would therefore even be less basis for the Husband’s appeal, if _TNL_ is applied.

## D.    Conclusion

25     In these circumstances, bearing in mind that this is a long marriage of almost 40 years with 3 adult children, and that parties do not have any significant matrimonial asset other than the matrimonial flat, it would be just and equitable for parties to be entitled to an equal share in their interest in the same.

26     The Court is not able to make orders directly affecting the matrimonial flat as it is also in the name of a third party, the Son. I note that parties agree that the Son’s interest in the matrimonial flat is at 45%, and the Court has determined that of the balance 55%, each party is entitled to half of the same. Parties are at liberty to apply for consequential orders if parties and the Son are unable to agree on the sale or transfer of the matrimonial flat.
