Ancillary Orders – Division of Matrimonial Assets – Spousal Maintenance

7 April 2021

### District Judge Goh Zhuo Neng:

## A.   INTRODUCTION

1       The parties were married for 25 years, with one child above the age of 21. On 31 December 2020, I heard and determined the ancillary matters, making the following orders:

> a)     That the matrimonial home be sold in the open market within 9 months of the final judgement. Parties will have joint conduct of the sale. The sales proceeds will be split 52.7 : 47.3 in favour of the Defendant after repaying the costs and expenses of sale. The Defendant will refund amounts withdrawn from his Central Depository Fund (including accrued interest) from his share of the proceeds.

> b)     There will be no maintenance for the Plaintiff.

> c)     Liberty to Apply.

2       On 11 January 2021, the Defendant filed a Notice of Appeal against my decision. I set out below the full grounds of my decision.

## B.   ASSETS IN DISPUTE

3       Parties were agreed on the valuation and inclusion of the following assets set out at **Annex A.** The only assets in dispute were two properties located in Indonesia, which they referred to as “**Swallow House**” and “**Indonesia House**”.

## I.   Swallow House

4       Swallow House is a property located in Indonesia that is being used to rear swallows. The nests of the swallows are sold as “bird’s nest”. Swallow House comprises of a building with a built up area of 196 sqm, sitting on a 765sqm plot of land. It was fully paid for by the Defendant.

5       Parties agreed that the Swallow House should be included as part of the matrimonial assets. They disagreed on its valuation, with the Plaintiff valuing it at $50,000.00 and the Defendant valuing it at $79,000.00.

6       Only the Defendant had engaged a professional valuer to substantiate his valuation of Swallow House (“**Valuation Report**”). The Plaintiff had based her valuation of the property on the estimated value of the sales proceeds of the “birds nest” produced by Swallow House. However, it was not substantiated by a professional’s report and it was not based on the value of the land.

7       The Valuation Report valued the land and building on Swallow House at IDR 429,170,000 and IDR 470,060,000 respectively, for a total of IDR899,230,000. This converts to about $89,923.00 at a rate of IDR10,000 to SGD 1. It is not clear why the Defendant eventually settled for a valuation of $79,000.00 in his submissions to the Court.

8       The Valuation Report suffered from certain shortcomings:

> a)     Property Comparison Data – Reference was made to offered prices that had been offered for 3 different plots of land. However, there was no documentary proof of these offers. The plots of land also varied in size and bore little similarity to Swallow House.

>> i)       Property A – Land area of 1800 sqm. No building. Valued at IDR810,000,000.

>> ii)       Property B – Land area of 600 sqm. Building with an built up area of 1,000 sqm. Valued at IDR 1,200,000,000.

>> iii)       Property C – Land area of 800 sqm. Building with a built up area of 600 sqm. Valued at IDR3,500,000,000.

> b)     Conclusion of the Land Value and Building Value – There is no analysis of how the Valuation Report arrived at its valuation of the land (IDR 429,170,000) and building (IDR 470,060,000) that comprise Swallow House. The valuations were pronounced as bare statements without any form of detailed explanation. Some cursory references were made to how the valuations were based on appraisal methods, but it was not clear how these methods were applied to determine the values referred to.

9       Given the lack of sufficient evidence, I applied a 25% discount to the Defendant’s valuation of $79,000.00. This valued the Swallow House at $59,250.00, which is slightly higher than the Plaintiff’s valuation of $50,000.00.

## II.   Indonesia House

10     Indonesia House was purchased in 1998 for about $18,000.00. This included the costs of renovation. The Defendant paid for everything. The property was sold by the Plaintiff in September 2017 for about $16,000.00.

11     The Defendant submitted that Indonesia House should be added back into the matrimonial pool with a value of about $50,000.00. He believed that it had been sold at an undervalue as it was sold to the Plaintiff’s relative, a Ms ‘C’. Tax documents provided by the Defendant show that the current owner of Indonesia House is a Ms ‘C’, which matches the name of the payor set out in a receipt for IDR160,000,000 to the Plaintiff (about $16,000.00 at a rate of IDR10,000 to SGD 1).

12     The Plaintiff explained that the property had to be sold at a lower rate as it was dilapidated. This was verified by the pictures provided by the Plaintiff. The Defendant did not prepare a professional valuation of the property, but submitted the asking prices for neighbouring units which ranged from IDR 560,000,000 to IDR 860,000,000.

13     The Plaintiff also explained that she had to sell the property to cover her own expenses as the Defendant was not providing her with sufficient maintenance. The proceeds of Indonesia House were collected in cash and not placed in a bank account. The Plaintiff’s bank statements show that she received monies of $550.00 on 2 October 2017, $1,000.00 on 28 October 2017, $1,050 on 27 November 2017 and $15,500.00 on 13 November 2017. I took the view that the bulk of these monies represented the proceeds of sale from Indonesia House.

14     I took the view that Indonesia House was sold at a fair price, considering its condition. The transaction had been completed and the Mother received the proceeds in her account. I took the view that the proceeds should not be returned to the matrimonial pool, as:

> a)     The Plaintiff was entitled to use the proceeds for her expenses, as she did not work and it was likely that the Defendant did not provide her with maintenance in 2018. I note that the Defendant was unable to provide proof that he had paid her maintenance in 2018, resulting in an application for interim maintenance being filed by the Plaintiff. It was only in December 2018 that an order was made for the Defendant to pay interim maintenance to the Plaintiff.

> b)     The sale also preceded the filing of the writ of divorce on 30 May 2019 (about 1.5 years), so it was not a case of dissipation to avoid the inclusion of assets in the pool of matrimonial assets.

## III.   Conclusion

15     As explained, I excluded Indonesia House from the pool of matrimonial assets. Swallow House was included at a value of $59,250.00. This brought the value of the pool of matrimonial assets to $461,787.69. The full list of assets and their values are set out at **Annex B**.

## C.   DIVISION OF MATRIMONIAL ASSETS

16     Both parties agreed that as this concerned a long single income marriage, the matrimonial assets should be divided equally. It was submitted by the Defendant that the matrimonial flat should be sold and divided equally, and that the remaining assets should be divided equally. However the Defendant’s counsel admitted that he had no compelling reason for taking a bifurcated approach to division as there was nothing unique about the circumstances here.

17     Dividing the valued assets of $461,787.69 equally would give the Plaintiff $230,893.84 and Defendant $230,893.85. In summary, both parties would retain all assets in their own names. The matrimonial property would be sold and the net proceeds after repayment of costs and expenses of the sale would be divided 47.3: 52.7 in favour of the Defendant. The Defendant would also refund amounts withdrawn from his Central Depository Fund (including accrued interest) from his share of the proceeds.

18     The apportionment of assets is set out in the table below.

19     As there were no strong reasons cited why the parties would not be able to cooperate in the sale of the matrimonial home, I also ordered that both parties would have joint conduct of the sale and gave liberty to apply.

## D.   SPOUSAL MAINTENANCE

20     The Plaintiff was seeking maintenance of $1,400.00 from the Defendant. As stated in _ATE v ATD_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGCA 2</span>, \[26\],

> _“As the power to order maintenance is supplementary to the power to order division of matrimonial assets, courts regularly take into account each party’s share of the matrimonial assets when assessing the appropriate quantum of maintenance to be ordered.”_

21     As the Plaintiff was due to receive a substantial portion of the matrimonial assets, with most of it in cash, I decided that there would be no further obligation for the Defendant to pay maintenance to the Plaintiff.

## E.   CONCLUSION AND COSTS

22     For the reasons set out above, I made the above orders. Both parties submitted that there be no order as to costs and I agreed.
