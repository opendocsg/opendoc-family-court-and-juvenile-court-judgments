Setting Aside and Variation of Ancillary Orders

8 July 2019

### District Judge Goh Zhuo Neng:

## A.   Introduction

1       The present application by the Defendant Father (“**Father**”) in SUM1831 of 2018 (“**Application**”) involved the setting aside and variation of ancillary orders made in D2967 of 2012. These orders were set aside on the basis that in the course of the ancillary proceedings, the Plaintiff Mother (“**Mother**”) had failed to disclose substantial amounts in her Citigold bank accounts.

2       The ancillary orders which were the subject of this Application relate solely to the division of matrimonial property, maintenance for the Mother and maintenance for the Children. The current relevant orders in effect at the time of the Application are set out at **Annex A.** On 25 March 2019, I heard the Application and made the orders set out at **Annex B.**

3       In summary:

a)     Under the original orders, the Father was directed to transfer his share of the matrimonial property to the Mother who would make a lump sum payment to him ($97,534.00) He was also required to pay her a lump sum payment of maintenance for herself ($7,200). Other than that, parties were to retain all assets in their own names. The Father was also required to provide maintenance to their only child (the “**Child**”).

b)     Under my orders in this application, I allowed the Mother to retain the matrimonial property. The Father would also keep the lump sum received by him from the Mother, and in addition to that lump sum, the Mother would have to pay him a further amount in full settlement of the division of matrimonial property ($73,447.73). The Mother would no longer be entitled to maintenance for herself and would refund the spousal maintenance paid by the Father to date ($3,200.00). I did not disturb the current orders on Child maintenance.

4       On 8 April 2019, the Mother filed her appeal against all of my orders. The full grounds of my decision are set out below.

## B.   BACKGROUND AND ANCILLARIES

5       Parties were married on xx xxx 2003. The writ for divorce was filed on 18 June 2012 and the interim judgement was granted on 5 June 2013, making this a marriage of almost 10 years. The Child was born on xx xxx 2008.

6       The ancillary orders were made on 18 March 2014 in a contested hearing by the Family Court. The Grounds of Decision of the Family Court are published as _UGK v UGL_ \[2014\] 184. The Mother later filed an appeal against these orders, and on appeal the High Court made some adjustments to the ancillary orders on 17 November 2014.

## C.   THE DISCOVERY OF THE CITIGOLD ACCOUNTS

7       After the ancillary orders were made, various applications were filed by the parties to vary them. The relevant applications here are SUM xx46 of 2016 and SUM xx68 of 2016 filed respectively by the Mother and Father for the variation of care and control and maintenance for the Child of the family. I heard both applications on 3 July 2017 and increased the maintenance of the Child from $800.00 to $900.00 and dismissed the rest of the prayers.

8       In the course of hearing the above summonses, the Mother filed an affidavit dated 15 February 2017 disclosing that she had $333,811.94 held in bank accounts with Citibank (“**Citigold Accounts**”). These accounts had existed at the time the time of the proceedings before the Family Court for the ancillary matters in 2014. However, they were not disclosed to the Father, or the Family Court.

9       On 25 May 2018, the Father filed the Application, seeking to set aside the ancillary orders made on 18 March 2014. This was on the basis that the monies in the Citigold Accounts were not disclosed during the ancillary matters.

10.    At a case conference on 13 July 2018, both parties confirmed that they were agreeable for the ancillary matters orders relating to the division of matrimonial property, and maintenance for the Child and Mother to be set aside and for the Mother to pay the Father costs of $600.00 and disbursements of $224.60 which represented costs incurred up to that juncture.

11     I then directed for these orders to be set aside and for parties to file further affidavits in respect of the Citigold Accounts, and any subsequent payments made by the parties post the making of the ancillary orders on 14 March 2019. These facts would then be taken into account as a rehearing of the ancillary orders on the division of matrimonial property and maintenance.

## C.   THE LAW

12     Under Section 112(4) of the Women’s Charter (Cap.353)(the “**Act**”), the court has the power to vary revoke or discharge any order made in the division of matrimonial assets. I am aware that in the Court of Appeal decision of _AYM v AYL_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 1 SLR 924</span> (“**AYM**”) and _BMI v BMJ_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 43</span> (“**BMI**”), it has been stated that the court does not have the power to revisit or re-open an order of court with respect to the division of matrimonial assets that has been completely implemented, except in the limited case of fraud.

13     In the present case, the ancillary orders had provided for parties to retain assets in their own names, save that the Father would transfer his share of the matrimonial flat to the Mother in return for the sum of $97,534.00. This amount had been paid by the Mother on 23 April 2015 and the transfer of the Father’s share in the matrimonial flat had been completed since.

14     While the transfer of the matrimonial flat had been effected, it was still within my power to set aside that transaction and re-hear the ancillaries as the parties had consented to my doing so, applying the principles in the case of _ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span> - which had not been decided at the time of the ancillary matters:

a)     Step 1 - Express as a ratio the parties’ direct contributions relative to each other, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets;

b)     Step 2 - Express as a second ratio the parties’ indirect contributions relative to each other, having regard to both financial and non-financial contributions; and

c)     Step 3 - Derive the parties’ overall contributions relative to each other by taking an average of the two ratios above (the derived ratio shall be referred to as “the average ratio”).

15     In applying the Structured Approach and determining the issues of Child and spousal maintenance, I decided that I would:

a)     Assume the addition of the Citigold Accounts to matrimonial pool.

b)     Adopt the factual findings of the Family Court for the hearing of the ancillary matters as set out in _UGK v UGL_ \[2014\] 184, in respect of the parties’ expenses, the children’s expenses, and the valuations of the other assets in the matrimonial pool.

c)     Adopt the factual findings of the Family Court for the hearing of the ancillary matters as set out in _UGK v UGL_ \[2014\] 184, which would be relevant to determining the parties’ indirect contributions.

16     This was because the basis for setting aside the ancillary orders under the current Application was the failure of the Mother to disclose the Citigold Accounts to the pool of matrimonial assets. It would not be appropriate for me to re-hear factual issues that had already been determined by the Family Court unless they had been affected by the addition of the Citigold Accounts to the matrimonial pool of assets.

17     On the issue of Spousal maintenance, section 118 of the Act provides that the Court may at any time vary or rescind any order for maintenance where it is satisfied that the order was based on any misrepresentation or mistake of fact or where there had been any material change of circumstances.

18     On the issue of Child maintenance, section 72 of the Act read with section 127(2) of the Act provide that the Court may vary or rescind maintenance for a child where there is a change in circumstances of the child or his parents, or for other good cause.

## D.   PRELIMINARY ISSUE OF EVIDENCE

19     At this juncture, I would add that at the conclusion of the hearing on 25 March 2019 and before I stood down to deliberate before giving my decision, the Mother’s counsel sought to adduce further evidence in the form of an individual search profile of the Father, which set out the companies that the Father had involvement in. It was submitted to me that the Father had hidden his shares in several companies during the marriage.

20     The individual search profile was not tendered as an affidavit, and therefore I did not admit this document as evidence in the proceedings.

a)     First, to do so would have been prejudicial to the Father, who would not have had any opportunity to respond to these documents.

b)     Second, since the first case conference of the matter on 13 June 2018 (9 months prior to the hearing!), the Mother had more than enough time to instruct her lawyers to submit these documents and should not be allowed to surprise the Father at this juncture.

c)     Third, the allegations of non-disclosure in respect of the Father’s shareholding in companies had already been brought and considered by the Family Court at the hearing of the ancillary matters on 14 March 2014, resulting in the sum of $33,682.55 being added to the pool of matrimonial assets, which I accepted (see \[21\] to \[23\] of _UGK v UGL_ \[2014\] 184).

In summary, this was simply the Mother’s attempt to resurrect issues that she had the opportunity to ventilate some 5 years ago, and which had already been determined.

## E.   APPLICATION OF THE STRUCTURED APPROACH

#### I.    Direct Contributions – Assets in Parties’ Names and Joint Names

21     At the start of the hearing, parties confirmed that the parties held the following amount of assets in their own names:

a)     Father - $125,713.69

b)     Mother $450,783.96 (inclusive of the monies in the Citigold Accounts, which amounted to about $330,221.46 as of 1 February 2013)

22     They also agreed that the net value of the matrimonial flat (the “**Property**”) and their direct contributions to and deriving from it were as follows.

#### II.    Direct Contributions – Citigold Accounts

23     The parties did not disagree on whether the Citigold Account should be included in the matrimonial pool of assets. However, they disagreed as to whether the full amount of the monies in the Citigold Accounts should be included in the matrimonial pool of assets. The Father argued that the balance of $330,221.46 as of 1 February 2013 should be added to the matrimonial pool, while the Mother argued that only $200,000.00 should be added to the matrimonial pool as the Mother had saved up to $100,000.00 prior to the marriage.

24     Here, there were two factors to consider:

a)     The Mother was not able to produce any bank statements circa 2003 when she was married. Thus it was impossible to verify the balance of the Citigold Accounts prior to the marriage.

b)     The Mother had been working for nearly 10 years prior to the marriage, and continued working 5 years into the marriage. It was quite likely that not all the monies in the Citigold Accounts as of February 2013 were earned or accumulated during the marriage.

25     Taking the above factors into account, I adopted a broad brush approach and took the average of the two figures proposed by the parties - $265,110.73 – as the value of the Citigold Accounts.

#### III.    Direct Contributions – Total Contributions

26     Taking into account the assets in joint and sole names of the parties, the total value of the matrimonial pool was $824,228.94. I made the finding that the Mother had contributed $560,145.22 (68%) and the Father $264,083.72 (32%) and pro-rated their direct contributions accordingly as a percentage of the matrimonial pool. The breakdown of these contributions is set out at **Annex C**.

#### IV.    Indirect Contributions

27     For indirect contributions, the Family Court had made the following findings in _UGK v UGL_ \[2014\] 184. :

a)     In the first 5 years of the marriage, and prior to the birth of the Child in 2008, both parties worked. During this period, both parties contributed to the expenses of the household.

b)     During the last 5 years of the marriage, when the Child was born, the Mother had been the primary caregiver of the Child for the last 5 years of the marriage. During this period the Father would either be frequently in Malaysia or at his mother’s flat and would bear almost all the family expenses.

28     The Mother’s counsel submitted that the indirect contribution should be 60:40 in her favour. The Father’s counsel submitted that it would be fair to give the Mother a 55-60% share of indirect contributions. I agreed with the Mother as this was a figure that accurately represented the contributions of the Mother where she had been a caregiver for a relatively short period – about half the marriage and about 5 years.

#### V.    Structured Approach - Division

29     Applying the Structured Approach, I derived the average of the parties’ direct and indirect contributions, and also their share of the matrimonial assets.

30     In dividing the matrimonial assets, I decided that the Father would be entitled to the following assets:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="49.98%"> <col width="50.02%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Description</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Amount</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Assets in Father’s Name</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$125,713.69</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Amount received for Flat to date</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$97,534.00</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Cash Transfer for division of property to be paid to the Father by 8 April 2019.</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$73,474.73</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Total</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$296,722.42</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

31     This in my view would be just and equitable as it recognised that the Mother could retain the matrimonial flat where she resided with the Child and ensure that the Child’s accommodation would not be affected. It also recognised that the Mother possessed a fairly considerable amount of monies in the Citigold Accounts and would not have difficulty settling the payment of $73,474.73 which I ordered to be paid to the Father by 8 April 2019.

## F.   MAINTENANCE FOR THE MOTHER AND CHILD

32     I took the view that maintenance for the Child would remain unchanged. There was no change in circumstance that justified the variation or rescission of the maintenance for the Child. The non-disclosure of the Citigold Accounts did not have a significant bearing on the Mother’s earning capacity and would not have made a difference to the making of maintenance orders for the Child. Furthermore, the issue of the Child’s maintenance had already been determined in SUM xx46 of 2016 and SUM xx68 of 2016, taking into account the non-disclosure of the Citigold Accounts.

33     However, I took the view that the existence of the Citigold Accounts would affect the determination of the Mother’s maintenance. Both the High Court and the Family Court had taken the view that the Mother should return to the workforce and had ordered a sum of maintenance to be paid to her while she searched for a job.

34     These decisions were based on the assumption that the Mother did not have significant cash assets. This was understandable, as at the time the Family Court determined the issue of maintenance, the Mother’s liquid assets (apart from CPF accounts) were $700.00 in a DBS bank account, and 130 Singtel shares valued at $458.90.

35     By failing to disclose the existence of the Citigold Accounts, the Mother had clearly misrepresented her net worth to the Court. On this point, the Mother claimed that the monies were being held on trust by her for her family members, who had lent her money and allowed her to keep the money in her named accounts. I did not believe that the Mother owed any debts to her family for the following reasons:

a)     The Mother had continued to retain a considerable amount of monies in the Citigold Accounts throughout the marriage. If her debts to her relatives were so significant and she had the monies to repay them, why not do so?

b)     There was no documentary proof tendered by the Mother to show the transfer of monies from her relatives to her in respect of the alleged loans.

36     The existence of the Citigold Accounts meant that there was no question of whether the Mother would be in need of maintenance pending her search for a new job. Even after the payments to the Father of $97,534.00 and $73,474.73 (total of $170,008.73) were accounted for, that would leave her with about $159,212.73 of the $330,221.46 in the Citigold Accounts, which would be more than sufficient to cover her expenses while she searched for a new job. Moreover, she would continue to be able to live in the Property which had also been transferred to her in full, and not need to have to incur rental expenses.

37     Therefore, I made the finding that the Mother would not be entitled to maintenance, and that the Mother would repay the Father the sum of $3,200.00 which had been paid by him as maintenance. This would be paid by her to the Father by 8 April 2019, together with the payment of $73,474.73 in respect of the division of matrimonial property.

## G. CONCLUSION AND COSTS

38     In the circumstances, I made the above orders. It was submitted to me by the Mother that there should be no further order as to costs as I had earlier ordered at the Case Conference on 31 July 2018 costs of $600.00 and disbursements of $224.60.

39     I clarified to the parties that costs should follow the event, especially since the application had been necessitated by the Mother’s non-disclosure of the Citibank Accounts. I ordered the Mother to pay the Father further amount of costs of $2,500.00 (all in), representing the costs of the hearing and affidavits filed to date. This made it a total amount of $3,100.00 in costs and $224.60 in disbursements payable by the Mother to the Father.
