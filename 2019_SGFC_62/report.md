Family Law – Enforcement of maintenance – s.71 Women’s Charter

8 July 2019

### District Judge Suzanne Chin:

## Introduction

1       This matter involved cross applications brought by the parties who are now divorced. The applications revolved around maintenance for their 2 children. The parties had entered into a consent order on 5 April 2017 which required the Father to pay, inter alia, for the children’s school fees at an international school in Singapore (“Consent Order”).

2       On 14 June 2018, the Mother filed an application for the enforcement of arrears of children’s maintenance and 19 July 2018, the Father filed an application requesting for a variation of the Consent Order, specifically requesting that the amount of school fees be capped at S$500 per month for both children and for this variation to be backdated to July 2018.

3       After hearing from the parties, I dismissed the Father’s application relating to the variation of maintenance and made orders to enforce the outstanding arrears of maintenance. The Father has filed an appeal only in respect of my orders relating to the enforcement of arrears and I now set forth below the reasons for my decision on this application.

## Background Facts

4       The parties were married on 2 June 2004 at the Registry of Muslim Marriages and they have 2 sons of ages 14 and 10. On 28 March 2007, parties went through their 1st divorce but on 13 April 2007, they reconciled and obtained a revocation of divorce at the Registry of Muslim Marriages. Unfortunately, by 2011, cracks appeared in the marriage again and eventually the Father filed commenced divorce proceeding at the Syariah Court once again on 2 March 2015.

5       While the divorce proceedings at the Syariah Court were ongoing, the Mother took out an application in the Family Justice Court for maintenance for herself and the 2 children of the marriage. At mediation, parties were able to reach agreement and the first consent order was recorded.

6       On 8 December 2015, parties were officially divorced at the Syariah Court and care and control of the 2 sons was granted to the Mother. Sometime in 2016, the Mother filed an application for the enforcement of arrears of maintenance referred to in the past court order while the Father filed an application for a downward variation of maintenance as recorded in the past court order. At the trial, parties were able to negotiate a settlement and the Consent Order was recorded on 5 April 2017.

## Evidence tendered by the parties

7       The following Affidavits were tendered by the parties during the trial:

> By the Father:

>> a.       The Father’s Affidavit affirmed on 18 July 2018 (“C1”);

>> b.       The Father’s Affidavit affirmed on 15 August 2018 (“C2”);

> By the Mother:

>> g.       The Father’s Affidavit tendered in respect of MSS xxx/2016, MSS xxx/2016 and MSS xxx/2016 affirmed on 27 December 2016 (“R7”);

>> h.       The Mother’s Affidavit tendered in respect of MSS xxx/2016, MSS xxx/2016 and MSS xxx/2016 affirmed on 3 March 2017 (“R8”);

## Dismissal of the Father’s application for a downward variation of maintenance

8       During the trial, I considered first the Father’s application for a variation of the Consent Order. The Father had filed an application for a downward variation of maintenance and requested that the children’s school fees be capped at $500 per month for the 2 children. He contended that his salary as an employee had fallen from $19,500 at the time of the Consent Order to $10,000 in April 2018. It was his position that in light of this, a material change in his circumstances had occurred, warranting a downward variation of the maintenance for the children.

9       As the Father has not filed an appeal against my decision to dismiss his application for a downward variation, I will not be setting forth my detailed reasons for such dismissal save to say that upon consideration of the evidence tendered by the parties and after hearing from each party during the trial, I did not accept that the Father had suffered a material change of circumstances and accordingly dismissed his application to vary the Consent Order.

## The Mother’s application for enforcement of arrears

10     I then moved onto consider the Mother’s application for the enforcement of arrears in light of my dismissal of the Father’s application for variation of the maintenance amount reflected in the Consent Order. I proceeded first to determine the amount of arrears in question and thereafter considered the Father’s capacity to pay those arrears.

## Quantum of arrears

11     The Mother claimed that an amount of $73,477 remained outstanding as arrears of maintenance as at the date of the first hearing on 7 March 2019. This comprised of school fees for the international school the children were currently attending, school year end expenses for 2018, Madrasah year end expenses for 2018, medical and dental expenses, tuition fees for the elder child, costs of counselling for the elder child as well as holiday expenses for the 2 children. Of the total amount of $73,477, an amount of $64,011 was for both children’s school fees for Semester 2 of 2018 and Semester 1 of 2019 and also included an amount referred to as technology fees charged by the school[^1].

12     During the trial on 7 March 2019, counsel for the parties informed me that they had reached agreement on the calculation of the quantum of arrears. The final quantum depended on whether the Father’s application to cap the children’s school fees on a backdated basis would be allowed but in general, parties were in agreement on the calculation of the quantum of all the relevant items[^2].

13     As I had dismissed the Father’s variation application, I considered that the quantum of arrears stood at $73,477.

## The Father’s ability to pay the outstanding arrears

14     I next turned to assessing the ability of the Father to pay off the amount of arrears owed.

> _The Father’s reduction in his salary_

> a.     The Father had claimed that his salary had been reduced from $19,500 at the time of the Consent Order to $10,000 in April 2018 and accordingly he was not able to pay for the relevant arrears. I noted the following from the trial:

>> (i)       The Father tendered salary slips in support of his contention. Upon closer examination of his bank statements however, I noted that notwithstanding that his salary slips showed that he had been paid a salary of $12,000 in January 2018, the evidence pointed to the fact that the Father had actually received an amount of $17,000[^3]. This fact was not disputed by the Father but yet he did not provide nor attempt to provide a satisfactory explanation of this discrepancy.

>> (ii)       The Father maintained that he was only an employee of xxx xxx Pte Ltd (“Company A”) but admitted that he had previously held 50,000 shares in the Company. He claimed to have sold these shares to the current secretary of Company A but seemed unsure of when this transfer had taken place initially stating that it took place in 2017 and then later changing his evidence stating that this transfer was effected in “early 2015 or 2014”[^4]. While it was not disputed that the shares had indeed been transferred, I noted that no details were provided by the Father as to the terms of the transfer, why the transfer was effected and whether he had received any consideration for the transfer of shares. In light of this, I found that notwithstanding that the shares were no longer legally held by the Father, it was unclear to me whether the beneficial title to the shares had in fact been transferred.

>> (iii).       The Father was a director of Company A[^5]. In addition to this, he admitted to also being a director and shareholder of xxx xxx Pte Ltd (“Company B”)[^6]. His linkedin profile showed that he was a director of xxx Group (“the Group”) which according to the Father was not an official company but essentially referred to a loose umbrella under which Company A and Company B were housed[^7].

>> (iv)       The Father admitted during cross examination that his salary slips tendered in the earlier 2016 proceedings i.e. MSS xxx/2016, MSS xxx/2016 and MSS xxx/2016 (collectively “2016 proceedings”) in relation to his salary and bonus were not consistent with the actual amounts he had actually received in his bank account during that time[^8].

> Taking all of the above into account, it appeared to me that while officially an employee of Company A, the evidence appeared to suggest that the Father still currently managed and had control over Company A and Company B, companies interlinked and operating under the Group. This led me to conclude that the Father held a position in the Group where he was in control and could dictate exactly the amount of salary he was to officially receive each month as well as the documents to be issued by Company A in support of this salary. I accordingly did not accept that the Father had suffered a reduction of his salary and was not satisfied that there had been a material change of his circumstances from the date of the Consent Order.

#### The Father’s investments

15     The Father had not in his evidence tendered any information on his investments. While he asserted that he was not aware that he needed to include this information, I found this somewhat surprising notwithstanding that he was represented by Counsel throughout the proceedings.

16     During cross examination, when Counsel for the Mother referred him to his AVIVA Policy No xxx (“Policy X”) and Zurich Vista Policy No xxx (“Policy Y”), the Father admitted that these policies were still in existence. The Father also did not dispute that Mother’s contentions that these were investment linked policies. With regard to the Policy X, he agreed on cross examination that based on an estimated escalation of 10% per annum (which he agreed was reasonable) the sum assured would have increased to a current value of GBP 1,083,355 (S$1,964,021)[^9]. With regard to the Policy Y, he informed the Court that he continues to pay premiums of $1,000 each month and agreed to the current estimated value at S$70,518 as at December 2018[^10].

17     The Father also referred to a previous Investment Scheme with Old Mutual to which he had been depositing funds which had been transferred to another savings policy. While no further detail of this was provided, the Father agreed on cross examination that the current value of this investment was estimated at around GBP 163,000 (S$295,504)[^11]. While on the stand, he also confirmed after being questioned about his February 2018 bank statement[^12], that he continues to invest $1,000 every month in another wealth management fund based in Singapore[^13].

18     Taking into account all of the above, it was clear to me that the Father had the financial resources to pay the outstanding arrears. I considered that these investments may not be immediately liquid and accordingly did not make orders requiring the Father to pay the entire amount immediately. To allow him time to organise his finances, I made orders requiring the amount of $73,477 to be paid in 3 instalments of $24,492, $24,492.50 and $24.492.50 on each of 1 May 2019, 1 June 2019 and 1 July 2019.

## Conclusion

20     Taking all of the above into consideration, I was satisfied that the Father had the financial resources to pay for the arrears. In light of my decision to dismiss the Father’s application for a downward variation of maintenance as well as my final decision on the payment if arrears by the Father, I ordered costs of $3,000 to be paid by the Father to the Mother.
