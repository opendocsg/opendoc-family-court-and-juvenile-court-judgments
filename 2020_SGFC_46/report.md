ADOPTION – DISPENSATION of consent of natural parents – WELFARE of child

19 May 2020

### District Judge Shobha G. Nair:

1       The straitened choice before the Court was this: to endorse the request of foster parents to adopt a 5-year-old twin boy they had been looking after since birth _or_ to return him to his natural mother who is soon to complete an imprisonment term. I allowed the adoption. Against this order, the natural parents have appealed.

## Chronology of Key Events

2       There were 3 officers from the Child Protection Services (collectively referred to as CPO) who were assigned to work with the family of the twins at various points in time. The 2nd and 3rd officers have filed affidavits. I will be referring to them for purposes of laying out the key events, which formed the factual backdrop of this matter.**[^1]**

3       The child \[B\] and his twin sister \[C\] were born prematurely on 21 September 2014. The twins had medical concerns and stayed on in the hospital for care to be given. B had psoriasis, clubfoot and an inguinal hernia which required surgery. Prior to the delivery of her twins, the natural mother \[NM\] was incarcerated for a drug related offence. She was released from prison in February 2014. The natural father \[NF\] was serving sentence for drug related offences at the time of the birth of his twins. A medical social worker (MSW) at the Kandang Kerbau Women and Children’s Hospital \[KKH\] had concerns about the level of the NM’s commitment towards the caregiving of her twins. She did not visit her twins regularly while they were in hospital. The Child Protection Services (CPS) wing of the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSFD) was contacted by the MSW on 17 November 2014. The NM was known to the CPS because her eldest daughter \[M\] from another relationship, was the subject of a Care and Protection Order.

4       The natural parents \[NP\] and the NM’s extended family took particular issue with much of the 2nd CPO’s findings and felt that she was judgmental in her views of the family. Her affidavit speaks of how she tried to engage the NM and encourage visitations. The NM informed that she was not able to visit her twins regularly at the hospital because she was stressed over the fact that the NF was in prison at the time and was not able to provide her with the support she needed. Her asthmatic condition was also troubling her. The situation was made worse according to the NM, because she was having difficulty managing M who was residing at a Children’s Home at the time and was running into various difficulties at the Home.

5       There was an agreement between CPS and the NM that the NM would visit the twins at least twice a week. She did manage daily visits between 15 December and 21 December 2014 but she did not show up regularly from 22 December 2014. This she attributed to being preoccupied with matters relating to her brother’s arrest for a criminal matter.

6       There were also difficulties engaging the NM on long-term plans for the twins. When efforts at reaching out to her failed, the CPO made a visit to the NM’s home and found her asleep. The NM explained that she thought the visit would be made by the CPO at her home and at a different time. Around this time too, the maternal grandmother (MGM) had reported that the NM was suffering from “low mood” and hallucinations.

7       The twins were ready for discharge in December 2014 but the MGM, a possible candidate for care as suggested by the NM, was in India, for treatment of a health concern experienced by her youngest daughter \[S\]. S was born with Trisomy-21 (Down’s Syndrome). The CPO explored the possibility of discharge of the twins to the care of other family members. The MGM was not contactable when in India for the duration of November 2014 to February 2015.**[^2]** The MGF was not proposed as an option. The NM’s brother (MU) and his wife were going through marital problems of their own. The NM proposed a friend’s relative. The CPO opined that all candidates proposed were not suitable. They asked that the NP consider foster care as an option. It was alleged by the NP that they were pressured into this option. The CPO refuted this allegation and laid out how the Voluntary Care Agreements came to be signed by the NP.**[^3]** The NF had not moved in a positive direction to name anyone in his family who was willing to give care. After discussing a few conditions to agreeing to foster care, he signed on the Voluntary Care Agreement (VCA). On seeing that the NF had agreed to it, the NM signed on it as well.**[^4]** B was handed to the applicants under the foster arrangement while C was handed to a different family. The VCA was extended each time it expired, with the consent of the NP. The last VCA signed was to allow foster care until December 2015. In 2015, the NP found themselves serving prison sentences again, for drug related offences. When the NF was released from prison in September 2015 and the NM in October 2015, they were uncontactable until January 2016. The NM later claimed that she wanted to settle issues pertaining to her job and romantic partners.

8       In January 2016, there were added challenges associated with the care of M, which the NM seemed to be unable to effectively attend to. As the VCA would expire within the year, the NM proposed the MGM as an alternative caregiver for the twins as she was not in a position to step forward. The officer shared that the MGM had diabetes, was taking care of her elderly mother-in-law who had medical concerns of her own and S. She was relying on financial assistance to support the family. The MGF was not willing to support the financial needs of the twins at that time. M was also due to reintegrate with the family, having spent substantial time at a Girls’ Home and this weighed heavily on the MGM.

9       There were efforts to reintegrate the twins in March 2016. However, B had by this time, formed deep attachment to the foster family and displayed separation anxiety when brought to visit his natural family. Around this point in time, the CPS was informed by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) that the NP were wanted for failure to report for urine tests. Between May and November 2016, the NP parents remained uncontactable.

10     Despite the lack of contact with the NP, the CPO continued to engage the MGM with respect to access. The MGM alleged that the CPS lacked sincerity in its efforts at effective reintegration. The CPO disagreed with the allegation, taking pains to explain that insofar as permanency planning was concerned, the first effort would be to explore reintegration. Details of the various attempts at providing access can be found at Annex B of the 3rd CPO’s affidavit.**[^5]**

11     As the VCA had expired and the NP were uncontactable, the CPS brought the matter to the Youth Court for a Care and Protection Order. This was issued in August 2016 and the care of B was to remain with the applicants for an interim period of 4 months. The NP were not present at this hearing.

12     In November 2016, the NP were arrested. The NM was sentenced to a 5 year imprisonment term and is currently at a halfway house from where she is due to be discharged in August 2020. The NF is awaiting his trial for a drug trafficking charge, which carries on conviction, the possibility of capital punishment.

13     Further Care and Protection Orders were issued by the Youth Court. At the time of the hearing of this matter, B was under a Care and Protection Order issued in November 2018 for a period of two years. The NP were present at the hearings before the Youth Court in 2016 and 2018 and gave their consent to the Care and Protection Orders. At the hearing in November 2018, they had indicated that they objected to any attempt to have B adopted by the foster parents.**[^6]**

## The Position of the NP and NM’s Extended Family

14     The NM had never wanted the twins to be adopted. In her affidavit**[^7]**, she expressed disbelief in having to “_defend myself as a mother_.”**[^8]** Her position and one echoed by the NF, MGM, MGF and M was that the 2nd CPO was judgmental of the family and their situation. She also took issue with the lack of help rendered to her before CPS stepped in. After delivering the twins, she said that she was in emotional and financial distress and what she needed was assistance. Instead, she was “_flat out judged by those who could have spotted my condition and rendered me the assistance that my children and I needed_.”**[^9]** She suggested that she did the best that she could and went on to speak about each of her other children. She explained that she had M at a very young age and to protect M from the abuse at the hand of her father, she was removed from him and M spent some time in a foster care setting. The records reveal that M’s father returned to take her back but NM intervened. When M was in primary 1, there were difficulties in school and she was placed in a Children’s Home. The NM shared about her two other children aged 14 and 11 from her relationship with another man. She had married their father in 2010. She explained that these children were cared for by her husband’s family and that she was content with that arrangement. During the course of the hearing, the Court came to understand that she would at some point in the future be seeking a divorce from her husband. She met the NF of the twins sometime in 2014. Apart from the twins, she has another son with the NF. This son, \[K\] is currently 2 years of age. K was born while the NM was serving her sentence in prison and it was then that she says she was overwhelmed with a sense of sadness and began to realise the harm that she was causing all her children. She made a decision to change her life around for them. She decided to study for the ‘N’ (Technical) level examinations and increase her chances of better employment when she was discharged from prison. According to the CPO, K is doing relatively well in the care of MGM. While it was the NM’s contention that the fact K was thriving in MGM’s care was reason for the return of the twins to MGM, it also highlights the fact that CPS was not out to harm the natural family nor separate the twins from their natural family as alleged repeatedly by the NP. Clearly, K’s situation was different from B and Cs. K was delivered when the NM was still serving sentence. The NM was not in a position to act or omit to act as it related to the needs of K.

15     The NF’s position was not that he could parent B. He was of the view that B ought to be with his maternal family. He did not express any particular confidence in the mother of the child nor offer any hope-centred plans for the child. His position was based purely on biological links rather more than an awareness of the duties of parenthood. His grievance was summed up by his words (referring to the CPS) : “_Whoever give them this power – the child is ours and how dare they, like giving out chocolates they are giving out our child._”**[^10]**

16     As at the time M filed her affidavit in March 2019, she had been discharged from the Girls’ Home and placed in another residential home for teenagers. This was because she was not able to reintegrate with MGM’s family when she was ready for discharge from the Girls’ Home. The stay at the residential home for teenage girls was to enable independent living. It was also to allow her to commence studies at an Institute of Technical Education (ITE). M had been cared for in different institutions for a very long time. She, like her mother, was aggrieved by the words of the 2nd CPO. She felt that the officer was biased and reported unfairly on her when she ran off from the Children’s Home. She claimed that she did so only to see her mother and grandmother. She expressed that she harmed herself only because she was misunderstood. She spoke highly of her mother and passionately about her desire to have a family. She claimed that “_MSF lacks compassion._”**[^11]**At the time of the hearing, a brief few months since the filing of her affidavit, M was no longer in the care of the residential home for teenagers. Even while at this facility, she chose to run off in June 2019 to stay with her aunt. After a few weeks there, she went to stay with the MGM. At the time of the hearing before me, she had only spent a few months with the MGM. The MGM was not her first choice when she ran off from the residential facility and this reflected the words of the CPO who had spoken about the inability of the MGM to manage M in the past.

17     The MGM claimed that she was always willing to take care of the twins and had always been ready for access. She felt that the CPS misjudged her and that she had never once expressed that she was agreeable to adoption. She spoke of a time when the MSF had agreed to allow supervised access at the home of the MGM but it was cancelled as the MU was present. It was the MGM’s view that the MSF was finding ways to deny access and contact. She also pointed to the fact that K was under her care and was thriving.

18     The MGF was similarly disappointed with the CPS. He claimed to have a united family and vouched his support, hoping “_that the return of the twins will help_” the natural mother “_improve her own life and lead it more meaningfully_.**[^12]** “_We feel helpless and not sure who to turn to because there are government bodies and they always talk with authority which we cannot challenge them easily. They also have their way to speak to us. We are a simple family and have nothing to hide_.”**[^13]** This show of support in his affidavit was a shift in position from the time he had discussions with the CPO and the omission to address some key facts found in the CPO’s affidavits, was noteworthy. I will address this later.

19     The NM and MGM had filed further affidavits after the 3rd CPO had filed her affidavit.**[^14]** The natural mother took grave offence that her 6 children were said to have been fathered by 4 different men when it was in fact 3 men. While this undoubtedly would cause unhappiness, this mistake appears to have been a result of the fact that the NF of K is not named in his birth certificate. As I had mentioned to counsel for the NP at various case conferences, it may serve K’s interests if the paternity could be established and entered into K’s birth certificate. I am not aware if this has been done.

20     The NM was of the view that the MSF “_entirely orchestrated_” the distance between B and his family “_possibly also pandering to the foster parents request and demands_” and misled the natural family as “_they always wanted to take the children away_”.**[^15]** She insisted that she was a changed person, free from the influence of drugs. She challenged any notion that the MU was a poor influence if allowed to continue to live in the MGM’s home. She urged the Court to look at the way K was thriving in the care of MGM.

21     In her second affidavit, the MGM repeated her earlier positions and said that she had never told the MSF that she was incapable of caring for the children but simply that she may need to rely on the financial support of the NM and MGF. She alleged that she may have been misunderstood by the CPO as there was no interpreter of the language she was more conversant in, present during the visits by the CPS. Her only limitation as a caregiver she claimed, was that she was not wealthy. She felt that the CPO betrayed her trust in reporting on matters which did not fairly reflect her intentions or beliefs.

## Investigations by the Guardian-in-Adoption

22     The application for adoption by the foster parents called on the need to appoint the Director of Social Welfare to act as Guardian-in Adoption. Such appointment allowed for investigations into the matter. The GIA recommended the adoption. In so doing, the GIA enclosed with her affidavit, a few articles pertaining to separation and reunification of families which provided good guidance.**[^16]**

23     The applicants have been taking care of B since his discharge from the hospital after his birth. They live in a comfortably furnished 4-room HDB flat. The male applicant is 63 years old and is an Assistant Operations Manager. The female applicant is 53 years old and a homemaker. They have living with them, two adult daughters. The older daughter is 27 years of age and a Senior English Teacher. The second daughter is 23 years of age and indicated that she would be looking for employment after this case was concluded. She was assisting her mother to take care of B.

24     The applicants shared a good relationship and their daughters spoke well of their parents and their ability to care for B. They confirmed their support for the child. Of significance is that all of B’s medical concerns had been carefully attended to by the applicants and he no longer needs any significant medical attention. He attends kindergarten and enjoys craft and swimming classes. He has his own bedroom and the applicants have filled the home with age appropriate toys and books. More importantly, they spend time together as a family and share warm and supportive relationships.

25     The NM and MGM both agreed that B had been well looked after by the applicants and they took no issue with the level of care. They thanked the applicants for stepping up at a time they could not but indicated that they were now ready to have B back. They had also confirmed that they would not be agreeing to any adoption request for B’s twin sister but made no call for the return of C at this time if the foster parents were willing to continue with care. They were aware that C had special needs but did not appear to know the extent of the same.

26     The MGM’s home is a 3 room HDB flat. It is occupied by her, her mother-in-law, the MU, S, M and K. That would be 6 individuals. There was reference to the presence of the MU’s girlfriend in the oral evidence of the MGF as well as the GIA’s affidavit in which case, there are 7 individuals. The MGF was at the time of the CPO investigations reported to have been living separately from the family for the last 20 years and was said to have another family in Indonesia. He visited his family in Singapore about 3 times a week and provided some support to the family when he visited. Once the NM is released from the halfway house, she would be returning to the MGM’s home. She intends to bring B to this home and eventually her twin daughter. The potential number of occupants would be 9 and in the event MU’s girlfriend is present, then 10.

27     There were grave concerns about MU. During investigations into the matter, he did not file an affidavit as he was not keen on being engaged by the MSF. The CPO informed that excessive alcohol consumption resulting in domestic violence were issues of concern that they had wanted to address with the MU. There was suggestion that the MU was going through marital problems arising from these very concerns. S had informed that she too was a victim of his violence. The MGM’s mother-in-law spoke of the same concerns. The MU has a record of 12 criminal offences for which he spent 3 terms of imprisonment. As the long-term accommodation plans of the MU was of relevance to the environment that B would be placed in should he return to the MGM’s home, I asked if he would like to address the Court. He chose to file an affidavit which addressed areas that were not directed.**[^17]** This affidavit was ordered to be expunged from the records and a new affidavit addressing the accommodation plans to be filed.**[^18]** The GIA was invited to indicate if they needed to conduct further investigations on the matters addressed by the MU as they were not able to interview him when they were conducting their investigations. The GIA informed that the contents of the CPO’s affidavit had sufficiently addressed the concerns they had.

28     The life events of M were of significance. She is 18 years of age and has spent most of her years in various homes and institutions. She moved from foster care to a Children’s Home to a Girls’ Home and then to a residential facility for teenagers. After her stay at the Girls Home, and before her move to the residential facility, reintegration of M into the home of MGM was assessed to be unsuitable. This was as recent as January 2019. On 12 June 2019, just a few months before the hearing, M decide to run away from the residential facility and reside with her aunt. Weeks later, she ran from her aunt’s place and started to stay with her MGM.

29     The extended family was struggling with finances. During investigations by the CPO, the MGF reported that he provided $700 per month for the family expenses while the MGM said she was provided with $500 per month. In his affidavit, the MU stated that he was staying with the family to support them “_physically and financially_” although he did not specify how this was done. He said he would help them “_as and when_” he could.**[^19]** The evidence of his parents suggest that he provided some money at times for basic provisions but that he was not asked to live with them so that they could have his support. The family received family assistance from external sources especially for the care of K. The initial figure was reduced when it was discovered that the MGM had savings in the tune of $16 000 which she did not declare when she applied for assistance. She claimed that it was for funeral expenses of a relative but later the maternal grandparents claimed that it was spent on renovating the flat. They also received food donations and the GIA noted that there was at times difficulty paying towards utility bills. Even the MGM who suffers from diabetes has not received consistent medical attention and medication on account of a lack of funds.

30     The NM stated that she would live with the MGM on her discharge from the halfway house. She would have to work to support her children and hopes to eventually rent a flat close to her mother’s home. She acknowledged that she had to clear rental in arrears of the flat she occupied prior to her arrest in 2016. There were plans to live together with the NF if he is released from prison. In any event, the NF did not share any plans to care for his children. His position was that the MGM was an appropriate caregiver.

## The Applicable Adoption Laws

31     The case centred on whether there was a need for the consent of the parents given that both objected to the application for the adoption of B. In this respect, s 4 (4) of the Adoption of Children Act (Cap 4) (ACA) provides that:

> _No adoption order shall be made except with the consent of every person who is a parent or guardian of the infant in respect of whom the application is made or who has the actual custody of the infant or who is liable to contribute to the support of the infant but the court may dispense with any consent required by this subsection_ **_if the court is satisfied that the person whose consent is to be dispensed with_** _–_

>> (_a_)     _has abandoned, neglected, persistently ill-treated the infant and cannot be found and that reasonable notice of the application for an adoption order to the parent or guardian where the parent or guardian can be found;_

>> (_b_)     _is unfit by reason of any physical or mental incapacity to have the care and control of the infant, that the unfitness is likely to continue indefinitely and that reasonable notice of the application for an adoption order has been given to the parent or guardian;_ **_or_**

>> (_c_)     _ought in all the circumstances of the case to be dispensed with, notwithstanding that such person may have made suitable initial arrangements for the infant by placing the infant under the care of the authorities of a home for children and young persons, the protector under the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap38) or some other person._

32     The Court before making an adoption order shall by virtue of s 5 of the ACA, be satisfied –

> (_a_)     _That every person whose consent is necessary under this Act and whose consent is not dispensed with has consented to and understands the nature and effect of the adoption order for which the application is made, and in particular in the case of any parent understands that the effect of the adoption order will be permanently to deprive him or her of his or her parental rights;_

> (_b_)     _that the order if made will be for the welfare of the infant, due consideration being for this purpose given to the wishes of the infant, having regard to the age and understanding of the infant; and_

> (_c_)     _that the applicant has not received or agreed to receive, and that no person has made or given, or agreed to make or give to the applicant, any payment or other reward in consideration of the adoption except such as the court may sanction._

## The Issues and Findings

## (i)    Were the applicants a good choice for the long term care of B **?**

33     I address the undisputed issue first. The NP agreed that the applicants provided good care to B. The natural family was appreciative of the efforts expended on the raising of B. I had asked the counsel for the applicants if they were willing to continue with foster care if the adoption was not allowed. The counsel stated that they would not be willing to as deep attachments had been formed. Any more time with the child only to have to release him to the natural family eventually would be too difficult for all concerned and particularly, B. I had asked this question as the natural family appeared to be comfortable with the idea that the foster arrangement continue while the NM works on stabilising her situation upon her release from the halfway house. Even after her release, various self-care/advancement programmes have been planned for her by the halfway house as part of rehabilitative efforts. The NP’s focus appeared to be not wanting to be deprived of all parental rights permanently. The natural family was not in a rush to receive C, the twin sister so long as there was no adoption request at this time. What the NM seemed to be more concerned about was why the MSF was only interested in the adoption of B and not C. The MSF had explained that the reason is because no suitable person has indicated interest to adopt C. The natural family are aware of the special needs of C and apart from one time when the MGM indicated in Court that she wanted to have the twins back immediately, there was no determined move to have C home at this time.

34     There was no doubt in my mind that the applicants were good candidates for the adoption of B. I noted that the male applicant and female applicants were in an age group where parenting of a young child may not be as physically comfortable than when they were perhaps raising their own daughters. Having said that, there was a significant age difference between the male and female applicants, they were in good health and were assisted by their daughters, both of whom were well educated and providing the necessary support for the raising of B. The relationships within the family were of a nature and tone that even if there were changes such as the daughters moving away from the home or the applicants being physically unable to provide the same level of care for B as they had done in the last 5 years, the family had the capacity to assist each other to ensure the continued wellbeing of B over the next decade and beyond.

## (ii) Are the Natural Parents ready for parenting?

35     The NP were correct in saying, albeit in somewhat colourful language at times, that their rights over B are paramount. The law itself makes it mandatory for their consent to be provided. In certain circumstances however, this consent can be dispensed with. The law recognises in other words, that the paramount rights of parents have a fraternal twin - in the shape of parental responsibilities. Where it is evident that the twin set of responsibilities cannot be embraced, alternative plans may need to be looked into for the child.

36     The reason why B and his twin sister are in different foster homes has everything to do with the actions of the NP. Even after the birth of the children in September 2014, both parents found themselves serving sentences for repeated drug offences. Despite clear attempts at engaging the parents with a view towards reintegration, the parents spared no effort in blaming the MSF for what they perceived as determined efforts to separate the children from them. No possible motive was afforded save that the MSF did not exercise best efforts and was giving in to the demands of the applicants. The applicants are not individuals who are in any position to influence the course of MSF investigations nor is there cause to imagine why MSF would be so influenced by anyone. The applicants represent the typical Singaporean family with the distinguishing mark of possessing love for the children of others. It was the evidence of the MSF that the applicants did not raise the possibility of adopting B and only considered it seriously when notified by the CPS that reunification efforts were not showing promise. It was only in May 2017 when there was official approval from senior management of the CPS for adoption to be looked into.**[^20]** The NP were uncontactable for a good part of 2016 and were issued with long prison sentences in 2017 after being arrested in November 2016. This was just 2- 3 years prior to the adoption hearing in 2019. The repeated breaches of the law and the attempts by the NP to run away from them were not the acts of youthful foolhardiness nor acts done a decade or two ago. They are adults in their thirties who in the recent past, were still running foul of the law and who by running from the law, left their children in the care of others. Even in that brief time between their arrest in November 2016 and their 2017 prison sentences,**[^21]** the NM went on to conceive K while the MSF went to great lengths to reach out to them in an effort to provide permanent plans for the twins. It is clear from the evidence on the efforts at engagement and access that the MSF did what they were tasked to do – to unify families unless it was clear that unification would compromise the best interests of the child.

37     I say little about the NF’s position save that even if he is acquitted of the criminal charge(s) he faces, he had not offered any plans for the care of his children. His plan was to allow the NM’s family to raise his children. I noted that a good part of the contents of his affidavit were a mirror of the words found in the NM’s affidavit. I found this disturbing as there appears to be no application of his mind to the matter.

## (iii) Is the NM likely to complete her path of recovery?

38     It must be the hope of every criminal justice system to rehabilitate individuals who find themselves behind bars and thereby reduce the rate of recidivism. The NM was released from prison in 2019 to a halfway house where she is exposed to various programmes and activities to prepare her for reintegration into society. She is due to be discharged in August 2020. It is heartening to see the NM improve herself and obtain three passes in the 2019 ‘N’ (T) level examinations.

39     In Court, the NM spoke of how she had an epiphany of sorts when she delivered K while she was serving sentence in prison. She realised that she had neglected her children and decided to take steps to turn her life around on her discharge from prison. I applaud her for it and I did not doubt her sincerity. I had to however assess her capacity for change in the short to medium term against the backdrop of her history and by discerning the likely needs of B who is about to launch into formal schooling next year (primary school) with all its demands, opportunities and new relationships.

40     Every time in the recent past (2014 -2016) when the NM was back in society, she had found herself in trouble with drugs. This time, she was in prison for a substantially longer period of time. This afforded her a longer period for rehabilitation and her time at the halfway house would no doubt provide her with the skills and spirit necessary for change. The GIA reported that the Singapore Prisons Reoffending Risk Assessment exercise disclosed that the NM fell within the moderate category for the risk of reoffending and in the medium category for drug dependency. In other words, the risk was neither high nor low.[^22]

41     Her willingness to change this time (she had mentioned this too after a previous incarceration) and maintain that change, will be tested once she is discharged in a few months. With the NF in prison, the exposure to drugs may be less. The pull of drugs however cannot be underestimated. It takes family and community support and individual grit and resolve to overcome this. Her history does not speak well. It is hoped that her future will speak rather more favourably. It would not be possible for me to say with absolute certainty that change is definite. It is certainly possible. The situation at home however is not encouraging. The support needs to come from external sources and her own determination. I do encourage her to commit to change, whether all her children are with her or not. In this regard, I noted that the NM and her parents stated that having the children with the NM would motivate her to change and lead a meaningful life. In my view, her children cannot be agents for her change but rather, her change would occasion a better life for her children. The reality is also that she was not seeking to care for all her children as her 2nd and 3rd children remain with her husband’s family. In the GIA’s affidavit[^23] it was reported that the NM had initially indicated that she did not need contact with the two children as that may encourage her husband to reconnect with her. She changed her position later in 2019 and decided to write to them. The MGM and MGF had little if any contact with these grandchildren and did not appear to be moved to do anything with respect to gaining proper access to them.

42     Assuming that NM is able to turn her life around, the question in my mind was the timeframe within which change could take place. The NM is due to be discharged in August 2020. She had indicated that she would need to work to support her children and trusted the MGM to give care to B. She has not held a job in the last few years and with the current global pandemic, the prospects for a lady in her 30s with ‘N’ (T) level qualifications may not be as promising as was anticipated even as recently as 2019. This is a potential source of stress. If she manages to find suitable work, the care of B would be left to alternative caregivers in the home. The NM will not be able to give the right amount of time and special attention to B in a way this child needs and is accustomed to. Further, the load carried by the MGM is not a light one.

## (iv) The Suitability of the Extended Family

43     B is a child with deep attachment to his foster family and deep anxiety about any significant change as evidenced during access times and my time with him. I met B in the children’s room at the family court. He came with the younger of his foster sisters. He was initially shy and clung on to his foster sister. In about half an hour, he warmed up and we played as we talked. I had wanted to assess how comfortable he would be in the presence of a stranger to assess the possibility of any further efforts at reunification. The sister managed to leave the room for a short while but he asked me repeatedly where she was. As we continued to enjoy our playtime, I noted that he was an articulate and happy child. It was possible to introduce strangers to him but he needed to know that his foster family was not far away. This was not unexpected.

44     B is at the crossroads of his young life. Having been left in the hospital at birth, his sense of belonging and security are contingent on continued good ties with the only family he has known. A dramatic shift to a new environment where he knows no one and where his parents do not as yet reside, will in my mind cause long term irreparable damage. The GIA provided the Court with a fair bit of reading on the developmental needs and attachments formed by children of this age. He is about to embark on primary school education and it is a significant phase in his life. The need to have a secure environment and sufficient encouragement to do his best in school augers well for his future.

45     The life of M is, as stated by the GIA, a cautionary tale. The family of the NM was always available for her. Just as they are putting themselves forward for B today. Yet, M found herself moving from one institution to another. Her current stay in the MGM’s home is one engineered by M and not because history spoke of it being a conducive setting. The GIA spoke of the inability of the MGM to get along with M.[^24] There was also conflict between her and the MU. At the time of the hearing, the family spoke of how unified they were and how poorly the MSF understood the dynamics of their relationships. The facts do not paint a picture of a tight network of family support. It spoke of a family who had poor insight into what was needed to build a strong and protective force for the young members of the family. Instead, it spoke of a family that placed a large premium on biological ties and was content with the semblance of family. The adult family members were all quite comfortable leaving their children with others as they continue to work through their challenges so long as there was no permanent severance of ties. Even this understanding of family could of course work. It works for many families. It cannot however work effectively in the context of a family torn apart by drugs. There is a real risk of it rearing its head again to cause further destruction. It similarly cannot work effectively where a child was abandoned at birth and who by this fact, was separated from his twin sister and who will continue not to know all his siblings and half siblings. What he knows today and has known since birth is the nature of a higher form of love coming from strangers.

46     The MGM and MGF minimised the nature of MU’s negative interactions with the people he lives with. The GIA’s affidavit spoke of how M witnessed MU’s aggressive behaviour; how MU had committed violence on a girlfriend who appears to also be in MGM’s house; how S shared that “_the girl and \]MU\] fight everytime_”; how the MU “_drink already will get angry_” and the MGM’s mother-in-law confirming the violent tendencies of MU.[^25]

47     What is disconcerting is not that the MU may drink excessively and commit acts of violence, but that the family does not see it as an impediment to the welfare and progress of B. The family explained that MU goes into his room if he has had too much to drink. It was the MGM’s position that MU is her son and that she would remove B from any potential unfavourable scene occasioned by MU’s behaviour. I appreciated that it is difficult for the MGM to ask that her son live elsewhere but if there are to be serious efforts to make it possible for B to thrive in a new environment, every step towards that possibility must be taken. It is not a common situation where children may be asked to accommodate the idiosyncrasies of a relative who needs shelter for a period of time. The home needs to be designed to assist in B’s reintegration, failing which it will likely harm him in ways that may not be immediately noticeable.

48     When called on to give an affidavit on his future plans, I noted that the MU made it a point to state that he found my direction somewhat odd but that he would address it anyway to help his family. His statement to the Court hints at his personality and offers a glimpse of the reality of the environment into which B is asked to be returned. He claimed to have returned to the home to help his parents. The reality is that he needs to stay there as he goes through his divorce proceedings. The fact that the deterioration of his relationship with his wife and son involves elements of violence is telling of a propensity to be unable to control anger. In this regard, the MGM shared in Court that MU was going through his 2nd divorce and appears to have other children who the family has little contact with. Nothing turned on it so I say no more on this. Also telling were his 12 criminal offences, which included a conviction on a charge of criminal force. MU will not be a source of confidence for B. I had little to suggest that he would make space for B, both physically and emotionally.

49     Counsel for the natural family repeatedly emphasised that the family may not be wealthy but loved their children. Loving one’s own children is in the nature of humans. Parenting calls for much higher bars. It involves putting the child’s needs ahead of that of the parent. It calls for consistency, discipline, sacrifice and the provision of basic comforts. I saw little that gave me the confidence that B’s welfare would be served in MGM’s home while he waits for the return of a mother he does not know and the promise of change to materialise. The term “welfare” has been defined in numerous cases and one which was articulated with precision and simplicity was in the context of guardianship proceedings. In **Tan Siew Kee** v **Chua Ah Boey** \[1987\] SLR 549 , Chan Sek Keong, JC (as he then was) stated that the term embraces “.._the general well-being of the child and all aspects of his upbringing - religious, moral as well as physical. His happiness, comfort and security also go to make his wellbeing. A loving parent with a stable home is conducive to the attainment of such well-being. It is not to measured in monetary terms_.”

50     There were two individuals who were positive forces in the home. One was K. The other was S. Insofar as K is concerned, he has been with MGM since his birth and his circumstance is therefore very different from B. He only knows MGM. The true test comes when the NM returns to the home. When she delivered the twins, one of her key stresses was the fact that she did not have the support of the NF. She will not have his support when she is out. She has never taken care of any of her children in a sustained way. It is very likely that the onus will be placed on the MGM. The MGM has many individuals to care for. Even though S appears to be a source of support for the family, I was concerned that the MGM did not understand that she would need to allow S to develop her own skills and lead an independent life. S is not employed and is looked to more as an extra hand at home for the NM’s children. S is an able-bodied young lady who should take steps to help herself so that she may be of assistance to others in a constructive way.

51     The tendency to rely on older children to care for younger children to the exclusion of self- advancement, ultimately harms the older child and the larger family. The reliance on M to work and support the family as a priority over her own advancement is also illustrative of a lack of awareness of the needs of each child in the family. The grandparents were unsure of what examinations M had sat for, the schools she attended and how to have M embrace education fully. Having spent her entire teenage years in external institutions, the family was happy with the idea that she is now 18 and able to contribute financially to the family. Her personal interests are secondary to the needs of the family. This is so even before the arrival of B or C. With more mouths to feed, the stresses are likely to increase and the individuals that are likely to feel these stresses acutely are the children. This is the bleak picture for B.

## The Oral Evidence of the NM and the Extended Family

52     The NM and her family had asked to be present to give evidence in Court. I permitted it. They were subject to cross-examination. In addressing the Court, certain parts of their evidence showed that the results of investigations by the MSF were accurate and also that the family was willing to go to great lengths to exaggerate conditions to present as favourable a picture as possible to the Court.

53     The MGM and MGF differed in their evidence on who took care of the NM as she grew up and for how long. It was the evidence of the MGM that NM was raised by her maternal grandmother till she was 13 years old. When probed further, MGM said that she was working at the time and that she was living alone, away from the family. She would pick NM up every Friday and spend the weekends with her. She made no mention of the MGF.[^26] When the MGF took the witness box, he appeared to be surprised at any suggestion that NM was not raised by him and his wife in her early years. When asked whether the maternal grandmother raised her, he did not appear to recall. He simply said they lived together and painted a united front.[^27] The NM on the other hand, said that she was cared for by her maternal grandmother till she was 9 years of age, also an age which was not consistent with what the MGM had stated.[^28]

54     At the time of the hearing, the MGF stated that he was living in the home with the family. This is at odds with the evidence of the GIA who said that the couple had not been living together in a permanent arrangement for the last 20 years. It is also at odds with the evidence of the MGM who when asked by counsel for the applicants how many people resided at the home, she stated that there were 5 including M. This would be the MGM’s mother-in-law, MU, S, M and K.

55     M too tried to paint a cohesive family when not too long ago, she had shared that she was not emotionally attached to MGM as the latter was too busy for her. She even denied telling the CPO that she had seen NM consuming drugs in her presence. While I completely understood the family’s desire to present a united front, it did not tally with the results of independent investigations done by the CPO and GIA.

56     What was also of concern was the status of M at the time of the hearing. When M filed her affidavit in March 2019, she said that she was at the teenage residential home and that she was in her first year of studies at an Institute of Technical Education. The entire purpose of her stay at the residential facility was to encourage her proper integration into society and education is a cornerstone. After she ran off from the facility and started to reside with the MGM, she was no longer pursuing studies. When asked why, she said that she was working to earn money to start school again in 2020. There was no evidence to say that she would do so. The fact however is that M at just 18 years old, has on her own accord decided where she should be, that working was better at this time so as to support her family. Studies could wait. This path on account of M’s history may not serve her well in the future but was endorsed by MGM and the rest of the family either. When I asked MGM where M was studying prior to her starting work, she said that it was best for the Court to ask M directly as she did not know. She appeared to be happy with the fact that M was earning money to support the family.

> _“\[M\] currently is working, Your Honour. And she is going to work now. She financially support me. She gives me $200.”[^29]_

The recent changes in M’s life was determined by M and not assisted by the family. She was seen just like S, as another hand in the house. Very little attention is paid to her needs. She was very passionate about her family and wanting them to be together again. I understood the desire. It was still of great concern that M is seen as someone who could start supporting the needs of B and the family and who with the help of a vulnerable NM, could take flight at 18 years of age when she did not have the necessary tools.

## Observation of the Child at Play

57     Following my first meeting with the child in the family court and assessing that he was able to meet with strangers provided that a member of his foster family was within reach, I asked to observe him at play in a neutral setting and to allow interaction with the NM. The condition for this interaction was that B was not to know that his mother would be present given his past anxieties. I attended at a playground on 5 February 2020 which was located within a shopping mall and observed B from a distance. Two officers from the MSF were present at the location when the foster sister and B arrived. The NM was accompanied by an officer of the halfway house. B was happy at the playground and interacted mainly with his foster sister although there were a handful of other children at the playground. The NM was observed to have attempted, whenever she was encouraged to do so, to interact with B. She did well in her attempts but B did not respond and was seen to move away often when she started to engage him. At one point, he told his foster sister that he was ready to go off and ran out of the playground without her. I did not ask that he return and the observation ended. It was clear that B would take much time to forge a relationship with his natural family and the transition team would need to take very gradual steps, if attempted. Given that the applicants were clear in their position that any move towards returning B to his natural family would mean that they were unable to continue with foster arrangements, the child would be in another foster home. If transition efforts fail or the NM succumbs to the scourge of drug addiction again, the damage sustained by B will be immense and irreversible.

## Conclusion

58     Before making my orders allowing for the dispensation of the consent of the NP and the adoption of B by the applicants, I shared in my oral grounds issued on 12 February 2020 that one should not be too sceptical of the immense value and power of biology in the parent-child relationship. I repeat that view here. Research is largely supportive of the position that a child’s identity formation and self-knowledge make the parent-child relationship one of the most precious of all human relationships and should be interfered with only if it serves the child better.

59     Looking at the evidence before me, I was of the certain view that B’s interests are better served in the home of the applicants. They have been his parents from the beginning. He is at an age where a completely new environment severing attachments to his foster family and securing links to unfamiliar members of his natural family would be detrimental to his long term well-being. The new environment is one where there are significant risks to the proper development of B. Additionally, the child will first be returned to his natural family, not his natural parents. His father will not be present in his life. Even if the NM is physically present for B later this year, she cannot be expected to be emotionally present for him immediately. The road to recovery is a long one. A road that will take time to complete and is likely to have quite a few forks along the way. The child grows in accordance with his own schedule – one that cannot wait too long for his NM to catch up with. He has already waited for far too long. He has no ties with his twin sister. When a child loses one or both parents, the support that siblings could give each other should not be underestimated. The tragedy of the separation was not occasioned by the CPS. If anything, they took the needed and much harder step of pulling the twins in a timely way, out of a situation where they were likely to transit from one home to another as their parents take their time to prepare themselves for parenting. B’s story speaks of the devastating impact of drug use on families. It is a story that must allow for a better ending. I am of the view that the applicants are better equipped to ensure the best outcome for B’s future.
