Child’s Custody – Care And Maintenance Orders

10 March 2021

### District Judge Toh Wee San:

## Background facts

1       This was an application by the Plaintiff mother for various child orders in respect of the child she had with the Defendant father. Both parties are citizens of the United States (US). They got married in the US on 26 May 2007 but the said marriage was annulled on 23 September 2008.

2       Their child, a son, was born on XX XXX 2007. There were some custody battles between the parties in the US around 2010 but the Father’s guardianship application was eventually dismissed. The child is currently 13 years old and has primarily been under the Mother’s care since birth. The Mother decided to relocate with the child to Singapore sometime in 2015. The child is a foreigner studying in an International School in Singapore. At the time of the OSG application, both the Mother and the child have been residing in Singapore for at least 5 years.

3       The Father did not file any reply affidavits in this current application and the hearing took place without his attendance. I issued my orders and reasons in writing. A copy of the orders is annexed. The mother filed an appeal against my orders. I now elaborate on my reasons below.

## Custody, care and control and access arrangements for the child

### Custody, care and control of the child

4       The Mother sought an order for joint custody of the child. Even though she took the position that the Father displayed a lack of interest in the child’s upbringing, she recognised that the child will benefit from the guidance of both parents.[^1]

5       The Mother also sought sole care and control of the child. She argued that she has been the child’s primary caregiver since the child was born and would be the only parent who makes decision for the child in all aspects of his upbringing, including his physical needs, educational needs, character development, emotional needs, etc.[^2] In contrast, Father has been predominantly absent in the child’s upbringing and only saw the child twice a year during his summer and winter school breaks.[^3]

### Access arrangements for the child

6       The Mother proposed for the Father to have reasonable electronic access to the child as parties were residing in different countries.[^4] She was also agreeable for the Father to have access to the child twice a year (10 days in the child’s summer break and 1 week during the child’s winter break) as this was the arrangement that parties have consented to in January 2016. However, the Mother took the view that as the child was not old enough to travel alone, the Father ought to travel to Singapore to exercise his access with the child. The Mother is willing to accompany the child to Ohio to have access with the Father subject to the Father bearing hers and the child’s travel and accommodation expenses.[^5] The Mother has also requested for the Father to notify her within two hours should the child require any emergency medical care during access.[^6]

### The court’s decision

7       I am satisfied that it will be in the best of the child for parties to have joint custody over the child. The Mother shall also have sole care and control over the child. It is clear to me that the Mother is the primary caregiver since the birth of the child. The Father shall have reasonable access to the child, fund such access arrangements if applicable and notify the Mother within 2 hours of any emergency medical care concerning the child during his access. If parties cannot agree, the Father shall have access to the child up to 50% of the child’s school holidays subject to the child’s agreement. Parties are free to modify the access arrangements by consent. Each party may have electronic access to the child when the child is with the opposing parent.

## Maintenance for the child

### Child’s monthly expenses

8       The Mother furnished a list of the child’s monthly expenses in her affidavit and averred that the child’s expenses amounted to S$17,390.50 per month, as follows[^7]: -

9       Presently the Father pays about USD643 per month for the child and he has done so since 2009. Rounded off, this is about S$900. The Mother argued that this is insufficient and informed that the Father refused to pay more.[^8] As such, the Mother stated that in order to pay for the child’s expenses, she had to rely on her cash savings and her family’s largesse.[^9]

### Parties’ respective income

10     The Mother stated that she earns a monthly salary of about S$7,389 per month.[^10] The Mother asserts that the Father easily earns four times her monthly income in the region of USD20,000 to USD30,000. She also averred that the Father receives cash payments that are not taxed as he works at his family salons and consult of website developments for companies.[^11] Unfortunately, the Mother did not produce any supporting evidence to support her assertions. However, the Mother submitted that the Father was properly served with the OSG application but had consciously elected not to participate in these proceedings, and as such, the court should order reasonable maintenance as prayed for by her.[^12]

11     On this basis, the Mother submitted that since the Father earned at least four times of her salary, then it would be reasonable for the Father bear 4/5 share (80% share) of the child’s reasonable expenses, amounting to about S$14,000 per month (rounded up).[^13] In addition, the Mother asked that the Father reimbursed her 80% share of the child’s summer course fees within 7 days of notification with receipt and provide for the child’s medical expenses under the Father’s company insurance in their home country. For any other medical expenses which were not covered, she asked that the Father pays for 80% of such expenses.[^14]

12     The Mother also sought to backdate the maintenance sum of S$14,000 for a period of 3 years, with effect from 1 May 2017. She argued that it was not disputed that the Father had not been providing reasonable maintenance for the child and backdating of maintenance will vindicate the Father’s responsibility for the child’s needs and compensate the mother for the expenses that she has to bear on her own. The Mother submitted that the court had the discretion to backdate the maintenance and that it would not be detrimental to the Father to make such an order.[^15]

### The court’s decision

13     I was not persuaded that amount of maintenance requested by the Mother was reasonable. It was clearly not. The quantum was way above what the Mother received from her own income. I was also not persuaded that these were for the child’s essential living expenses.

14     Since birth, the Mother was the child’s primary caregiver. The Mother brought the child to Singapore when she relocated here for work several years ago. She is now working here and in another relationship. In other words, the Mother chose to raise the child in a foreign country. Hence, she would have to absorb the significantly higher costs of maintenance for the child. However, I can accept that the monthly maintenance expenses for an infant compared to a 13-year old child was different. Hence the Father’s monthly maintenance of USD643 was insufficient.

15     After review, I opined that it would be reasonable for the parents to spend about S$5,000 (including medical and dental expenses) on the child. In the absence of any independent evidence on the Father’s income, I opined that it would be fair to assume that the Father has about the same income level as the Mother. This worked out to be S$2,500 per parent and was about 35% of each of their gross income which was on the high side but still acceptable. I opined that S$5000 per month would be sufficient to cover the essential expenses of the child residing in Singapore as a foreigner. In addition, parties should co-pay any hospitalisation and related expenses for the child if this was not covered by the child’s insurance. The child’s essential expenses should include school fees as a foreigner, accommodation, transport and food. If the Mother wanted to opt for more expensive options or additional expenditures beyond the monthly maintenance amount, she would have to supplement from her own pocket. I ordered that the monthly maintenance commence on 1st December 2020 rather than three years ago as requested by the Mother since the Mother did not give any good reasons to explain why she only sought recourse presently.

## Costs

16     The Mother also submitted that I should order costs of S$5,000 against the Father if she succeeded. In my view, the key contention was the child maintenance. As the Mother only succeeded marginally, I ordered costs of S$1,000 against the Father.
