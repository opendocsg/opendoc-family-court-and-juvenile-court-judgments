Family Law – Variation - Consent Order – Custody Care & Control – Access

31 December 2019

### District Judge Azmin Jailani:

## Introduction

1       SUM 635/2019 (“SUM 635”) was an application by the defendant-father against the plaintiff-mother to vary various provisions of an interim judgment dated 4 February 2014 (the “IJ”). In particular, the defendant sought to vary the provisions which dealt specifically with the custody, care and control and access of the child of the marriage, RR.

2       The broad reliefs sought by the defendant in SUM 635 were as follows:

> (a)     First, that the defendant be granted sole care and control over RR, and consequentially, and that the existing provision under the IJ for child maintenance be removed (with the defendant maintaining RR solely), and that the plaintiff only be granted supervised access to RR.

> (b)     Second, and in the alternative, that the original order for “reasonable” access be removed and replaced with more expansive and definitive access terms; and

> (c)     Third, a penal notice be included.

The entirety of the prayers sought by the defendant is SUM 635 may be found at Annex A of this judgment.

3       In the same application, the defendant also sought certain interim orders on access pending the hearing of SUM 635. On this point, it was heartening to note that _during the course of the proceedings_, parties were able to arrive at some mutual arrangement regarding the defendant’s access to RR. The effect of this was that there was _no longer any necessity_ to deal with those interim prayers sought by the defendant. It was also heartening to note that parties’ respective counsels took on board this Court’s suggestion for them to go back to their clients, and consider a broader range of permutations regarding the defendant’s access to RR. This was with a view of narrowing the points of disputes between parties.

4       Parties’ counsels appeared before me on 3 May 2019, 24 May 2019, and 21 June 2019 to present their arguments. After considering the matter, I gave my decision on 11 July 2019, and provided brief reasons for the same. The entirety of my orders may also be found at Annex A at the end of this judgment. In essence:

> (a)     I declined to switch care and control from the plaintiff to the defendant. On that basis, I also declined the defendant’s consequential prayers that the plaintiff be granted supervised access to RR, or that the defendant was to maintain RR solely.

> (b)     Instead, I was more inclined to make more substantive and expansive revisions to the defendant’s access terms from the original provision of “reasonable” access under the IJ; and

> (c)     Lastly, I declined the defendant’s request to insert a penal notice.

5       Dissatisfied, the plaintiff filed HCF/DCA 87/2019 (“DCA 87”) appealing against _certain parts_ of my decision. For ease of reference, I have also highlighted in Annex A the specific orders the defendant was appealing against.

6       Against that backdrop, I now provide the full grounds of my decision.

## Parties and the terms of the IJ

9       Parties were married in 2005.

10     RR was born in April 2009. As at the date of the hearing, the child was 10 years old, and was in Primary 4.

11     The plaintiff filed the writ of divorce sometime in November 2003. IJ was granted, by consent, in February 2014. For the purposes of these proceedings, the following terms of the IJ relating to RR are relevant:

> 3.    Further Orders Made

>> By consent,

>> …

>> b.    That there be reasonable access to the Defendant

>> c.    That the Defendant shall pay the Plaintiff a sum of $1000 per month by the 1st week of each month upon parties obtaining the Certificate of Making Interim Judgment Final.

>> …

>> g.    That there be joint custody, with care and control of the child of the marriage, namely, \[RR\] to the Plaintiff.

12     For completeness, final judgment was entered on 7 May 2014.

## Background leading to the defendant’s application

13     Under the original IJ, the defendant was to transfer his interest in the matrimonial home to the plaintiff within 6 months from final judgment being entered.[^2] However, in July 2017, parties entered into a separate agreement whereby the matrimonial home would be sold in the open market instead.

14     This specific variation of the IJ was formalised via Order of Court ORC 3475/2017. Further to that variation, the matrimonial home was eventually sold later that same year.[^3]

15     After the sale of the matrimonial home, the defendant moved into a one-bedroom rental apartment[^4]. Thereafter, the defendant purchased a four-bedroom HDB flat in 2018. [^5]

16     As regards the plaintiff, after the matrimonial home was sold, she stayed with her current husband (who was her fiancé at that time) at her mother-in-law’s residence.[^6] The plaintiff purchased her own flat in late-2018.[^7]

### Child’s living arrangements prior to the plaintiff purchasing her own flat

17     What then was RR’s living arrangements up till the time the plaintiff was able to purchase her own flat? In this regard:

> (a)     Before the matrimonial home was sold (i.e., 2014 to 2017), and despite parties obtaining final judgment, it was not disputed that everyone was _still staying together in the matrimonial home_. Notably, given that parties were living under one roof, the defendant virtually had unfettered access to RR.

> (b)     After the matrimonial home was sold and _before_ the plaintiff had purchased her own HDB flat (i.e., when the plaintiff was living with her then fiancé and his mother), it is not disputed that RR was living with the defendant.[^8] During this time, there appeared to be a ‘routine’ where:[^9]

>> (i)       On days when the defendant took the _morning shift_, the plaintiff would be at the defendant’s residence early in the morning, get RR ready for school, and thereafter send her to school. After school RR would go to day care. The defendant would then pick RR from day care after completing his morning shift and take her to his house.

>> (ii)       On days when the defendant took the _night shift_, the plaintiff would similarly be at the defendant’s house early in the morning to prepare and send RR to school. After work, the plaintiff would pick RR up from day care and bring her back to the defendant’s house. The plaintiff would only leave the defendant’s residence at around 1am after the defendant returns from work. For completeness, the defendant contended that in these situations, the plaintiff would actually sleep over at the defendant’s residence till the next day to send RR to school the following day.

>> (iii)       On days when the defendant took the _afternoon shift_, the defendant would send RR to school. The plaintiff would pick RR from day care and bring her to the defendant’s residence. The plaintiff would leave once the defendant returned home.

### Child’s living arrangements after the plaintiff purchased her own flat

18     After the plaintiff purchased her own flat (i.e., around November 2018)[^10], the above arrangement appeared to have remained for a brief period. During that time, RR was having her school holidays.

19     However, sometime in December 2018, it was not in dispute that the defendant had ceased RR’s after-school day care and employed a domestic helper. The defendant’s position was that day care was terminated on the premise that RR was not happy in day care.[^11] In this regard, the plaintiff highlighted that the defendant’s decision to terminate day care was done without her permission.[^12] I would pause here and note that this specific contention was not substantively disputed, with the defendant simply stating that RR, being “very expressive and intelligent”[^13], highlighted how she “grew hating to go”[^14] to day care. On the other hand, the plaintiff highlighted how RR was exhibiting better habits as a result of day care.

20     Be that as it may, the plaintiff, somewhat grudgingly, took on board RR’s desire to try out the new arrangements of going home after school to a domestic helper instead of day care,[^15] and agreed to the same. However, given that the plaintiff now had her own place, the ‘revised’ arrangement was as follows:[^16]

> (a)     On weekdays, RR would be staying with her. The plaintiff would send RR to school. After school, the school bus would bring RR back to the defendant’s home, where she would be under the care of the domestic helper. The plaintiff would bring RR back to her place after she finished work.

> (b)     On Saturdays, the plaintiff would send RR to the defendant’s home after RR completed her dance class. RR would finish dance class around 2pm.

> (c)     On Sundays, the plaintiff would pick the child up at around 5:30pm.

### Issues with the domestic helper and escalation of tensions

21     It was the defendant’s position that after employing the domestic helper, the plaintiff began to complain about the helper, and wanted her employment to be terminated.[^17] For completeness, the defendant also highlighted that the plaintiff made some issues regarding the maintenance monies ordered under the IJ.

22     The plaintiff does not dispute the fact that she had reservations regarding the domestic helper.[^18] In this regard, RR had apparently conveyed to her that after completing her basis tasks, the domestic helper would be talking to her friends on her phone, leaving RR “bored and lonely”.[^19] When the plaintiff raised the above issues to the defendant, he did not agree that the helper was not discharging her responsibilities. The defendant highlighted that “so long as \[the domestic helper\] finishes work and takes care of \[RR\], the \[domestic helper\] can call home and talk over the phone.”[^20]

23     This underlying tension of parties’ perspectives over the care RR was receiving under the domestic helper culminated on 8 February 2019. On that day:

> (a)     It was not in dispute that there was an argument between the plaintiff and the domestic helper regarding the latter’s use of her phone.[^21] At the material time, the domestic helper, the plaintiff and RR were at the defendant’s home.

> (b)     It was also not in dispute that the argument escalated to the extent that the domestic helper left the home. The defendant’s narrative was that the plaintiff had chased her out the defendant’s home, claiming that it was her house,[^22] whilst the plaintiff’s position was that the helper stormed out of the house when the plaintiff called the defendant.[^23] In this connection, the defendant further asserted that it was RR who had called the defendant using the plaintiff’s phone, with the plaintiff subsequently snatching the phone from RR, who then proceeded to scream and argue with the defendant.

> (c)     On the defendant’s narrative, he subsequently called the helper and told her to go back to his house. The defendant further asserted that when the helper returned, the plaintiff had refused to open the door as she waited outside. Before the defendant returned home, the plaintiff had left with RR.

> (d)     More significantly, it was the defendant’s narrative that the plaintiff had ransacked the helper’s room and cupboard, threw things on the floor, and threw the food which the helper had cooked into the sink. In support of these contentions, the defendant annexed, _only his in second affidavit_, various photographs showing dishes in the sink and certain items on the floor of the helper’s room.[^24]

> (e)     While the plaintiff denies ransacking the helper’s room, her position was that:[^25]

>> Before I could hang up the phone, the maid dashed off from the Defendant’s flat although I told her to come back. As it was late and past the child’s dinner time, I had to return home but I did not have the key to lock the Defendant’s door. I told my child to pack her things and went to the maid’s cupboard to take the key to lock the Defendant’s door. After I had taken the cab to go home, the Defendant called me again to say that I had to wait for his maid to return home. As I was already on the way home, I refused.

24     After the 8 February 2019 incident above, it was the defendant’s position that he was only able to see RR on 20 February 2019 (i.e., 13 days).[^26] However, in his reply affidavit, the defendant acknowledged that RR was with him on 9 February 2019 and 10 February 2019 (i.e., the _following day_).[^27] In this regard, the plaintiff highlighted that she did hand RR over to the defendant on 9 February 2019 (a Saturday) as per the arrangement highlighted at \[20(b)\] above.

25     In short, the defendant did actually have access to RR, as per the revised arrangement, after the 8 February 2019 incident.

26     As per the above arrangement, the defendant was to return RR back to the plaintiff the next day (10 February 2019, a Sunday) at 5:30pm. However, it was not in dispute that on that day, the defendant returned RR late. Where parties differed was _how late_ the defendant returned RR.

27     Against that backdrop and the tensions regarding the domestic helper, RR continued to stay with the plaintiff during the weekdays (instead of sending RR to the defendant’s home to be cared for by the helper). More notably, the plaintiff did not hand RR over to the defendant for weekend access on 16 February 2019 (Saturday) and 23 February 2019 (Saturday).

28     For completeness, the plaintiff brought RR to the defendant’s home on 20 February 2019 for the purposes of obtaining RR’s passport. Given the clear tension by this time, parties’ evidence was consistent insofar as the police were involved were present at the defendant’s home to diffuse the situation.

29     The plaintiff commenced SUM 635 shortly after on 25 February 2019.

## Procedural background

30     I found it apposite to highlight certain developments after the defendant commenced SUM 635 up till the actual substantive hearing.

### 13 March 2019

31     At a case conference on 13 March 2019, it was specifically agreed, _by consent_, that pending the resolution of SUM 635, the defendant would have access to RR on Saturdays from 2pm to 6pm. For completeness, this was without prejudice to parties’ positions on the substantive matters at the hearing.

32     What was more important to highlight at this juncture was that by this time, parties had already agreed to an _interim arrangement pending the hearing/disposal of SUM 635_.

### 3 May 2019

33     At the hearing on 3 May 2019, and as evident from the documents submitted by parties, the plaintiff had, after the defendant’s reply affidavit (i.e., DA2), filed a further affidavit in response (i.e., PA2). It is not in dispute that PA2 was filed without the Court’s prior leave being sought, much less granted. Nevertheless, after considering the matter, I granted leave for PA2 to be admitted, but consequently directed the defendant to file a further reply affidavit limited to specific paragraphs of PA2.

34     I also highlighted to parties that given the fairly short period of time since the 8 February 2019 incident and when the defendant commenced SUM 635, as well as the defendant’s clear desire to see RR (or put another way, to have ‘access’ to her), I encouraged parties’ respective counsels to speak to their clients explore a more appropriate resolution for themselves and RR. I asked parties, particularly the plaintiff, to consider and propose other alternative access arrangements than those stated in the defendant’s summons.

### 24 May 2019

35     At the next hearing on 24 May 2019, it was brought to my attention that the defendant had, in his further reply affidavit (i.e., DA2), raised completely new matters outside the scope of my earlier directions. More pertinently, the defendant made supplementary statements regarding issues of family violence against RR, the involvement of child protective services, and the plaintiff’s purportedly unhygienic living conditions.[^28]

36     The defendant’s counsel, Ms Remya, noted that DA2 had gone outside the scope of my earlier directions, and highlighted that she had been instructed by the defendant to raise those matters. After considering the matter, I nevertheless allowed the plaintiff to reply to those new allegations. This was on the basis that those issues were, in my view, relevant insofar as it related to the defendant’s principal prayer of switching care and control of RR to him. Belated as they may be, the plaintiff ought to have the opportunity to respond to those fairly serious allegations. To have struck out the offending portions of DA2 would potentially throw the baby out with the bathwater.

37     Separately, and also further to my directions on 3 May 2019, the plaintiff had, by way of her solicitor’s letter dated 21 May 2019, submitted her proposal on access. This included access for the school holidays.[^29]

38     After speaking to parties, Ms Remya highlighted to me that the defendant was prepared to accept those proposals as interim access arrangements. Accordingly, I made additional interim access orders pending the submission of the plaintiff’s final affidavit and the next hearing. In addition to the interim access arrangements which was earlier agreed on 13 March 2019 (i.e., Saturdays 2pm to Sundays 6pm), the defendant had access to RR:

> (a)     starting from Fridays at 1:40pm; and

> (b)     during the upcoming June school holidays, from Friday, 31 May 2019 at 1:40pm to Sunday, 15 June 2019 at 7pm.

39     In short, parties had reached an agreement where the defendant would have _greater_ access to RR (i.e., from Friday to Sunday), and for half of the June school holidays.

## Parties’ arguments in brief

40     I now set out the main arguments raised by parties.

### Defendant’s arguments

41     To recap, the defendant’s primary prayer in SUM 635 was to _switch_ sole care and control from the plaintiff to himself.[^30] The defendant’s case is premised on the following bases:

> (a)     First, that parties’ circumstances, especially _before_ the plaintiff purchased her own flat, were such that RR was for all intents and purposes “under \[the defendant’s\] care and control”[^31]. In this regard, the defendant submitted that notwithstanding the terms of the IJ, the reality of the situation was that the defendant had _de facto_ care and control of RR.

> (b)     Second, the plaintiff’s act of restricting or limiting RR’s access, especially after the 8 February 2019 incident, constituted an act of alienation. Other acts of alienation include the defendant not being able to communicate with RR using the phone he had bought for her.

> (c)     Third, the plaintiff had failed to properly discharge her duties as the care parent, including threatening RR with a knife,[^32] making her wear clothing which would aggravate her eczema,[^33] placing RR in inhabitable living conditions (specifically bed-bugs)[^34], and physically stepping on RR’s face[^35]. Insofar as the defendant’s contentions relate to incidents of family violence, the defendant had apparently escalated these matters to child protective services.[^36]

42     I would pause here and note that while the defendant’s summons and affidavit was framed as a case to _switch_ care and control, in his written submissions,[^37] the defendant had, in my view, somewhat recalibrated his position to highlight, instead, an existing ‘shared care and control arrangement’ between parties at the material time.

43     In this regard, the defendant sought to highlight that parties had _equal time_ with RR. Notwithstanding this recalibration, the defendant maintained his position that there was no basis for the plaintiff to now rely on the terms of the IJ assert _sole_ care and control over RR. It simply was not the reality of parties’ circumstances.

44     As with the case on switching care and control, the defendant’s submission was that the 8 February 2019 incident dramatically changed the dynamics of the defendant’s time with RR. For completeness, the defendant suggested that the plaintiff’s underlying motivation was to get more money from him.[^38]

45     At the heart of either of the defendant’s cases was the submission that normalcy be restored, especially in terms of the defendant’s time with RR. Indeed, this was the thrust of the Ms Remya’s oral arguments at the hearing – that the arrangements which RR was experiencing (i.e., extensive time with the defendant) be restored, specifically for RR’s own welfare and benefit.

46     It was on that basis that the defendant highlighted that there should be a resumption of the ‘shared care and control arrangement’, or alternatively, liberal access terms which effectively mimicked the same.[^39] As regards these alternatively arrangements, these include the defendant having RR for half of each month (including overnight stay),[^40] as well as overseas access[^41].

### Plaintiff’s arguments

47     I turn now to the plaintiff’s arguments.

48     Insofar as the defendant sought to assert that he either had effective care control of RR, or that there was a shared care and control arrangement, the plaintiff did not dispute that _prior_ to purchasing her own property, RR was living with the defendant. Put another way, the plaintiff did not dispute the fact or extent of the defendant’s access (or interaction) with RR.

49     However, her position was that that was a _temporary arrangement_.[^42] It was not intended to be permanent in the sense that it amounted to a waiver or deviation from what was agreed to in the IJ, specifically that the plaintiff had _sole_ care and control of RR. In this regard, it was only after the plaintiff purchased her own place, and following the defendant’s unilateral decision to terminate RR’s day care and employ the helper, that she was in a position to properly give effect the original terms of the IJ.

50     Insofar as the defendant had levelled the numerous allegations against the plaintiff’s improper care of RR (see \[41(c)\] above), the plaintiff refuted those allegations. Unsurprisingly, given the nature of the allegations made by the defendant, the plaintiff herself took the opportunity to highlight that she had “alluded to \[the defendant’s\] affairs with other women, \[the defendant’s\] penchant for watching porn … and the regular harassment from loan shark runners”[^43] during the divorce proceedings.

51     Insofar as the defendant raised issues relating to RR’s safety, the plaintiff highlighted the lack of contemporaneous evidence. With regard to the alleged incident where the plaintiff had allegedly threatened RR with a knife, the plaintiff’s position was that this was not only unsubstantiated,[^44] but also refuted by RR herself when interviewed by the police.[^45] The plaintiff further highlighted the defendant’s penchant for exaggeration when he had initially alleged that he did not have access to RR for 13 days after the 8 February 2019 incident (see \[24\] above).

52     In summary, the plaintiff’s counsel, Mr Thamilselvan, sought to impress on me that the defendant’s application was borne more out of haste and anger and a failure to address the plaintiff’s concerns (i.e., the employment of the domestic helper), rather than any real issues relating to the welfare of RR. Mr Thamilselvan also sought to impress on me that there was no basis to allege that the plaintiff was alienating the defendant. On the contrary, and notwithstanding the plaintiff’s reservations, the plaintiff acceded to whatever the defendant had decided for RR (i.e., terminating day care, change of tuition, employing the helper), and has been fairly liberal with access. The only ‘restriction’ arose in light of the 8 February 2019 incident (which the plaintiff still handed RR to the defendant for weekend access the following day), and the defendant’s failure to return RR on time.

53     Additionally, following the commencement of SUM 635, and perhaps with the Court’s guidance, the plaintiff resumed access on agreed terms on 13 March 2019 (approximately 2 weeks after the defendant filed SUM 635). As highlighted earlier, the defendant’s access was further expanded at the hearing on 24 May 2019.

## Analysis and findings

54     Against the foregoing, I now provide by analysis and findings on the orders appealed against by the defendant.

### Prayer 1(1) – Interim access pending hearing/disposal of SUM 635

55     I first deal with Prayer 1(1). The entirety of the defendant’s prayer read as follows:

> (1)     _Pending the hearing of the variation application_, the Defendant shall have immediate access to the child, namely, RR, born on XX April 2009 (female)(hereinafter called “the child”). In the best interests of the child and for the safety and welfare, the child shall continue to live with the Defendant, father, at XXX, from there the child was removed.

> (emphasis added)

56     From a plain reading of the defendant’s own prayers, there can be no doubt that Prayer 1(1) was solely intended be an _interim prayer_ which would take effect _up to the hearing of the variation_ (i.e., before 3 May 2019). Notwithstanding the language used, I was prepared to go as far as to read the prayer as applying _up to the conclusion of the application_ (i.e., when my final orders were made). Once the substantive hearing started, or final orders were made (i.e., the matter was concluded), there would no longer be any necessity for this prayer to be dealt with.

57     It was precisely for the above reason that in light of my final determination of SUM 635, I made no order to Prayer 1(1). On that premise, it is unclear why the defendant was appealing against this particular decision.

58     Further, Prayer 1(1) was, in my view, rendered otiose in light of the agreements made at the case conference on 13 March 2019 (see \[31\] - \[32\] above). I would also point out that further interim access arrangements were made on 24 May 2019 (see \[37\] – \[39\] above). On that basis, interim arrangements _had in fact been made_ during the course of the proceedings. By the time I made my final orders, those orders would have superseded the arrangements made on 13 March 2019 and 24 May 2019.

59     If the defendant’s real complaint was that he was unhappy with the _quality_ of the interim arrangements at the relevant times they were made, it was open to the defendant to seek the necessary recourse _at that time_. In any case, I would highlight my reservations on such a challenge given that (a) the 13 March 2019 arrangements were made by consent, and (b) the 24 May 2019 arrangements were effectively premised on the plaintiff’s revised proposal, the substance of which was accepted by Ms Remya at that hearing.

### Prayer 1(2a) – Supervised access at DSSA

60     I next turn to Prayer 1(2a). The said prayer reads as follows:

> (2)(a)    \[Paragraph 3b of the IJ be varied such that\]: The Plaintiff shall have supervised access to the child at the DSSA. The access arrangements shall be subject to review. The Plaintiff shall undergo therapy and attend joint counselling sessions with the Defendant and the child as recommended by the DSSA.

61     There are several aspects to this prayer:

> (a)     First, that the plaintiff be entitled to supervised access to RR, and that such supervised access shall take place at the DSSA; and

> (b)     Second, that the plaintiff (as well as the defendant and RR) attending counselling sessions recommended by the DSSA.

62     As regards the first aspect, this prayer would be contingent on the defendant first being granted sole care and control of RR. Given that I was not inclined to grant the defendant’s prayer for regarding care and control, I consequently declined to grant the defendant’s prayer that the plaintiff have supervised access to RR.

63     Futhermore, any order for supervised access would depend on, _inter alia_, concerns of adverse reactions by the child with the visiting parent, and incidents of violence and abuse by the visiting parent (see _Law and Practice of Family Law in Singapore_, Foo Siew Fong gen ed, Sweet & Maxwell Asia, 2016 (“_Family Law in Singapore”_)(at \[10.4.40\]). Turning to the present case, there was no cogent material before me to suggest that RR had or was exhibiting such adverse reactions whilst with the plaintiff.

64     As regards the allegations of violence and abuse, I was similarly not convinced that the defendant had satisfactorily established that such violence took place. On the allegation that the plaintiff had threatened RR with a knife, the defendant’s own evidence was that RR had shared this alleged incident with her grandfather.[^46] In other words, the defendant neither personally witnessed the event, nor received direct information of the same from RR herself. Instead, the defendant escalated the matter by making a formal complaint and informing child protective services.

65     When the plaintiff highlighted what transpired during police investigations,[^47] the defendant sought to salvage his situation by merely stating why RR had lied to the police,[^48] and a recording which purportedly suggested that RR felt safer with the defendant. Whilst reference to such recording was made numerous times,[^49] it was not exhibited in _any_ of the defendant’s affidavit.

66     In summary, the defendant’s contentions were predicated on third-hand information without any persuasive evidence. Whilst I appreciated the defendant’s candour that he did not want to “blow up \[the\] issue in order to win this custody battle”[^50], it is unhelpful on one hand to level such serious allegations, and on the other hold back on relevant and crucial evidence which would be helpful for the court’s determination of the dispute.

67     For those reasons, I was of the view that the defendant had not made out its case that there were justifiable concerns of RR’s safety when she was with the plaintiff, much less make an order that the plaintiff be restricted to having supervised access with RR.

68     The second aspect of the defendant’s prayer relates to the plaintiff undergoing therapy at the DSSA. Related to the first aspect, this prayer was contingent on the defendant establishing that the plaintiff’s interaction with RR posed a sufficiently justifiable safety risk. Given my earlier findings, I similarly saw no basis for such orders to be made.

### Prayer 1(2b) – Sole care and control of RR

69     I now turn to the core contention in the SUM 635 – the defendant’s attempt to vary the existing care and control arrangement provided for in the IJ. To recap, in the IJ, it was _agreed_ that the plaintiff would have sole care and control of RR.

70     The law in terms of the variation of consent orders relating to the custody of children is not controversial. Sections 128 and 129 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353)(“WC”) gives this Court wide powers to vary any agreements relating to the custody and care and control of children. Section 129 WC goes as far as allowing this Court to go behind the terms of such an agreement so long as it is reasonable and in the child’s welfare to do so. And as with all decisions relating to the children, their welfare and interests are of paramount importance.

71     In the present case, the key question to be decided was whether parties’ circumstances were such that it would be in RR’s welfare to _alter_ the agreement made between parties under the IJ, and vest care and control to the defendant. The determination of this question, especially in light of parties’ fairly unique circumstances and ‘arrangements’, necessitated an examination of the _true state_ of parties’ arrangements were after IJ.

72     Put another way, did parties’ arrangements, in actuality, indicate a care and control arrangement _other than_ that provided in the IJ? In this regard:

> (a)     I first accepted Ms Remya’s argument that there can be no doubt that notwithstanding the terms of the IJ, the defendant, being the non-care parent, had been enjoying a somewhat unconventional amount of time with RR. As I mentioned earlier, the plaintiff herself acknowledged the time RR was able to spend with the defendant.

> (b)     However, I was not prepared to go as far as to accept the defendant’s contention that he was firstly, exercising some care and control over the child, and secondly, that this arose out of _a failure of the plaintiff properly exercising the same._

> (c)     In this regard, it was not the defendant’s case that before the matrimonial home was sold, the plaintiff was not tending to RR.

> (d)     After the matrimonial home was sold, I was first prepared to accept that the plaintiff’s acceptance of RR staying with the defendant was borne out of circumstance rather than an inability or lack of desire to care for RR. Indeed, in the defendant’s own evidence and submissions, the plaintiff was, depending on the defendant’s shift, tending to RR either in the early mornings getting ready and going to school, spending time with RR after school, or tending to RR in the defendant’s home till late hours, or a combination of either.

> (e)     To my mind, this indicated a situation where RR may have been physically living with the defendant because of the plaintiff’s circumstances, but that the plaintiff was heavily involved in the day to day raising of RR.

> (f)     I further accepted the plaintiff’s position that the arrangement after the matrimonial home was sold to the time the plaintiff was able to purchase her own place as being temporary in the sense that it did not indicate any waiver of the plaintiff’s position under the IJ. Indeed, if that were the situation, there was nothing preventing the defendant from seeking to formalise the same. Whilst I appreciated that formal proceedings may unnecessarily create tension between parties, it was sufficiently notable to me that no such attempts were made by the defendant to ‘regularise’ this arrangement. This is because to my mind, parties’ (and particularly the defendant) accepted that that arrangement was never meant to last indefinitely.

> (g)     Further, and insofar as the defendant had taken the lead in choosing to terminate RR’s day care and employ the domestic helper, I was of the view that this had more to do with the defendant unilaterally making a decision for RR, as opposed to an illustration of him having _de facto_ care and control.

73     After considering the matter, I was more inclined to answer the question at \[72\] above in the negative. Instead, I was more inclined to find that the various arrangements indicate the defendant _having a lot of access with RR_. This, in my view, was _actually consistent_ with the terms of the IJ where the defendant had “reasonable access” (or rather, liberal access) to RR.

74     I would pause here and make the supplementary observation that parties’ arrangement was unconventional, and did not really allow for the agreements made in the IJ to properly take its course. For instance, the IJ anticipated the matrimonial home being sold to the Plaintiff. However, this could not be done, and parties were conducting themselves in a manner inconsistent with what the IJ originally envisaged, especially in terms of the care arrangements for RR.

75     To be clear, this did not render the agreement to custody unworkable _per se_, but rather, _held it in abeyance_ pending parties sorting out their own accommodation.

76     Again, what did all this mean to RR?

77     In this regard, I accepted Ms Remya’s point that it was important for me to understand RR’s situation because, as pointed out by the High Court in _ABW v ABV_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 769</span> (at \[20\]), stability and continuity of living arrangement was an important factor to the welfare of a child.

78     After considering the matter, I was of the view that RR had the enviable benefit of being able to see _both_ her parents extensively. This is despite the status of her parent’s relationship. However, as I mentioned earlier, there was nothing before me to satisfactorily indicate that the defendant was tending to RR _as a result of the plaintiff’s failure or absence to properly care for RR_. On that basis. there was nothing before me to indicate a course of conduct _which significantly departed_ from what the IJ provided.

79     For those reasons, I was still of the view that care and control was still vested with the plaintiff.

80     The next question was whether the circumstances justified changing this position.

81     I first start with switching care and control. In _ABW_ (at \[27\]), the Court held that switching care and control would be appropriate if there was any deliberate or unconscious interference with the bond between the child and the non-parent. Without being prescriptive, other factors include:

> (a)     Acts of family violence (see _TOQ v TOR_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGFC 67</span> (at \[18\]); and

> (b)     Negative treatment of children (see _TOQ_ at \[18\])

82     I pause here and note that in his submissions, the defendant had invited this Court to call for a custody evaluation report as an aid in determining this case.[^51] This was, in my view, clearly predicated on the vast allegations made by the defendant regarding the standard of the plaintiff’s care towards RR, as well as her safety.

83     At the outset, I would accept that a custody evaluation report forms one of the various tools available to this Court to assist it in its deliberations as to the welfare of a child. This is especially so when the contentions raised relate to a child’s living conditions and emotional/psychological wellbeing. That said, I was of the view that the commission of such reports cannot be intended to assist a parties’ case in the absence of sufficient evidence. It would still be incumbent on any applicant to be able to sufficiently satisfy their own case on the materials already before them. To my mind, commissioning such reports based on an improperly premised suspicion or fear would devalue such reports as being an alternative means of fishing or evidence collection.

84     What was more concerning was that ultimately, the children would suffer the most through multiple interviews and assessments be the relevant experts and/or specialists.

85     Turning to the present case, and after assessing parties’ evidence and submissions, I was not convinced that any of the defendant’s contentions warranted this Court to switch care and control arrangements agreed upon in the IJ:

> (a)     First, I was not convinced that the 8 February 2019 incident was solely attributable to the plaintiff. Whilst I would record my uneasiness by the manner in which the plaintiff acted with the helper, there was no evidence showing that the plaintiff was the aggressor in that situation. What was also notably absent was any statement by the helper confirming either party’s narrative (or at the very least the defendant’s).

> (b)     In the defendant’s own affidavit[^52], he stated that he had called the helper on her handphone and told her to go back to the defendant’s home. If it was true that (i) the plaintiff had actively prevented the helper from coming into the home, or (ii) that the plaintiff had ransacked the premises, there would have been little difficulty by the helper to obtain contemporaneous evidence to that effect.

> (c)     Second, I did not accept the fact and/or extent of the defendant’s characterisation of the plaintiff alienating RR from him. At the outset, I had reservations with the defendant’s overstatement that he had not seen RR since the 8 February 2019 event. I also had reservations with the defendant somewhat deflecting the issue that he had returned RR late on 10 February 2019.

> (d)     Insofar as it was not dispute that the defendant did not have access to RR for two weekends (i.e., 16 February 2019 and 23 February 2019), I was of the view that this was to a lesser or greater extent unexceptional in family proceedings involving children. The plaintiff’s behaviour, although somewhat disproportionate given the circumstances, did not indicate to me any justifiable suspicion of gatekeeping. Indeed, once proceedings commenced and after allowing parties some space to calm down and reflect, the plaintiff did resume access arrangements.

> (e)     Third, for the reasons I stated above, I was not convinced that the plaintiff had exhibited any violent behaviour towards RR (i.e. the knife threatening incident, or the allegation that the plaintiff had stepped on RR’s face).

> (f)     Fourth, I was also not convinced that there were genuine hygiene issues with the plaintiff’s home.

86     For the above reasons, I was of the view that the defendant had not established any sufficient malevolence on the plaintiff’s part which warranted care and control to be transferred over to him.

#### Shared care and control

87     I now turn to the defendant’s recalibrated position in his submissions – the case for _shared_ care and control. In this regard, the High Court in _TAU v TAT_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 1089</span> made the following important observations regarding this concept of shared care and control:

> (a)     The notion of shared care and control meant that the child effectively had two homes and two primary care givers (_TAU_ at \[11\]).

> (b)     In considering whether such orders can be made, the Court will have to consider factors such as the child’s needs at a particular stage of life, the extent to which parents are able to co-operate within such an arrangement, and whether it was easy for the child to effectively live in two homes (_TAU_ at \[12\]).

88     I would supplement this further by stating that:

> (a)     the notion of shared care and control is sometimes confused with shared and equal parenting. In that context, and as cautioned in _TAU_ (at \[10\]), parties sometimes miss the forest from the trees, and treat these concepts as “instruments of control” a party has over the child and the other parent. In such cases, the focus is not so much on the child’s welfare, but rather, a self-serving indicia of their status with the child; and

> (b)     the notion of shared care and control, at its very core, demands a level of cooperation and civility which is closest (and to some extent surpasses) to when parties were together. In fact, in _Elements of Family Law in Singapore_ (Leong Wai Kum, LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2013)(at page 338), the author opined that such orders require “a unique set of conditions” before this Court may be satisfied that it would be in the welfare of the child to under two separate and distinct households.

89     Turning to the present case, I was not convinced that the defendant was able to establish the kind of “unique circumstances” akin to a shared care and control environment:

> (a)     Before the matrimonial home was sold, I was of the view that it _was not_ a situation of shared care and control as understood in _TAU_. Just because both parties were in the same home as RR does not amount to shared care and control.

> (b)     Similarly, under the revised arrangement after the plaintiff bought her own flat (see \[20\] above), it was not a situation where RR was ‘living in two homes with two primary care givers’. During the time RR was at the defendant’s home, the domestic helper was tending to RR. The defendant essentially had time with RR during the weekends. This, in my view, was far removed from the conventional situation of shared care and control.

> (c)     With regard to the level of cooperation and civility, it suffices to state from the nature of the allegations made that there is sufficient residual animosity between parties. Additionally, I took the view that the defendant’s effectively unilateral decision to terminate day care and employ the helper shed light on how he viewed his relationship with the plaintiff.

> (d)     Throughout the defendant’s evidence and submissions, his focus on ‘shared care and control’ was predicated more on him having _equal time_ RR, as opposed to exhibiting the ‘unique’ scenario of co-operation required before such an order is made.

> (e)     In terms of RR’s welfare and needs, I was also of the view that given her relatively young age, it would not be in her best interests for her to experience living in two different homes with two heads who, in my view, clearly have not achieved the level of co-operation necessary for shared care and control. To my mind, it was more appropriate for RR to (i) have stability in recognising that there was a ‘base’ for her, and (ii) slowly be accustomed to the proper arrangements _agreed under the IJ_.

90     For those reasons, I was not inclined to grant the prayers sought by defendant regarding care and control.

### Prayer 1(2c) – Defendant’s application to maintain RR solely

91     Prayer 1(2c) reads as follows:

> 1(2)(c):    \[That paragraph 3(c) IJ be varied such that\] The Defendant shall maintain the child solely. The Defendant shall be allowed to continue paying for the child’s expenses without having to pay any additional maintenance sum to the Plaintiff, if care and control is given to the Plaintiff.

92     In light of my findings on care and control, I was not inclined to make any changes in relation to the maintenance orders agreed upon by parties under the IJ.

### Orders relating to access appealed by the Defendant

93     As I mentioned earlier, I was of the view that the defendant’s application had less to do with the notion of care and control, but rather, the defendant’s ability to spend time with the RR. Indeed, the constant theme in the defendant’s evidence was that he wanted normalcy to return insofar as he had very liberal access to RR.

94     In the early stages, this was not really an issue. However, this was not a true reflection of parties’ circumstances because the matrimonial home had yet to be sold. The actual mechanics of the IJ was only able to properly take into effect _after_ the matrimonial home was sold.

95     I was of the view that the better approach was to give more expansive and definitive parameters as to the defendant’s access to RR. As I mentioned earlier, it was appropriate for RR to have some structure in terms of where her ‘home base’ was, but at the same time create a situation where RR would have as much time as possible with the defendant.

96     Lastly, given some of the allegations raised by parties, I was of the view that it would be beneficial to _both_ parties that more defined terms of access be put in place. This is to prevent any misunderstandings or unnecessary escalations in the future.

97     Against that backdrop, I now turn to the specific access orders which the defendant has appealed against.

#### (1)   Weekday Access

98     In my final orders, I granted the defendant one day of weekday access per week. In his prayers, the defendant sought “2 weeks of weekdays with each parent and all weekends with the Defendant including overnight access”.

99     At the outset, it was apposite to highlight that the nett effect of the defendant’s prayers would mean that the plaintiff would actually have less than half a month with RR. Insofar as the defendant sought to extol some shared care and control arrangement, this was completely incongruous with the prayers he sought.

100    In any case, I was of the view that having such extensive weekday access was not appropriate for the child. There was nothing in the defendant’s evidence of his ability to make meaningful use of such access if it were granted to him. In the defendant’s own evidence, he was working shift work. There was no evidence on how the defendant would maximise the time he had with her whilst balancing his work commitments. It was more likely, given that RR was not in day care, that she would just be at home under the care of the domestic helper. I had my reservations as to whether this would be a suitable arrangement for RR.

101    I was of the view that it would be better for both RR and the defendant if there was a pre-determined weekday in which access could take place. This would allow sufficient certainty for the defendant to organise his work commitments, and be able to spend the entire time with RR.

#### (2)   Overseas Access

102    In his application, the defendant sought for “overseas access during school holidays”.

103    A review of my final orders will show that I _did grant_ the defendant such access. For ease of reference, the entirety of my orders relating to school holiday and overseas access is reproduced here:

> iii. Long school holiday access (June)

> a.    Every odd year, the Defendant shall have access to the Child for the first half of the June Holidays.

> b.    Every even year, the Defendant shall have access to the Child for the second half of the June Holidays

> iv. Long school holiday access (December)

> a.    Every odd year, the Defendant shall have access to the Child for the first half of the December Holidays.

> b.    Every even year, the Defendant shall have access to the Child for the second half of the December Holidays

> v. Short school holiday access (March and September)

> a.    Every odd year, the Defendant shall have access to the Child during March holidays.

> b.    Every even year, the Defendant shall have access to the Child during September Holidays

> vi. Overseas access

> a.    For any of the school holidays stated above, the Defendant may bring the Child overseas.

> b.    The Defendant is to provide the Plaintiff with the itinerary and relevant contact details of the trip (including but not limited to travel agency and accommodation location) no less than 4 weeks before departure.

> c.    The Plaintiff is to provide the Defendant with the Child’s passport no less than 1 week before departure. The Defendant is to return the Child’s passport to the Plaintiff within 1 week after arrival.

> d.    During overseas travel, the Plaintiff shall be entitled to speak with the Child (either by voice call or video call) at the end of each day for up to ½ hour, or such time which the Child can reasonably maintain the conversation for.

104    Curiously, in my view, the defendant appealed against the following condition of overseas travel:

> b.    The Defendant is to provide the Plaintiff with the itinerary and relevant contact details of the trip (including but not limited to travel agency and accommodation location) no less than 4 weeks before departure.

105    I was of the view that it was well within reasonable norms for the defendant to provide the plaintiff with 4-week (i.e. approx. 1 month) notice of the details of his trip with RR. This is especially so given that for overseas trips during the peak period holiday season, advance preparations would be done by any reasonable parent.

106    To the extent that it may be inferred that the defendant _did not_ wish to have such information disclosed, this would be highly unusual, and in any event without merit.

#### (3)   Birthday Access

107    In his application, the defendant prayed that “Birthday access will be shared”.

108    The orders I made in relation to birthday access is as follows:

> vii Birthday access

> a.    For every odd year, the Defendant shall have access to the Child from 10am to 3:30pm.

> b.    For every even year, the Defendant shall have access to the Child from 3pm to 8:30pm.

109    Save that I considered it appropriate to give clarity to my orders, I had, once again, effectively granted the defendant’s prayer that both parents have practically equal time with RR on her birthday, with each parent alternating between the mornings and afternoons of each birthday.

110    It is unclear the nature of the defendant’s dissatisfaction with these orders given that they effectively what he sought for. If the defendant’s intention was to split the day down the middle (i.e. 12 hours each), I considered that to be both impractical, but more disappointingly, further insight as to the defendant’s underlying motives.

#### (4)   Telephone / Video access when RR is not with the Defendant

111    In this application, the defendant prayed that he would “purchase an analogue phone for \[RR\] to talk to her daily for 30 to 40 minutes”.

112    My eventual orders on telephone access were as follows:

> c.    On days when the Defendant does not have access to the Child, the Defendant shall be entitled to speak with the Child (either through voice call or video call) for up to ½ hour, or such time which the Child can reasonably maintain the conversation for. The Defendant shall be responsible for purchasing an appropriate phone (with an appropriate plan to allow for such calls.

113    Yet again, save that I added certain language to give clarity to my orders, I had effectively given what the defendant sought. At the risk of repeating myself _ad nauseum_, it was again unclear as to the nature of the defendant’s dissatisfaction of my orders which was, in essence, the very relief he prayed for (albeit in the alternative as he sought sole care and control).

### Prayer 2 – Penal Notice

114    After considering the matter, I was not inclined to include a penal notice into my orders. As highlighted by the High Court in _UNE v UNF_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHCF 15</span> (at \[15\]), _all court orders_ must be complied with. That is the legitimate expectation of every party who enters into our system and receives the court’s determination.

115    Insofar as it can be discerned that the defendant’s intention to insert a penal notice was to be a procedural preamble before commencing committal proceedings, I found this to be wholly unnecessary. This is because, for the reasons I highlighted above, I was not satisfied that the plaintiff was in flagrant breach of any other the prior arrangements or agreements which necessitated such a notice being included. For completeness, I would reiterate my earlier observations that perhaps with the benefit of hindsight, the plaintiff would similarly do well not to act too hastily in the future.

116    Accordingly, I declined to make any other for the inclusion of a penal notice.

### Prayer 3 – Costs

117    After considering parties’ submissions, I accepted Ms Remya’s submission and made no order as to costs. Once again, this was another order which, when viewed in its totality, was in the defendant’s favour.

## Conclusion

118    For the reasons I provided above, I made the orders found in Annex A below. It leaves me to thank Mr Thamilselvan and Ms Remya for assisting the Court with their submissions.
