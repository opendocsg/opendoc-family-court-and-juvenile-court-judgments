Family Law – Matrimonial law – Women’s Charter – Dissolution of marriage – Divorce – Unreasonable behaviour – Separation

21 May 2020

### District Judge Sheik Mustafa:

## Introduction

1       I shall refer to the Plaintiff as “the Husband”, and to the Defendant as “the Wife”.

2       The Husband had filed a writ for divorce on the ground that the Wife had behaved in such a way that he cannot reasonably be expected to live with her, and on the ground that they have lived apart for a continuous period of at least 4 years immediately preceding the filing of the writ. The Wife contests this.

3       I heard the oral testimony of both the Husband, and of the Wife, at the trial. Counsel assigned by the Legal Aid Bureau represented the Husband. The Wife represented herself. After hearing both sides, I decreed the marriage dissolved, and that the Wife shall pay costs to the Director of Legal Aid. I adjourned the ancillary matters, to be heard separately.

4       The Wife appeals against my judgment. The following are the reasons for my judgment.

## Background facts

5       The Husband is now 70 years old, and the Wife is 67 years old. They had married 45 years ago, in May 1975, in Singapore. They are both Singapore citizens.

6       At the time of marriage, the Husband was a schoolteacher. The Husband remained a teacher for 38 years until his retirement in 2004. The Wife ceased to work as a seamstress just before the marriage. Thereafter she was a home maker.

7       Their marriage yielded 3 children – a daughter and 2 sons, in that order. They are presently all adults, aged between 44, 41 and 38 years old.

8       The couple obtained an HDB flat, then a HUDC flat, then an antebellum terrace house, and finally a two-storey terrace house, which I shall refer to as “the matrimonial home”.

## The Husband’s case

9       The Husband paints a picture of a marital storm that began in 1997. Somewhere then, the Wife woke up one day and told him that her late mother had appeared to her in dreams, telling her to be kind to cats. Doing so would save her from perdition. She resolved that her only way to salvation was to be kind to cats and looking after them. She believed that this would enable her to not only cross into Paradise, but also protect her family.

10     The Wife developed an obsession with cats. She went around feeding stray cats. Their youngest son brought home a kitten. From then on, the Wife began to collect stray cats and adopted them into the matrimonial home.

11     This feline collection created quite a nuisance. The cats roamed the home freely. They were not toilet trained, and would urinate and defecate indiscriminately. There was a stench of cat faeces and urine emanating from the matrimonial home, which led to numerous complaints by neighbours. The police and other authorities turned up and warned the Wife. Nevertheless, she did not cease her feline collection.

12     The Husband claims that he pressed the Wife to send the cats for re-homing elsewhere, but the Wife was adamant not to do so. The Husband could no longer bear to sleep on the marital bed, as it was constantly defiled. To maintain some semblance of hygiene for himself, he slept on a mat on the floor instead. However by 2003, he could not tolerate it any more and called the police on his own wife. He showed the police the condition he was living in, but the officers responded that it was a domestic issue, and left it at that. The Wife progressively became more hostile and irritable. The Husband put it down to menopause and avoided her as much as possible.

13     The Husband retired in 2004, and was to receive a pension of $500,000. He used a portion of it to settle the outstanding mortgage on the home. The rest was deposited into 5 joint accounts suggested by the Wife. Sometime in 2005, the Husband went to check on the accounts. He was surprised to discover that there were only 2 accounts to his name. He immediately closed the 2 accounts and moved the $100,000 from there into a new account in his sole name.

14     The Husband confronted the Wife about the missing funds. The Wife responded to the effect that she had taken the money. They kept quarrelling, and their already bad relationship became worse.

15     In 2006, one of the Wife’s cats urinated on the Husband whilst he was sleeping. It was the last straw. After a bout of arguments, the Husband left the matrimonial home, to live with his brother-in-law. He has not returned since then. He claims that on at least 2 occasions when he tried to go home but was chased away by the Wife. The last occasion he went to the matrimonial home was on Chinese New Year Eve in 2007, but was not able to enter as no one was in. Ever since then, the parties have not lived together and ceased to have contact with each other altogether. He was kept estranged from his children by the Wife, so much so that he has no clue on what has happened to them. Even when one of the sons was in ICU at the hospital, the Wife prevented him from visiting.

16     The Husband adduces a newspaper report showing that their daughter was fined in the State Courts in YYYY[^1] for not paying wages to her domestic worker for more than a year, and for putting her to work at an unauthorised location, which was a house in Johor Bahru. It reported that the domestic worker had been employed to look after the Wife at the matrimonial home. The report also stated that the Wife had tasked the domestic worker to look after the cats both in the matrimonial home as well as in a rented house in Johor Bahru. It went on to state that the Wife alleged that the domestic worker killed off 40 of the cats, and that the Wife sued the employment agency for this loss.

17     The Husband also adduces an online report by from YYYY[^2], purporting to show that the Wife had been employing domestic workers since the time he left the matrimonial home. He also adduced another online article posted on Junk Asia allegedly posted by the Wife herself, which contained a letter to the Prime Minister’s Office, the High Court and the Attorney-General’s Chambers. In it, she stated that she was a bankrupt because she was ordered to pay costs for the legal proceedings.

18     By these articles, the Husband submits they show the motive why the Wife contests the divorce application, in that she wishes to retain the matrimonial home in order to avoid accounting to the Official Assignee on her share of it.

## The Wife’s Case

19     The Wife puts forth a defence, but no counterclaim. She discharged her lawyers halfway through the course of the case, filed her own affidavit of evidence-in-chief, and advocated on her own behalf at the hearing.

20     The Wife chronicles a litany of ails that she suffered at the hands of the Husband. They are numerous and detailed, but because she is not claiming for a dissolution of the marriage based on any of them, I find them to be irrelevant. I will instead focus on her evidence that relates to the Husband’s claims.

21     The Wife confirms that she did indeed withdraw a large amount of money from the joint account savings of the Husband’s retirement. In fact, she says that she is grateful to the bank staff who told her to withdraw $200,000 from it. She used the money to buy a car for her younger son, to buy a van, and for other things as well. She candidly confirms that she did not inform the Husband, nor did she obtain his consent, prior to the withdrawal. She attempts to justify this by saying that the Husband had spent $165,000 of funds from his sole account for himself.

22     The Wife keeps many cats at home. She does not confirm or deny the specific incident leading to the Husband’s departure. The authorities took action against her, and it led to her bankruptcy due to her debt to the Attorney-General. She blames the Husband for this.

23     She confirms that the Husband had left home “more than 10 years ago”, although she emphasises that he was not forced to do so.

## Issues

24     The issues of the case to be decided by the Court are as follows –

> a.     Did the Wife behave as alleged by the Husband?

> b.     If so, is this a behaviour that the Husband cannot reasonably be expected to live with her?

> c.     Did the parties live separately and apart for more than 4 years before the presentation of the writ?

> d.     Is there a possibility of reconciliation between them?

## Applicable Legal Principles

### Unreasonable behaviour

25     In the Women’s Charter, section 95 (3) states that

> “the Court hearing any proceedings for divorce shall not hold a marriage to have broken down irretrievably unless the plaintiff satisfies the court of one of more of the following fact: …

>> (b)    that the defendant has behaved in such a way that the plaintiff cannot reasonably be expected to live with the defendant”.

26     In _Teo Hoon Ping v Tan Lay Ying Angeline[^3]_, the High Court stated as follows –

> “The test for determining whether a spouse has behaved in such a way that the spouse cannot reasonably be expected to live with him or her was laid down in the case of Wong Siew Boey v Lee Boon Fatt. This test requires the court to ask if the plaintiff, with his or her characteristics and personality, with his or her faults and other attributed, good and bad, and having regard to his or her behaviour during the marriage, can reasonably be expected to live with the defendant.

> The test as stated is an objective one that requires the court to take into account the subjective qualities of the plaintiff. There appears to be no local case that has directly addressed the issue of whether the reasons for the defendant having acted as he did should be a factor in determining the reasonableness of his behaviour.

> Both a literal reading of s 95(3)(b) of the Women’s Charter as well as the test in _Wong Siew Boey_ suggest that the focus of the analysis should be on whether the defendant’s behaviour was so unreasonable that the union has become impossible, rather than on any consideration of blameworthiness. Although it is common to describe s95(3)(b) as allowing for the dissolution of marriage due to unreasonable behaviour, this is a misnomer. Section 95(3)(b) deals only with behaviour that is sufficiently grave for the court to conclude that one party cannot reasonably be expected to live with the other. Hence, the reasons for the defendant’s behaviour are secondary to the question of whether it is reasonable to expect a plaintiff to continue living with him or her.”

27     What constitutes behaviour that a spouse cannot reasonably be expected to live with is a matter of fact that depends on the circumstances of each particular case. This was stated by the High Court in Wong Siew Boey v Lee Boon Fatt[^4]. What I need to consider is whether or not the behaviour of the Wife is such that the Husband cannot reasonably be expected to live with, as a finding of fact, without categorising such behaviour as blameworthy or guilty; that the cumulative effect of the behaviour of the Husband can be considered, and the behaviour is not confined to behaviour towards the wife, but can include behaviour towards other members of the family or outsiders so long as it has reference to the marriage.

### Separation

28     In the Women’s Charter, section 95 (3) states that

> “the Court hearing any proceedings for divorce shall not hold a marriage to have broken down irretrievably unless the plaintiff satisfies the court of one of more of the following fact …

>> (e)    that the parties to the marriage have lived apart for a continuous period of at least 4 years immediately preceding the filing of the writ.”

29     The case of _Tan Lee Tian v Chia Thuan Hwa_[^5] provides a guide on what constitutes separation. In that case, the High Court found that there is both an objective and a subjective standard. The subjective standard required the Court to consider the content of the marital relationship of each couple. The objective standard required the Court to consider whether it is just and reasonable in all the circumstances and whether it would be wrong to dissolve the marriage. The fact of living apart is crucial where the parties rely on having lived apart for three or four years. It is ultimately a question of fact and degree and it is for a judge looking at all the variable components, some present, some absent, to find as a fact whether there has been a “living apart”.

30     In _Leong Kwek Keong v. Lee Ying Kuan_[^6] , the High Court held that separation could occur even where only one spouse formed the intention to sever or not to resume the marital relationship and acted on that intention, or alternatively acted as if the marital relationship had been severed. Chan J also referred to _Santos v Santos[^7]_, where the Court of Appeal held that one party alone could bring about a separation or living apart if he intended it to be or if his attitude of mind was so, and further, this unilateral element need not be communicated to the other party. The problem was one of proof in cases where the court has to decide whether the relevant party had such an intention, and this would require careful examination by the first instance judge and special caution may need to be taken.

31     In short, for the Husband to succeed in this regard, he must prove that he and the Wife have not only lived separately, which is a question of fact, and also that there was an accompanying _mens rea_ on his part treating the marriage as having been severed.

## Did the Wife behave as alleged by the Husband?

32     I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Wife did so. I list out each of the behaviours complained of by the Husband.

### The Wife withdrew half of the Husband’s retirement savings without his knowledge or consent

33     The Wife does not dispute that she withdrew $200,000 from the joint account. She believed that she was entitled to the money because she had consulted a lawyer who had advised her that if she were to divorce the Husband she would be entitled to half of his CPF. She withdrew this very substantial amount of the Husband’s savings, without his knowledge or consent.

### The Wife’s had created an unsanitary living environment

34     The Wife does not challenge that she kept a large number of cats at the home. She does not admit or deny the alleged facts leading to the Husband being urinated upon by a cat, but I accept the Husband’s version that it took place. The Wife knew the Husband objected to the conditions of their home. In fact, she is upset with him for calling the police about it.

35     I place no reliance on the media and newspaper articles adduced by the Husband. They describe facts not to his personal knowledge, and these facts took place after he had left the matrimonial home. In themselves, they do not prove or corroborate the reason why he left the home, which is the only cogent issue on this case.

## Are these behaviour that the Husband cannot reasonably be expected to live with the Wife?

36     I apply the test prescribed by the case of _Wong Siew Boey v Lee Boon Fatt_[^8], and I find that the behaviour is of such a nature that the Husband cannot be reasonably expected to live with the Wife.

## Did the parties live separately and apart for more than 4 years before the presentation of the writ?

37     The Wife does not dispute that the Husband left the matrimonial home in 2006 (15 years before the filing of the writ), and never resumed cohabitation or contact at all since then.

## Is there a possibility of reconciliation between the parties?

38     Having found that the marriage has broken down due to unreasonable behaviour and due to separation, I now examine whether, in spite of them, there is a possibility of reconciliation. Section 49 of the Women’s Charter provides that -

> (1)    A court before which —

>> (a)    proceedings for divorce or judicial separation;

>> (b)    proceedings, instituted by a party to a subsisting marriage, under section 59, 65, 66 or 69,

> are being heard shall consider, from time to time, the possibility of a reconciliation of the parties.

> (2)    If, during such proceedings, it appears to the judge from the nature of the case, the evidence in the proceedings or the attitude of the parties that there is a reasonable possibility of a reconciliation of the parties, the judge may do all or any of the following:

>> (a)    adjourn the proceedings to give the parties the opportunity to consider a reconciliation or to enable anything to be done in accordance with paragraph (b) or (c);

>> (b)    with the consent of the parties, interview them in chambers, with or without their solicitors, as the judge thinks proper, to assist in a possible reconciliation; and

>> (c)    nominate a Conciliation Officer or some other suitable person or organisation to assist in considering a possible reconciliation.

39     I considered the possibility of reconciliation. I find that there is none. The parties’ attitudes are utterly not compromising; the Husband is insistent on ending the marriage, and the Wife is in vehement refusal to end the marriage. The couple have been consciously estranged from each other for 15 years. That is a long period of time by any measure. There is no ember of love or affection left to rekindle.

## Conclusion

40     Under the Women’s Charter, Section 95(2) states -

> “The court hearing such proceedings shall, so far as it reasonably can, inquire into the facts alleged as causing or leading to the breakdown of the marriage and, if satisfied that the circumstances make it just and reasonable to do so, grant a judgment for its dissolution.”

41     Based on the foregoing, on a balance of probabilities, the Husband has proved his case. The marriage between the parties has broken down irretrievably due to the behaviour of the Wife, and due to 4 years of separation. There is no possibility of reconciliation. There are no minor children. For these reasons, it is just and reasonable to grant a judgment to dissolve the marriage.

## Costs

42     The Husband is legally aided, and prayed for an order of costs. The Wife’s case did not disclose any defence to the Husband’s claim. The facts she adduced do not in any way dispute his case. The Wife expressed that she did not agree to a divorce not because she wanted to save the marital relationship, but she does not want a division of the matrimonial home. The contested trial was unnecessary. I ordered the Wife to pay $3,000 to the Director of Legal Aid.
