Access to child

4 March 2019

### District Judge Nicole Loh:

1       This was an application for access filed by the father of a 2 year old child. Parties were married on xx xxx 2015 with a child born on xx xxx 2016. Parties separated on 3 March 2018 and the Husband complained that after 2 May 2018, he had difficulties in having access to the child and therefore filed the application in November 2018.

## Orders Made

2       After hearing both parties, I allowed the Husband to have access to the child as follows:

(a)     5pm to 8pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The Husband, his sister or Husband’s father to fetch the child from the childcare she attends and to return her to the Wife’s residence;

(b)     10am to 8pm on Saturdays. The Husband, his sister or Husband’s father to pick up from and return the child to the Wife’s residence; and

(c)     Husband is not to bring the child back to the matrimonial flat during access.

## Appeal

3       The Wife has appealed against the entire order.

## Undisputed facts

4       The following events are undisputed: -

(a)     xx xxx 2016: Child was born.

(b)     13 June 2017: Wife and Child moved out of the matrimonial home.

(c)     10 December 2017: Wife and Child moved back to the matrimonial home.

(d)     3 March 2018: Wife and Child moved out of the matrimonial home.

(e)     2 May 2018 onwards: Husband did not have access to the Child.

(f)     Either 30 June 2018 or 8 July 2018: A dispute between Husband and Wife occurred outside of the Wife’s parents home. The police were called.

## Wife’s reasons for objecting to access

5       The Wife’s reasons for objecting to access sought by the Husband are as follows:

a.     The Husband did not provide sufficient financial support;

b.     The Husband is addicted to gambling, drinking and womanising and has converted their matrimonial home into a gambling den and is cohabiting with another woman;

c.     The Husband is not the one interested in the Child but his parents. His application for access is a front for his parents to gain access to their grandchild;

d.     The Husband’s actions on 30 June 2018 endangered the Child’s safety as he had tried to forcibly snatch the child because the Wife refused to return the wedding jewellery.

6       The Wife was agreeable to the Husband having access supervised by her every Sunday from 10:00am to 12:00pm at xxx Church. Presumably, about 1 hour of access time will be Sunday mass time.

## Reasons for the decision

7       The paramount consideration of this application was the best interest of the Child. The Wife’s objections were based on a submission that the Child will not be well-taken care of (because the Husband may abandon her to go gambling or to pursue his other interests) during access time or she would be exposed to his undesirable lifestyle.

8       I placed no weight to the Wife’s allegations to the Husband’s failure to sufficiently provide financial support as this should not be a reason to therefore cut or reduce access between a parent and child. If this allegation is true, the Wife can file an application for maintenance, which she had done previously.

9       With regard to the allegation that there are other women in the Husband’s life, if true, this would constitute behaviour which understandably the Wife will be unhappy with. However, this by itself, should not impact the father and child bond. A bad husband can still be a good father. Even if there is a breakdown in the relationship between the marriage between her parents, it is in the Child’s best interest that the reasons for the breakdown, not spill into her own relationship with both parents. There was no submission on how the Husband’s alleged relationships had impacted the Child’s relationship to warrant a reduction in access or supervision during access.

10     I could not agree with the Wife’s claim that the Husband was not interested in the Child and that it is his parents who are the real applicants. This is because despite her assertion that he did not ask for the child, there were many text messages from him pleading with her to let him see the Child which went unanswered. Admittedly, he also made references to his parents missing the Child and wishing to see her but this does not mean that he himself did not wish to see her.

11     With regard to the incident that occurred outside the Wife’s parents’ home, the date of the incident was disputed and the person who actually called for the police that day was disputed. These were not material facts. The Wife claimed the Husband was drunk and had only come to demand for the return of the wedding jewellery. He then attempted to snatch the Child to force the return of the jewellery. The Husband’s version is that he has not had access for some time and went over to see his Child but was prevented by the Wife and her family. There was no evidence that the Husband had been drunk when he attended at the residence and no evidence that he only went there for the return of jewellery. However, it is clear that the dispute on access needs to be resolved to avoid such further incidents from occurring.

12     I did have some concerns about the Husband’s drinking and gambling activities as it appears to be taking place at the matrimonial home. There was evidence of alcohol, a poker table and poker chips set up at the matrimonial home to made a finding that the Husband did engage in such activities. However, it is a stretch to describe the matrimonial home as a gambling den. I accept the Husband’s submission that he is a full time employee and therefore the Wife’s allegation of his extensive gambling is unlikely to be true. The photographs produced by the Wife of activities in the matrimonial home from the CCTV did not show any gambling activity. There was also no allegation that the Child had been around when the Husband was drinking or gambling.

13     Since the Wife and Child moved out, the other rooms in the matrimonial home was rented out and there were a few tenants now sharing the flat. The photographs exhibited by the Wife did show quite a number of other people present in the matrimonial home. These tenants or occupiers are strangers to the Child and it is unnecessary to unduly stress the Child to have the presence of such other strangers during her access time with her father. Furthermore, although I did not conclude that the matrimonial home is a gambling den, the poker table, gambling chips and alcohol _are_ in plain sight. Therefore, I ordered that access not take place at the matrimonial home as it did not seem to be a conducive environment for the Child.

14     There was no basis to conclude that it is in the Child’s best interest to order supervised access, for only 2 hours a week and to dictate that it be exercised only in a church. The Husband had lived with the Child before and prior to 2 May 2018, he did have access to the Child, which was unsupervised. The hours sought by the Husband will enable the Child to be able to maintain her bond with her father. If necessary, he has support from his family to care for the child during his access hours. Even if the Husband’s family members are present during his access, it would be also in her interest to bond with her paternal family during such time. It is unnecessary to determine if access is only for the benefit of the paternal family and not for the father.

15     I therefore allowed the father to have access to the Child twice a week on weekdays so that he can have dinners with her as well as one weekend access.
