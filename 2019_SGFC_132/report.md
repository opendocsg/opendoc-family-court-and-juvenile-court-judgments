care and control; relocation

2 December 2019

### District Judge Nicole Loh:

## Introduction

## Background

1       The parties in this case are the parents of a 5 year old boy (“Child”). They were in a long term on and off relationship since 2004 and are not legally married. Both parties had acquired British citizenship by choice; the Mother in 2003 and the Father in 2012. The Mother had been residing in the UK for about 20 years. In the past 13 years, the Father had a pattern of residing in countries outside of the UK (such as Switzerland, Malta) for the purposes of tax benefits in stretches of about 3 years before returning to UK to live for a few years before leaving the UK again.

2       The Mother conceived in 2014 through IVF and during her pregnancy, the Father decided to move to live in Malta, and subsequently Monaco for his tax purpose. The Mother and the Child’s home was in the UK. Between the Child’s birth to 2017, the Mother and Child frequently visited the Father at the various places he resided at and also met up with him at various other countries. The Father also visited the Mother and child in the UK.

3       It was clear during the many correspondence between parties that the Father longed for more contact with the Mother and their child. He wanted the Mother to move to a country outside of the UK so that they can live together and allow him to continue to reap tax benefits. However, the Mother had much reservation as this would invariably mean she loses her financial independence, sense of stability as well as her career which she had built up over 20 years.

4       It was only in 2017 that the Mother decided to agree to leave the UK with the Child so that the family can live together. This led to parties moving to Singapore in January 2018. Unfortunately, the parties’ relationship broke down quickly in Singapore in February 2018 due to an alleged assault by the Father on the Mother. The Mother, believing she already had the Father’s consent (based on a Joint Letter of Intention) to return to the UK with the Child if their relationship broke down, did so in October 2018 without explicitly informing the Father. This led to the filing of a Hague Convention application in the UK, which ordered the return of the Child to Singapore. The Mother and child then returned to Singapore in January 2019 and lived apart from the Father. She filed an application for care and control orders and for relocation to the UK. The Father filed a cross application for care and control orders.

5       During the course of the Singapore proceedings, the Father also subsequently applied for:-

> a)     the enrolment of the child in full day kindergarten;

> b)     that both parties are restrained from removing the child from school during school-term;

> c)     that the Mother provides discovery and allows inspection of:-

>> i)       all medical reports, invoices relating to the child’s health and medical treatments in Singapore since 19 January 2019, alternatively any other document relating to the same;

>> ii)       membership certificates and other documents in relation to BUPA International insurance that the Mother had claimed to have obtained for the child, alternatively all documents relating to any insurance that the Mother had obtained for the child;

> d)     An order for the Mother to apply for a Long Term Visit Pass either based on the ground of being a graduate from INSEAD seeking employment in Singapore or alternatively based on special grounds that she has ongoing court cases;

> e)     Leave from the Court for the Father to apply for Singapore Permanent Residence together with the child and for the Mother to take all necessary steps including signing all necessary documents and giving all approvals to facilitate and support the application for the child’s Permanent Residence in Singapore;

> f)     That Registrar of Family Justice Courts be empowered to sign any document on behalf of the Mother for the enrolment of the child in full day kindergarten and applications for the Long Term Visit Pass for herself and for the child’s Permanent Residence if she fails to do so within 3 days of written notice.

6       The above application in paragraph 5 was heard together with the main applications for care and control and relocation.

## Orders Made

7       After hearing parties, I made the following orders:-

> a)     Parties shall have joint custody of the Child;

> b)     Mother shall have care and control of the Child and is granted leave to relocate with the Child to London, UK;

> c)     The Child shall be enrolled in xxx House Belgravia and the Father shall sign all necessary documents for the enrolment of the Child;

> d)     Pending such relocation, Order of Court dated 17 May 2019 regarding the time the Child spends with each party in Singapore shall continue to take effect save that for weekly weekday timing, Father shall have overnight access from after school on Tuesdays and Thursdays and send the child to school on Wednesdays and Fridays respectively;

> e)     Upon the Child’s relocation to the UK, the Father shall have access to the Child as follows:

>> i)       For the months of January, June and September, the Father shall be entitled to have access from a Friday evening for up to 10 days to the Sunday evening of the following week of each month. In the event that the number of days is less than 10 days due to inability of the Father and child’s schedule to accommodate the access, there shall be no make-up access. In other words, if the Father can only start access on a Sunday instead of Friday evening, the access shall still end on the Sunday of the following week such that weekday access will not exceed 5 days at a stretch.

>> ii)       For the months of May and October, where there is a 1-week term break, the Father shall be entitled to have access for a stretch of 14 days of each month, which should either begin or end in the middle of the term break. The 14-day access period in October shall include the Child’s birthday on alternate years.

>> iii)       For the months of March to April where there is a 4-week spring break, the Father shall have a stretch of access to the Child for 3 weeks either ending in the middle of Spring Break or beginning from the middle of Spring Break. There shall be no access on 24 April.

>> iv)       For the months of July to August where there is an 8-week Summer break, the Father shall have the Child for a stretch of 4 weeks, either in the first half or in the second half of Summer break unless parties agree otherwise.

>> v)       For the months of December to January where there is a 4-week Winter Break, the Father shall have a stretch of access to the Child for 3 weeks either ending in the middle of the Winter Break or beginning from the middle of Winter Break.

>> vi)       Subject to the restrictions above and that the Mother shall have the Child for Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur on one year and the first 2 days and last 2 days of Pessach on another year (to be alternated), the Father is entitled to elect his days of access. The Father shall give the Mother at least one month’s notice of the dates of his intended access and the Child’s residence. The Mother shall inform the Father within 1 week of receiving the Father’s written notice of any previously fixed activities of the Child that fall within his period of access and the Father shall ensure that the Child attends those activities.

>> vii)       If the Father agrees to bear the flight cost, the Mother shall fly the Child to Singapore and return with the Child to London once a year to facilitate the Father’s access to the Child in Singapore. If the Father agrees to bear the flight cost, the Mother shall fly with the Child to Europe and back to London for up to twice a year to facilitate the Father’s access to the Child outside of London;

>> viii)       The Father shall pick up and return the Child to the Mother’s residence, unless otherwise agreed between parties.

> f)     Both parties are at liberty to bring the Child for overseas trips outside the UK during his/her share of term breaks. Each party is to give the other party at least one month’s written notice of his/her intended overseas, including the fight details, itinerary details, accommodation details and contact number;

> g)     The party not with the Child in any part of a day shall have daily phone or video calls with the Child at a reasonable time after taking into account the time difference;

> h)     The Father’s solicitors are at liberty to release the Father’s passport to the Father and the Mother’s solicitors are at liberty to release the Mother’s passports and the Child’s passport to the Mother;

> i)     Either party may register/mirror the orders herein in the UK Courts and the other party shall consent to the application. Subsequent applications to vary or enforce the orders relating to the Child shall be filed in the UK Courts;

> j)     The Father’s application as set out in paragraph 5 above is dismissed.

## Appeal

8       The Father appealed on all of the orders save for custody.

## Care and control

9       The Mother applied for care and control on the basis that she has been the Child’s primary caregiver since the Child was born. She claims this is supported by the fact that the Father was residing in a different country from her and the Child until they moved to Singapore in January 2018. She also claims that even in Singapore, the Father remained reliant on her caregiving abilities as he was not able to cope. Furthermore, the Father was not in Singapore for a significant proportion of the 10 months in which they lived together. Therefore, she submits that she should have care and control of the Child.

10     The Father’s main application was very detailed consisting of 37 prayers setting out proposed specific orders on a wide variety of events, overseas travel, passport arrangements, Child’s illness, parties’ attendance at conferences/courses, religion, place of worship, schooling etc. He applied for sole care and control of the Child and in the alternative, shared care and control. His case for care and control was on the following grounds:-

> a)     He shares a very close natural bond with the Child;

> b)     He spent a lot of time with the Child even before the move to Singapore;

> c)     He has been very involved in the Child’s life in Singapore;

> d)     He pointed out that unlike the Mother, who has or will have work commitments, he has flexible work arrangements;

> e)     He has also engaged 2 domestic helpers who can assist him in the care of the Child (one of whom has cared for the Child since birth);

> f)     In contrast, the Mother has acted against the Child’s interest in abducting the Child to London in October 2018;

> g)     The Mother has attempted to alienate the Child from the Father;

> h)     The Mother has serious self-disclosed mental issues and other troubling behaviour manifesting a worrying flippancy and instability;

> i)     The Mother is a very driven career-focused woman;

> j)     Parties can work together well for shared care and control to work;

> k)     In Singapore up to October 2018, he had been living with the Child and the Mother, therefore he should have equal time with the Child. The status quo prior to the unlawful retention in UK by the Mother should be restored.

11     There is clear evidence that despite living in different countries, the Father had a real and meaningful relationship with the Child. Credit must be given to the Mother who flew out of London with the Child to meet the Father at various countries such that he had substantial contact with the Child. Of course, the Father also did his part in flying to London to visit on occasion. Parties’ submissions descended into an attempt to find a formula to determine the percentage of time in the Child’s life that he had spent with the Father. I saw no need to make a finding of whether the Child spent 56% vs 63% of the time with a parent. Either way, this Father did spend time with the Child, which was not insignificant.

12     I must add that I found the Father’s submission that the Child has an intuitive and natural inclination to be close to him because he is the genetic parent of the Child whereas the Mother is not, is completely meritless. A mother who commits herself to the pain and stress of repeated IVF procedures in the hopes of conceiving a child is no less than a mother who conceives naturally. This Mother has shown, through her actions, that she loves and cares for the Child wholeheartedly, in taking extended (unpaid) maternity leave for the Child and in being the parent who is there for the Child all of his life. She is _this_ Child’s mother in all aspects that count.

13     The Father submits that the Mother is very career-minded and quotes a statement made by her in her INSEAD papers as proof. I find the private musings of the Mother did not support the Father’s submission. This was an essay titled “What do you like best/least about your life?”. In her essay, she was merely stating the dilemma she faced between her job and being a parent. I reproduce what she wrote as it is clear after reading it in its entirely, the Father’s quote of one statement (italicised) was clearly taken out of context.

> “The miracle of having a child against all odds has really been the most amazing thing that has ever happened to me. I consider myself very lucky not just for having my son but also that it happened when it did. By the time I became a mother I have achieved a lot professionally and also in my personal life. Spending a whole year with him after he was born allowed me to enjoy motherhood without any pressures or financial difficulties. I did not want to go back to work after the year off, I was actually surprised how much I did not miss my job. But I did go back because I was not ready to give it all up in its entirety. I then was working 4 days a week and gave up travelling. I like this balance, however I know this was not sustainable long term. _In order to stay at the top, one needs to do more. Although my managers are incredibly supportive, I am the one who knows what it took for me to get where I am, so I know that to stay there, longer terms, I shall need to do more, which means less with my son._ The course (and my 6 months’ leave of absence) is another way for me to reflect on what the right solution will be.

> In other words: this is a very difficult dilemma: what I like most and least in my life are actually two sides of the same coin: I like my role (less so all the politics) but I do not like the fact that if I wish to spend time with my son, I will not be able to fulfil the requirements of the job as before. This is a big dilemma. Hence taking the time to figure out a solution, perhaps something that I haven’t even thought about before.”[^1]

14     There was no indication she chose her career over the child’s interest. On the contrary, her choices in her career since the Child’s birth showed her dedication to the Child. She had chosen to take an extended maternity leave for one year after the Child’s birth to care for him personally. She subsequently took another one year’s sabbatical leave. When she agreed to move out of UK so that parties and their Child can live together as a family, she was willing to resign from her job to achieve that notwithstanding her concerns about her financial independence as she would become dependent on the Father without any legal ties of marriage. It was fortuitous that her employers valued her and created a post in Singapore for her to remain in their employment.

15     When parties moved to Singapore, the Mother worked at a 4-day job that she managed to secure with her employers and parties had the assistance of the Mother’s long-time helper who also assisted with the care of the Child. When the Father was in Singapore, it was not disputed by the Mother that he did have daily caregiving duties. Although the Mother submits that the Father is unable to care for the child as shown by his need to seek her advice on occasions over the Child, I find that both parents were effectively jointly caring for the Child in their own ways, much like any other couple. One parent may be more familiar with certain needs of their child but it does not mean that the other parent is therefore not a suitable caregiver. However, it is also not disputed that the Father, even though he has flexible work arrangements, was not present in Singapore for periods of time for work or other purposes[^2]. This meant that the Mother would still be the parent constantly caring for the Child. The Mother is currently unemployed but her past actions have shown to me whether she obtains employment in Singapore or UK in the future, she will continue to care for the Child as she has done since he was born.

16     As for the domestic helpers that the Father has engaged, I note that one was the nanny who assisted in caring of the Child since birth. This nanny’s employment was actually terminated by the parties in Singapore as they felt that the nanny had countermanded their instructions and displayed a bad attitude. There is email and WhatsApp evidence that showed the Father in particular had a lot of friction with this nanny[^3]. The Mother then interviewed and selected a replacement helper. This replacement helper remains working with the Father. The Father, some time nearer the end of litigation, rehired the original nanny. He therefore submits he has better care arrangements for the Child as he would have the assistance of 2 domestic helpers (one of whom had cared for the Child since birth) compared to the Mother, who was intending to engage a new secondary caregiver in London.

17     Whilst the familiarity of the original nanny being around to assist in the care of the Child would ordinarily be positive, I had some misgivings about the sudden rehiring of the original nanny. This is because the Father was the one who had been more vocal about his displeasure with her. In his email to the Mother around the time of terminating the original nanny’s services, he had also regretted the Child witnessing what was probably a heated confrontation between him and the nanny. It is not known whether these underlying issues between the Father and the original nanny have been resolved or whether they would surface again after this litigation is over. Both Mother and Father had expressed some concern over the Child’s adjustment due to the departure of his original nanny, especially as it was not done in the most amicable manner[^4]. Given the history between the Father’s inability to work with this particular nanny, the Child may witness more unpleasant interaction between the Father and his nanny and may have to go through another period of emotional stress if the original nanny has to leave again. It also appears that the original nanny will not be able to continue to work as a foreign domestic worker in Singapore once she reaches the age of 60 in March 2020. In any event, even if the Father has resolved all issues he had with the original nanny, domestic help is not a replacement for a parent. They are only a source of assistance to a parent in the care of a child. I note that the Mother was the one who trained and supervised the original nanny in caring for the Child. She was also the one who interviewed and selected the replacement helper. She would similarly be able to select capable assistants for herself in caring for the Child moving ahead.

18     I find no attempt by the Mother to alienate the Father from the Child’s life. His own submissions of how close a bond he has with the Child and how much time he has spent with the Child despite living in different countries shows how the Mother has made efforts to ensure that he had a chance to bond with the Child. The Father’s submission is that the Mother tried to alienate him from the Child by insisting she also goes with the Child when the Child goes overseas to visit him, therefore he did not have alone time with the Child. This is not the usual meaning of alienation. In view of the young age of the Child, I did not see this as an attempt to alienate him. Furthermore, when the Father was in UK, there is evidence to show that he was left with the Child alone when the Mother had to care for her sick mother. Therefore, even adopting the Father’s definition of alienation, this allegation is plainly untrue. The Father’s submission also submits that it is the Mother’s refusal or reluctance to move to Monaco, Geneva, Zurich which resulted in him living apart from the Child. However, he seems not to appreciate that it was he chose to leave the country of his acquired citizenship and the country where his partner was about to give birth to their child. He prioritised his tax savings over remaining in the same country and home with his child. Whilst his desire to live with his Child can be appreciated, the Mother’s unwillingness to leave her country of choice, her career and financial stability and move to a foreign country with her young baby is also understandable.

19     The Husband’s submissions referred to the Mother’s unlawful retention of the Child in UK in October 2018 to show this as an attempt to alienate him from the Child and that the Mother had acted against the best interest of the Child. I accept that the Mother had been found to have unlawfully retained the Child in UK which led to the return order. Parties had some dispute over the terms of interim access whilst the Child was in London which were quickly resolved by the UK Courts and complied with. I see no evidence by the Mother to alienate the Father from the Child.

20     The Father also submitted that the Mother has a mental disorder, diagnosis of which is unclear. He made this submission on the basis of her case in the Hague Convention where she tried to resist a return order. I had already considered this submission in an earlier application that he had applied for to obtain medical records of the Mother as well as for an order for her to be medically examined. I repeat my analysis of the medical evidence surrounding the Mother’s case during the Hague Convention set out in my earlier grounds of decision UYJ v UYK <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGFC 76</span>. There is evidence of messages from the Father that during their relationship, he had no issues with the Mother’s caregiving abilities and often praised her for being a good mother[^5]. I find his submissions of the Mother having mental issues now or discovering she has some mental issues contrived for the purpose of litigation. I do not find any evidence that the Mother has any mental disorder that affects her caregiving ability.

21     During the course of proceedings, both parties had exhibited written testimony from many friends, family and even from people whom I would not even consider as acquaintances[^6]. I did not rely on these testimony as I considered these “witnesses” as having too remote a relationship to give evidence or opinion of both parties’ ability to parent or that they are unlikely to have witnessed or have intimate knowledge of the true state of the parties’ relationship with each other and their son just from their social interaction. I relied more on the evidence from the abundant contemporaneous emails and correspondence between parties. However, I did consider evidence from the original nanny as well as from the Child’s teachers to be relevant as they, apart from the parents, would have had more direct contact with the Child. The school reports showed that the Child was happy and progressing well in school. Although disputed by the Mother, the Father was noted to have participated in some of the school activities. With regard to the original nanny, I considered her an unreliable witness as the evidence from her was inconsistent. When she was employed with the Mother, she sent text messages praising her as a mother[^7]. However, after the start of the Hague proceedings, the nanny provided written testimony to the Father on 15 October 2018, 17 November 2018, 26 December 2018, 23 February 2019 and 24 July 2019[^8] which increased in length and details about concerns regarding the Mother.

22     The Child has clearly been cared consistently by the Mother throughout his life. Whilst the Father has also been an involved parent when possible, the undisputed periods where he was not with Child is clear that the Child’s daily welfare and care did not and could not have been taken care of by the Father. Even though the Father started to have more opportunities to care for the Child in 2018, the Father did not replace the Mother’s role as a main caregiver. I therefore granted care and control of the Child to the Mother.

23     I did not make an order for shared care and control, which was the Father’s alternative prayer. I had previously indicated in the earlier Grounds of Decision, that I am of the view that shared care and control requires a high level of co-operation between parents such that the Child’s interest is not compromised since shared care would inevitably mean the Child has to keep transitioning between different households. For example, if a child has piano lessons, both parents have to ensure the child consistently practices his playing every day regardless of which household he is in. If a child’s regular activity that fell on a Tuesday is rescheduled to a Thursday, which is when he is with a different parent, there should not be any issues with the other parent taking the child to that activity. Parents need to be mature and work together to ensure all the preparations to enable the other parent can take over this new duty without any fuss. A child should not have to deal or face with handling the underlying conflict and unhappiness between his parents over his schedule and activities.

24     The parents in this case have demonstrated to me within the 10 months that they have been in litigation in Singapore, that they are far from being able to discharge the duties placed on them if shared care and control was granted. They have brought to this Court, every single issue regarding parenting that they were unable to resolve privately. And they could not resolve many. I list some of the issues (non-exhaustive) that were brought to Court:-

> a)     Whether the Child should attend a specific synagogue;

> b)     Whether the Child should attend Sunday School;

> c)     Whether the Child should be enrolled in a specific childcare centre;

> d)     Whether the Child should be in half-day or full day childcare and subsequently, whether the Child should be in full day kindergarten;

> e)     Whether the Child should have piano / flute / basketball / soccer / Taekwondo / swimming lessons;

> f)     Whether the Child can miss school on specific religious holidays;

> g)     Whether access to the Child ordered for school holidays takes a higher priority over religious holidays;

> h)     Whether certain types of religious holidays should take precedence over other types of religious holidays;

> i)     Who should, when and where handover of the Child should take place;

> j)     The exact timing of SKYPE contact between parents.

25     An order for shared care and control will not work in the interest of this Child. The Father submitted that an order for shared care and control can work because they did manage to resolve some issues after applications were filed or that the applications were filed only because the Mother had objected unreasonably to some requests. I disagreed with his submission as they are clearly unable to work together even on minor issues such as timing of SKYPE calls and from the number and types of applications filed.

## Relocation

26     The Mother applied for relocation to the UK as she wished to return to the UK. She was of the view that parties had agreed to come to Singapore to try to live together as a family but if the parties’ relationship broke down, she could return to the UK with their Child. When she filed the application, she had lost her post in Singapore but had secured a post back in the UK. However, she no longer has this option and therefore is currently unemployed. She believes she has better chance of seeking re-employment in the UK where she had built up her network of contacts compared to Singapore. She owns her home in the UK where she and the Child had lived before moving to Singapore and she also had already registered the Child in the UK schools even prior to parties’ move to Singapore. Registrations to schools were maintained as much as possible despite the intended move to Singapore[^9] as she explained the intention was always for the Child to return to the UK once he is of age to start his formal schooling. She also states that she has found a new nanny to care for the Child after school when she is working so care arrangements are in place.

27     The Father objected to the relocation as he submitted that the Mother was relocating to alienate the Child from him. In Singapore, he will have the benefit of having both parents as well as his maternal aunt’s family in the same country. He submitted that the Child has settled well in Singapore and has made friends in his school. A relocation to the UK would be adverse to his interest and wellbeing. The Father also submitted that due to the Mother’s unlawful retention in the UK, the Child’s emotions were affected as shown by the pictures that he was drawing. He also claims that there is an increase in anti-semitism in UK and therefore it is not safe. The Mother’s relocation application was therefore made in her own interest and against the Child’s interest.

28     There is a myriad of factors to consider in a relocation application although ultimately the Court has to find whether relocation will be in the Child’s best interest. Loss of contact time, changes to the child’s life, language barriers, loss or gain of family support, advantages to be enjoyed by the relocating parent and therefore the child are some of the factors but they are non-exhaustive. In this case, the following background of the parties played a big part in my eventual decision.

29     From the time the Child was born until December 2017, his permanent home of residence was in the Mother’s apartment in London. He is a British citizen and it was intended for him to be raised in UK. The fact that the Mother quickly registered him at a very young age in known English pre-schools shows that she had already planned ahead for his life in UK. The Father himself was aware of these registrations as the Mother involved him in discussions on the same[^10] and he even directly corresponded with some of these schools.

30     The Father was residing outside of the UK but continued to have contact regularly with the Child (as stated above in paragraph 11). This does not change the fact that the Child’s home remained in London. The Father himself kept moving between rented apartments in various countries. It was because of the Father’s refusal to return to London that the Child ended up leaving London. However, the plan did not appear to be long term. The Mother always intended to return to the UK in time to start the Child’s schooling because she believed that it provided the best education[^11] .

31     There was no particular tie that Singapore had with either party that necessitated them moving to Singapore in the first place. It was merely the country that the Mother had agreed to live in. Neither party had a job in Singapore that required them to live here. Their original options were Zurich, Monaco and Geneva[^12]. The Father appeared able and willing to move to any country as long as the Mother agreed to leave the UK. Both parties originally agreed that Singapore or Hong Kong was not ideal because of pollution[^13]. It was only after enjoying a brief holiday in Singapore, that the Mother discovered she liked Singapore and the Father quickly highlighted the positive aspects of Singapore[^14] that they abandoned their previous plans and ended up in Singapore.

32     Just before moving to Singapore, parties had signed a Letter of Intention[^15]. Although held by the UK Court not to be binding, certain statements served to clarify the background and intention of parties before the move to Singapore.

> “\[Child\] was born in London, England on \[date\] and has been habitually resident in England and Wales with \[Mother\] since he was born. During this time \[Father\] was habitually resident in Monaco. We travelled extensively during the \[Child’s\] lifetime but at all times it was accepted by \[Father\] that \[Child\] would not cease to be habitually resident in England and Wales by virtue of spending time outside of the jurisdiction.

> …..

> We agree and accept that any change to our habitual residence or to \[Child’s\] habitual residence by virtue of our relocation to Singapore now, will not be treated as predictive of the appropriate jurisdiction for either of us, or for \[Child\], to remain in at any point in future. We both recognise that whilst it is our shared wish to live in Singapore now, as a family, it is impossible to ever predict long term changes and circumstances….We have agreed that although we intend to establish our home together in Singapore for the time being…..

> …..

> We wish to record the arrangements in the tragic event of a breakdown of our relationship:

>> \[Father\] has agreed that in the interest of \[Child’s\] welfare, \[Mother\] will be the primary carer and \[Father\] will have access to his son. \[Mother\] has made it clear to \[Father\] that under such unfortunate circumstances \[Mother’s\] intention will be to return to the United Kingdom where \[Father\] and \[Mother\] will seek professional advice re contact arrangements relevant to \[Child’s\] age.”

33     From the above, it is clear that the move to Singapore was never intended to be a permanent one. Furthermore, the Mother’s intention to return to the UK if the relationship broke down was made known to the Father. The Father has submitted that this Joint Letter of Intention should not be enforced as the UK Courts themselves have applied their laws and declined to enforce it. However, the statements in the Joint Letter of Intention is telling of parties’ intentions at the point of signing it. The Father has also claimed he was pressured into signing the Joint Letter of Intention. The Father is well-educated and very successful in his career. He is used to the business of contracts as well as undoubtedly has unfettered access to legal advice. He is not someone who can be pressured into signing something he does not agree with. This can be shown by the number of months they had spent in trying to draw up a financial agreement between him and the Mother to give her additional reassurance as to her financial stability if she does give up her career to move out of London. This was eventually not signed as they could not reach an agreement. Parties had in fact drawn up many agreements through lawyers, some of which were signed and some not.

34     The Child has lived in Singapore for less than 10 months before the Mother attempted to return to the UK. After the return from London, due to the ongoing proceedings before me, the Child has continued to live in Singapore for another 10 months and will continue to be in Singapore at least until this appeal is heard. I accept that the Child is well settled in Singapore and has made friends in his kindergarten. However, the Child is still very young and although of course, there will be changes in his life in changing his school and residence upon relocation, there are benefits to him in relocating to London. This relocation is more akin to a return to his original home. He has not left that home for such a long time that it is now foreign to him that he cannot easily assimilate back into. It is true that he probably will lose contact with the friends he has since made in Singapore but these friends made at such a young age are unlikely to be friends that he will continue a friendship with for life in any event. After kindergarten, the Child is likely to attend different schools from his current schoolmates and will be making new friends. Children are more likely to form more lasting and closer friendships as they grow older. The ties that the Child has formed in Singapore is nothing that he cannot rebuild back in London. And the ties in London that he forms are likely to be beneficial to him in the long run as it is more likely that he will remain in the UK since it is his home country. He will enjoy the benefits of citizenship in the UK which he does not enjoy in Singapore. Whilst the Mother’s sister is currently in Singapore, there may be plans for them to leave to the USA due to the schooling needs of her child. Whilst the Husband disputes this, it is nonetheless a fact that the Mother’s sister is not a citizen of Singapore and never intended to make Singapore their permanent home. I cannot make a decision with regard to the long-term home country of the Child based on these other parties, who may move away or out of Singapore entirely.

35     The relocation to London will ultimately mean that the Child now returns to his original home in London with his mother. He will now be attending one of the schools that he was originally intended to study at. The new term just started in his intended school in London so this would be a good time for him to return in order to immerse himself into the English education system. The Mother has also described the care arrangements she is planning to put in place when they return to London and when she returns to employment. As much as the Child is thriving in Singapore, he will similarly thrive and perhaps even more, when he returns to London.

36     One of the Mother’s submission is that she has better prospects of employment in UK compared to Singapore. This is likely true as she was based in London. However, this was not a significant factor in my decision as I am of the view that with her resume, she can get employment in Singapore although perhaps not at a commensurate level. This, by itself, is not a reason to relocate the Child.

37     I recognise that a usual consequence of relocation that is a main hurdle to relocation is the loss of access to the left behind parent. However, in this case, as stated earlier in paragraphs 30 to 31, there is no real reason that the Father has to be in Singapore. He is also a British citizen and can return to live in London. He chooses not to in order to save on taxes. He has set up a consultancy business in Singapore but it appears that he does not need to physically work in Singapore. This is clear when he explained how he is free most of the time to care for the child in Singapore. His business is also obviously very mobile since it enabled him to live a fairly normadic life in the past 13 years without any issue. Whilst in Singapore, it also appears that his work requires him to return to Europe on occasion. As stated earlier, Singapore was only chosen as a country to reside in for the time being because the Mother liked it.

38     The Father also has the means to have access to the Child as and when he wishes. This is why he continued to have regular contact with the Child even though he did not reside in London in the first 3 years of the Child’s life. The Father points out he had substantial contact with the Child in the first 3 years of his life, which will decrease upon relocation. This is true however, I do not agree that he is always _entitled_ to have an equivalent or equal amount of contact at the cost of the Child’s needs. The Child was young and able to travel frequently in the past. As the Child grows, he will have more competing needs to meet, such as schooling and extra-curricular activities. Both parties’ time with the Child will naturally be affected as he engages in more activity that will be independent of the parties.

39     With regard to the anti-semitism concern of the Father, I cannot make a finding that it is true that it is on the rise in the UK and therefore the Child should not relocate to the UK. Despite the globalisation of the world, there remains prejudices and stereotypes based on ethnicity and religion in every country to varying degrees. I see no evidence that there is a high level and real risk of danger to Child to relocate back to the UK because of possible anti-semitism feelings. In fact, I was reminded of the small Jewish community in Singapore where they have only a few synagogues and where Sunday school is only conducted at one synagogue. I would imagine that support for the Jewish community and lifestyle in the UK would be better available.

40     Therefore, after considering all the above factors, given that the Child will have real benefits in relocating back to London and given that the Father can continue to have regular access to the Child, I allowed the relocation. The Father’s wish to avoid taxes should not dictate the country the Child should remain in or move to. The fewer opportunities in having regular access caused by his own decision not to live in UK should not override the Child’s interest in having a stable home and environment that the Mother is able to provide.

## Access

41     Having allowed the relocation, I then considered the amount of access that the Father should have in London. The Father’s proposal was simply that he should be given up to half of the Child’s time with prior notice to be given. I note this seems to contradict the Father’s previous submission against relocation that he will have greater difficulty in having access due to the geographical distance.

42     The Mother’s proposal for access was for the Father to have up to 7 days of access in a month. They will then share the school holidays equally (although each party takes a maximum stretch of 2 weeks for the next 4 years). The Father can choose his period of access upon giving at least 1-month notice and the only restrictions are he should not have access during Mother’s Day, the Mother’s birthday, the Child’s birthday on consecutive years, and 6 of the 13 yom tov religious holidays.

43     The Father, in arguing against the Mother’s proposal on access, appeared to be objecting for the sake of objecting. He first objected to the 7 days of access per month to only be taken at a stretch (although this was to reduce the number of times he has to keep flying in and out of the UK). When the Mother responded to say he can split up the 7 days if he wished to, his supplemental submission complained about the prohibitive cost in him having to fly up more than once a month. He also complained that there may be occasions where he has to split up his access because if he wished to have access on Father’s Day (3rd Sunday of June) and on his birthday (30 June), he will have to break his access in 2 tranches. In my view, these are not insurmountable challenges. He could stay for the entire period even if he does not see the Child everyday. He could also celebrate either occasion together or on a different date. This reinforces my view that parties cannot agree on even the simplest issue for shared care and control to work. The Father calculated the increased cost in him having to exercise access in London, whilst he lives in Singapore. However, this is not a case that the Father cannot afford this[^16]. If this cost is really a serious issue to the Father, perhaps his decision to remain living in Singapore merits some reconsideration.

44     In coming up with the access orders for the Father, I tried to allow him as much access as reasonable considering the fact he had to fly between Singapore and London. His proposal to have access whenever he was able to fly up would create too much instability to the Child’s life. I was also cognizant of the fact that parties will argue over priority of the type of access which falls within the same month.

45     Therefore, for the months of January, June and September, where there were no school holiday breaks, I granted the Father a stretch of access that would last up to 10 days covering 2 weekends. This would provide the Father half of the weekends in the months to spend time with the Child. I did not order half of the month the Child is going to school for the entire month. As it is, the access already affects one of the weeks when the Child is attending school. Since the Mother is agreeable to this in her proposal, I accordingly ordered but did not extend it to affect any additional school day.

46     For the remaining months, they would be affected by some school break. I ordered access such that would allow the Father to have access at a stretch and would also divide the school holidays equally between the 2 parents.

47     The Father has his choice of dates of access as long as he provided the Mother at least one month’s notice save for the following restrictions:

> a)     No access on the Mother’s birthday.

> b)     The Mother had originally asked to be able to spend at least 6 of the yom tov Jewish holidays. This means the Father will have the opportunity to have access on the remaining 7 yom tov Jewish holidays as well as all other non yom-tov Jewish holidays. She subsequently revised it to ask for 7 yom tov Jewish holidays to be alternated between the 2 of them. I took into consideration that the Father may not be able to arrange for access to coincide with all the other holidays as he has about 1/3 to ½ of a month to spend with the Child. So despite her best intentions, the Mother is likely to have more opportunity to spend the other Jewish holidays with the Child. Therefore I ordered the 7 specific yom tov days to be alternated between the 2 parties.

48     The Mother offered to fly with the Child to and fro Singapore for each summer holiday during the years of 2020 to 2022. She also offered to fly to and fro with the Child to Europe to facilitate the Father’s access twice a year. She proposed that the Father bears the cost.

49     I ordered this subject to the Father’s willingness to bear the flight cost. The order is not to bind the Father to such access arrangement and to pay for it but to give the Father this option for his access and the Mother shall then make herself available to fly with the child, if he does opt for it.

50     There was an issue when interim orders were made as to the handover of the Child between parties. I expect the Father to look forward to spending time with the Child and as I have not fixed specific timing for access, there is potential for handover to occur when the Mother is working whereas I do not expect the Father to have other commitments when he is in London for access. Therefore I also provided for the Father to pick up and return the Child to the Mother’s residence in the UK, unless otherwise agreed.

51     I ordered SKYPE access to each parent when the Child is not with him or her. Unlike the interim orders, I did not specify the exact timing in view of the uncertainties of their schedules in future and the time difference. I hope that moving forward, parties can work together to resolve these day-to-day issues in a sensible and reasonable manner.

52     In view of the fact that the Child will be relocated to London and this relocation is likely to be permanent, I ordered that the Singapore orders be mirrored in the UK and subsequent applications, whether enforcement or variation, to take place in the UK. As the Child will be residing in the UK, the UK Courts will be able to efficiently deal with applications as well as obtain and consider evidence in relation to the Child’s life in the UK. This was also proposed by the Father’s solicitor during the hearing before me.

## Father’s application for enrolment of child in full day kindergarten and restraining orders against both parties from removing the child during school term.

53     By the time of hearing, the Child was already enrolled in full day kindergarten in Singapore. I therefore did not have to make an order for this. I also saw no need to make restraining orders against both parties from removing the child from the kindergarten during school-term. Neither party had attempted to do so. Whilst the Mother had originally objected to the enrolment of the child into the kindergarten after their return from London, she has complied with orders made relating to the Child’s schooling.

## Discovery application in relation to medical documents and insurance

54     The Father explained that he needed such documents in order to fulfil his duty as a parent with joint parental duties with regard to major health and treatment issues of the Child. He claimed that he also applied as he was concerned that the Mother had forgotten to pay other medical bills of the Child. The Mother denied this but claimed that the medical bill had been wrongly sent to the Father. There was no allegation that the Child had been seeing any specific specialist or doctor for any major medical ailment. If there were any, I would expect the Mother to forward any reports or memos from such doctor(s) to the Father. However, this was not the situation. There is no need for the Mother to forward every single medical invoice for all medical treatments, be it a common cold or flu, the Child has received in Singapore. With regard to the unpaid bill, it is a one-off situation and even if it recurs, I do not see it necessary to therefore make orders to deal with it. Parties should, as mature adults and parents, sort it out between them.

55     With regard to the insurance documents, the Father asked for details of the Mother’s insurance which would cover the Child. He similarly asked for this on the basis that he needs to know all medical history of the Child in order to make joint decisions on major medical matters. The Mother’s position is her original medical insurance policy (which was linked to her previous employment) will expire and she will be making arrangements to obtain a new policy. The Father has himself purchased an insurance policy for the Child. I see no purpose in ordering the Mother to provide her insurance policy when she is not claiming reimbursement of the Child’s medical expenses through the Father’s insurance policy. She has already stated she will pay for the Child’s expenses when he is with her and the Father can pay for the Child’s medical expenses (and claim on his own medical insurance) if the Child is with him. Whilst I see the economic benefits of not over-covering the Child’s medical expenses through insurance, I can understand the Mother’s plan for each parent to handle the Child’s medical expenses separately to avoid further disputes between parties.

## An order for the Mother to apply for a Long Term Visit Pass either based on the ground of being a graduate from INSEAD seeking employment in Singapore or alternatively based on special grounds that she has ongoing court cases

56     The Father has applied for this on the basis that if relocation is not allowed, the Mother should apply for this type of Long Term Visit Pass in order to remain in Singapore on a longer term basis. He applies for this on the basis that it will be in the Child’s best interest for his Mother to be able to remain in Singapore with him long-term.

57     I had allowed for relocation so there is no necessity for this order. The Mother has also never claimed a difficulty in remaining in Singapore or declared an intention to leave the Child in Singapore if relocation as not granted. However, even if I did not allow relocation, I would not have ordered this as I cannot fathom a situation where a Court can order a person to apply for an immigration status that he/she does not personally desire. In this case, to apply for the Long Term Visit Pass envisaged by the Father requires a local sponsor. The Father has managed to find a local sponsor for the Mother. This local sponsor does not have a personal relationship with the Mother but with the Father. I would assume a local sponsor will be making certain undertakings to the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority in such an application. I am not sure whether such a sponsor, who does not even know the person whose application he is sponsoring well, is suitable. If approved, any immigration status also comes with different terms and conditions. Should these terms and conditions be imposed by the Court on an unwilling person?

58     The Father has submitted other cases in which the Court had made orders with regard to the application of various immigration passes of parties. I distinguish all of them from the current case as those cases all involve a dependent spouse who intends to remain in Singapore and the sponsor spouse refuses to maintain or renew the dependent spouse’s immigration passes. Therefore the Court in those cases was facilitating the application of an immigration status which the applicant himself/herself was agreeable to.

59     The Mother should be able to choose for herself the type of immigration pass she wishes to remain in Singapore under. She is an adult who can make this decision herself without the Father or the Court prescribing it for her. If she chooses to leave Singapore even if relocation is not allowed, that is her choice as long as the Child does not leave. Whilst of course, it will be in the best interest of a child that his mother remains in the same country he has to reside in, I do not think the powers of the Court extend to directly ordering immigration status or country of residence on a party. In the same vein, I don’t believe the Father should be ordered to return or remain in London with the Child if he is unwilling to. It should be his choice and he has been able to make his own choices with regard to his country of residence freely.

## For the Child to be a Singapore Permanent Resident

60     The Father applied for this on the basis that he was applying for Singapore Permanent Resident status and upon his successful application, the Child’s Dependent Pass will be terminated. Therefore, for the Child to remain in Singapore, he can either apply for Long Term Visit Pass or a Student Pass. He therefore applies for an order to allow him to apply for a Singapore Permanent Resident status with the Child.

61     The Mother objects to this as she claims they never had the intention to live in Singapore permanently. She claims the Father’s sudden desire to reside in Singapore on a long term basis is only due to his bid to keep the Child in Singapore. She points out that if the Child obtains Singapore Permanent Residence status, he would have to serve national service. She submits that it is not in the Child’s best interest for his immigration status to be linked to the Father’s immigration status and be subjected to mandatory military service of a country he is not a citizen of.

62     This application again falls since I have already ordered relocation of the Child. However, even if I did not allow relocation, I would also have dismissed this application. This is in view of the background of this Child, his country of origin, his ties to Singapore as elaborated above. I do not deem it to be in the best interest of the Child to be a Singapore Permanent Resident for the following additional reasons:

> a)     The Child has been in Singapore for less than 2 years of his life. Other than the Father’s own wish to be a Singapore Permanent Resident, there is no compelling reason for the Child to also be a Singapore Permanent Resident now;

> b)     The Child can continue to stay in Singapore, if required, under a Student Pass. Alternatively, if the Mother finds employment, he can remain in Singapore under a Dependent Pass;

> c)     The Child adopting Singapore Permanent Resident status would impose long term obligations on him, such as serving military service, as pointed out by the Mother. In addition, he will have to apply for exit permits and put up a bond if he intends to remain out of Singapore for an extended period after he turns 13 years of age. Given the background of parties and the Child, I cannot discount the real possibility of the Child leaving Singapore to live or to study. I see no benefit in committing him to these restrictions and obligations at this point in time;

> d)     Given the Father’s history of moving country to country in the past few years, it remains possible that he may choose to live in a different country subsequently even if he truly wishes to remain in Singapore currently. I see no need to change the Child’s residential status to match the Father’s, given how the Father’s has changed repeatedly over the years. Whilst the Father can still change his mind about Singapore subsequently, the Child may still be bound. Whilst there appears an option for the Child to renounce his permanent resident status, there are also adverse consequences relating to his future ability to work and live in Singapore.

## Conclusion

63     The parties in this case clearly love their Child. Despite their physical separation when the Child was born, they had managed to co-parent effectively. It is unfortunate that when their relationship broke down, this appears to have completely disintegrated their co-parenting ability. Instead of requests, there are lengthy and almost daily letters of demands between solicitors. Instead of giving time for consideration or providing reasons for persuasion, an application in Court is taken out. The Court has become a crutch that is being leaned on for every disagreement when it should be the parties who should sensibly resolve these disputes themselves in the best interest of their child instead of invoking the powers and jurisdiction of the Courts. Perhaps when the dust of litigation settles or is allowed to settle, parties can remember and rebuild an effective co-parenting relationship so that the Child can grow up without having his daily life being the subject matter of litigation.
