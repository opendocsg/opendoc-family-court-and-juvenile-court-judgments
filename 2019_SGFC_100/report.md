Consent orders – Variation – Material change in circumstances

11 September 2019

### District Judge Lim Keng Yeow:

## INTRODUCTION

1       The parties obtained Interim Judgment of divorce on 14 May 2018. Following that, they were able to agree on all ancillary matters. On their agreed terms, they entered into a Consent Order on 20 June 2018 (“the Consent Order”).

2       On 12 March 2019, the Defendant (hereafter “the Mother”) filed SUM 834/2019, seeking to vary substantially the access arrangements provided for in the Consent Order. The matter came before me. I took a restrained approach, declining to make a number of the orders sought and instead making orders effecting only limited and modest changes which I considered to be in the children’s interest. The Mother appealed against my decision and these Grounds address her appeal.

#### The Consent Order dated 20 June 2018

3       The Consent Order provided for the parties to have joint custody of their son, then aged 6 years. The Father was to have care and control and the Mother was to have reasonable access on terms set out in paragraph 1(c) of the Consent Order. The order and agreement was essentially for the Mother to have access as follows:

> (a)     Daily access on weekdays from midday after the son’s school and up to 1 hour before his bedtime,

> (b)     Weekend access every Sunday from 9am to 8pm,

> (c)     Overnight access up to 7 days during the June and December school holidays,

> (d)     Overnight access once a month at the residence of the Plaintiff (“the Father”),

> (e)     Lunar New Year access every alternate year beginning from 2019, and

> (f)     Overseas access (with certain terms spelt out but with no length limitation for either party).

#### The Mother’s application

4       The Mother’s application in SUM843/2019 sought to reduce daily access during the weekdays to occur only on Mondays and Wednesdays. Beyond that, the application also sought to:

> (a)     Introduce weekly overnight access,

> (b)     Enlarge school holidays access (to half of every school holiday period, including March and September),

> (c)     Create new categories of access (during public holidays and special occasions), and

> (d)     Provide for overseas vacations by either parent with the child to be for up to 14 days yearly and that either parent may take the child overseas during his/her period of care/access without the need to seek the consent by the other, as long as 7 days’ notice is given to the other.

5       The Mother’s application was based essentially on there being a material change in circumstances under section 128 of the Women’s Charter. She also contended that variation was reasonable and for the welfare of the child and hence was justifiable under section 129 of the Charter.

#### Approach for Consent Orders recently made

6       The single most striking fact before me was that the variation application was made only _10 months_ after the existing orders were made. While not determinative in and of itself, this factor is always highly significant. Ordinarily, the shorter the intervening period of time, the harder it ought to be for a party to show that material changes have now occurred. Here, the added consideration was that the orders the Wife now wants to vary were made by the consent of both parties.

7       Learned counsel for the Husband drew my attention to a few cases on the approach to be taken as regards the variation of consent orders, cases I found to be instructive. In my view, they clearly set out the principle that the court should be slow to vary orders were made by the consent of both parties, especially where agreement was rather recently arrived at, and was reached following a period of negotiations where both were separately represented by counsel.

8       In _TOC v TOD[^1]_, the High Court held that while the Charter may confer the power to vary the terms of a consent order when there is a material change in the circumstances, that power must be exercised sparingly. Furthermore, in deciding whether there was a material change in the circumstances and whether varying the orders was reasonable for the welfare of the child, it was held that the court ought to consider whether the application is made too soon after the consent order, or that the circumstances now raised in order to justify variation ought reasonably to be within the contemplation of the parties when they made their agreement[^2].

9       It is worth noting that the consent order in that case was made in July 2011, whereas the variation application was filed in September 2015, some 4 years after. On the facts of the case, the High Court declined to allow leave to appeal on the basis that the chances of the appeal succeeding would be “very low”.

10     Other cases consistently indicate that the court should be very slow to vary consent orders entered into by parties in circumstances where there are no vitiating factors (such as misrepresentation, mistake, duress, undue influence, unconscionability[^3], or absence of full and frank disclosure[^4]). When the common understanding between the parties was made into a consent order, the court should not substitute what the parties agreed to with “its own agreement”: _Seah Kim Seng v Yick Sui Ping_[^5]_._

11     The court has to respect the fact that parties may have their own private reasons for arriving at a settlement and would be wrong to revise the terms arrived at by the parties simply because such revision will achieve a more equitable result: the High Court in _AON v AOO[^6]_.

#### Application to facts of this case

12     As mentioned earlier, in the instant case, orders which the Wife applied to vary were made by consent, and made only a matter of months before. At the time of the Consent Orders, both parties were legally represented. Negotiations on the ancillary matters took place through multiple exchanges of letters over some 3 weeks. The Wife contended that she was subjected to some “bullying” and “threats” which she claimed affected the negotiations. But I had no difficulty rejecting those assertions, especially since she was independently advised and represented. There was nothing which vitiated the agreement.

#### Material changes in circumstances?

13     Apart from the caution and restraint that must be exercised over varying orders made by consent of both parties, I also considered if there were indeed material changes in circumstances which supported the variations she sought. I was not persuaded of that. What she put forward as material changes were:

> (a)     The Father’s “uncooperative conduct” making it difficult for her to exercise access;

> (b)     She now had stable living arrangements as to be able to accommodate the son more regularly, and

> (c)     Her concern that the son’s attitudes toward her had turned for the worse following the divorce.

14     In my view, the first and third assertions, even if they were true, would not make variation the appropriate recourse. For her first assertion especially, which I understand to be her chief complaint, I also could not see how it justified her prayers, for example, for categories of access to now be expanded.

15     The second assertion could support a change in how access takes place and potentially open the door to more overnight access. However, this change would have been reasonably within contemplation of the Mother when the agreement was made. After all, it was already clear that she could not continue living in the matrimonial home, and had to obtain her own accommodation.

16     Furthermore, a restrictive approach is necessary to ensure that any variation does not go beyond what is necessary to give effect to the core or spirit of the original agreement[^7]. The Consent Orders provided for overnight access on a monthly basis and during the long school holidays. Introducing _weekly_ overnight access now sought would appear to go too far beyond the agreement.

17     In my view, the Wife’s application for variation was an attempt to re-write the Consent Orders. I saw every reason to deny her the same, and declined to make the orders she sought.

#### Orders varied

18     I add that I was eventually prepared to vary the Consent Order by making some changes of a limited nature.

19     Paragraph 1(c)(iii) of the Consent Order provided for the Mother to have monthly overnight access at the Father’s residence. This was now unnecessary and also unworkable as the Father’s new girlfriend now resides there. I removed the reference to access taking place _at the Father’s residence_. In addition, I also decided to vary paragraph 1(c)(iv) relating to Lunar New Year access. The existing order only states that the Wife may have access “during Lunar New Year holidays every alternate year” without specifying any timings. Given indications of an acrimonious relationship between the parties, I believed that it would be in the child’s interest for precise timings to be spelled out and I did so.

20     Finally, after I have communicated my inability to make the orders sought by the Wife, my attention was specifically drawn to paragraph 1(c)(i) of the Consent Order, which states:

> The Defendant shall have daily access to the child in weekdays from midday, after the child’s school hours, up to one hour before the child’s bedtime at about 9.00pm and on every Sunday from 9am to 8pm.

21     I was invited to vary the paragraph to clarify if daily weekday access applied also during the school holidays. I was most reluctant to do so, and was prepared to only because I accepted that there was ambiguity and that clarity in this would be something in the child’s interest as it reduces the matters the parties have to bicker over.

22     I noted the specific reference to the child’s “school hours” in that paragraph dealing with weekday access, which seemed to suggest that the portion of the orders related only to the school term. Hence, I understood the words as meaning that weekday access was to occur only during the school term. Weekend access would occur weekly, independently of the school term. It was, of course, rather anomalous for daily access to occur only during the school term but not during school holidays. But that alone was insufficient to point me to a different conclusion. Rather than to inject my own assessment of what would be reasonable, my duty was to best understand what the parties had agreed to and give effect to their agreement. I varied the wording of the existing paragraph based on my best efforts to understand their agreement.

#### Conclusion

23     In the circumstances, I declined to make the orders sought by the Wife and decided to vary paragraph 1(c) of the Order of Court dated 20 Jun 2018 as follows:

> That the Defendant shall be granted reasonable access to the child as follows

>> (i)    The Defendant shall have daily access to the child during the school term on weekdays from midday, after the child’s school hours, up to one (1) hour before the child’s bedtime at about 9.00 p.m., and have access every Sunday from 9.00 a.m. to 8.00 p.m;

>> (ii)   The Defendant shall have overnight access to the child up to 7 days during the June and December school holidays respectively;

>> (iii)   The Defendant shall have overnight access to the child once a month in addition to June and December overnight access;

>> (iv)   The Defendant shall have access to the child during the Lunar New Year holidays every alternate year beginning with 2019 from 6pm on New Year’s Eve to 6pm on the Second Day of the Lunar New Year;

>> (v)    \[No change, existing orders to stand\].
