Variation of Conduct of Sale – Insertion of Registrar’s Empowerment Clause

2 July 2020

### District Judge Goh Zhuo Neng:

## A.   INTRODUCTION

1       In this application, the Plaintiff prayed for the variation of an ancillary order made on 19 October 2018 (the “**Order**”). In respect of the division of the matrimonial assets, the Order provided that:

> a)     The matrimonial home was to be sold in the open market within 6 months of the date of the Order (by April 2019).

> b)     The sales proceeds of the matrimonial home after deducting the outstanding mortgage loan and costs and expenses of the sale, would be divided 60 : 40 in favour of the Plaintiff. After receiving their share of the sale proceeds, parties were to refund to their Central Provident Fund (“**CPF**”) account any monies utilised from their CPF account for the purchase of the matrimonial home and interest that had accrued on those monies.

> c)     Parties would have joint conduct of the sale.

> d)     From 1 October 2018, the Defendant would bear the utility bills of the matrimonial home.

> e)     From 1 October 2018, the payment for the property tax, insurance payments and town council charges for the matrimonial home were to be split 60 : 40 between the parties with the Plaintiff paying more. The Plaintiff would pay for the expenses first and be reimburses from the Defendant’s share of the sale proceeds of the matrimonial home.

> f)     Parties shall retain all other assets (aside from the matrimonial home) held in their sole name.

2       In this variation, the Plaintiff was seeking to be given sole conduct of the sale of the matrimonial home, for a registrar’s empowerment clause to be inserted into the Order and for the Defendant to vacate the matrimonial home within 1 month from the date the matrimonial flat is sold. The Defendant is currently living in the matrimonial home with the child of the marriage.

3       I heard both parties on 25 March 2020, and varied the terms of the Order to provide that:

> a)     That the sale of the matrimonial home in the open market would be completed by 25 March 2021.

> b)     That the Plaintiff would have sole conduct of the sale of the matrimonial home and be able to unilaterally fix the price of the property, appoint and fix the remuneration of lawyers and agents for the marketing and sale of the property.

> c)     A registrar’s empowerment clause would be inserting, empowering the Registrar or Assistant Registrar of the Family Justice Courts, to execute, sign or indorse all necessary documents relating to the sale of the matrimonial home on behalf of the Defendant, should the Defendant fail to do so within 7 days of written request.

> d)     That the Defendant must vacate the matrimonial home 4 weeks before the date of the completion of sale for the matrimonial home.

4       On 3 April 2020, the Defendant filed her Notice of Appeal against the whole of my decision. The Plaintiff has not appealed against my decision. My full grounds of decision is set out below.

## B.   THE LAW

5       The power to vary an ancillary order for the division of property under section 112(4) of the Women’s Charter (“**WC**”) has to be exercised narrowly and does not extend to the power to revisit or reopen the order.

6       A variation in this case does not necessarily require a material change of circumstances. In a scenario like the present where a variation of an order relating to the division of property is sought and the order has not yet been implemented, the Court of Appeal in _AYM v AYL_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 1 SLR 924</span> (“**AYM**”), has set a high threshold, requiring the order to be unworkable under the following two scenarios.

> a)      _Scenario 1 –_ Where the order might become impossible to implement due to new circumstances which have arisen. These new circumstances would have to had so radically changed the situation so that to implement the order would be to implement something radically different from what was originally intended.\[25 to 27\]

> b)      _Scenario 2 –_ Where the order is unworkable to begin with. This may arise where the is a lacuna or gap in the ancillary matters order. Here, the Court is concerned with stepping in to address the lack of administrative functionality of the order. \[28 and 29\]

7       The Order also contained a “liberty to apply” clause. As stated by the Court of Appeal in _APE v APF_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 783</span>, \[12\], such orders are only intended to supplement the main orders of the court in form and convenience so that the main orders of the court may be carried out.

## C.   THE POSITIONS TAKEN BY PARTIES

8       The Plaintiff’s position was that the sale of the matrimonial home could not proceed. This was because the Defendant was refusing to cooperate with him in the sale of the matrimonial home.

9       At the heart of this was a dispute between the parties relating to $20,000 that was allegedly owing by the Plaintiff to the Defendant. The Defendant’s insistence on repayment of this amount before rendering cooperation to sell the matrimonial home was clear from the following text messages to the Plaintiff:

> a)    “_Stop msg me._ **_Return my 20k then sell._** _My Reno money 20k before interest…”-_ page 8 of the Plaintiff’s supporting affidavit.

> b)    “_Nonsense is you. Now_ **_I waiting you return my 20k not I don’t sell._** **_You cheat Judge from start and said you paid 20k._** _stop msg me.”_ – pages 15- 16 of the Plaintiff’s supporting affidavit.

> c)     _“Your big mouth (Plaintiff’s Mother) already get punishment. Whole family like that. Like mother like son._ **_Now you return my 20k then we sell._** _You still got money from insurance.”_ – page 16 of the Plaintiff’s supporting affidavit.

> d)     _“Stop msg me._ **_When you return my 20k then we sell_** _. I waste my savings and my 10 year believe you are good people…”_ – page 16 of the Plaintiff’s supporting affidavit.

> (Emphasis added in bold and underline)

10     In her reply affidavit, the Defendant explained that the $20,000 was paid by her for renovations done to the matrimonial home. As the amount was paid from an account in joint names, the source of the funds was disputed during the ancillary matters hearing.

11     Amongst other things, the Defendant also asked that the proportion of her sale of the matrimonial proceeds ad her maintenance be reviewed, the $20,000 be returned to her, that both parties retain joint conduct of the sale and that the matrimonial property be sold in 2021 after the child of the marriage completed his Primary School Leaving Examinations (“**PSLE**”).

12     At the hearing, it was submitted by the Defendant’s counsel that she would be willing to vacate the matrimonial home 2 weeks before the completion of the sale.

## D.   APPLICATION OF LAW TO THE FACTS

13     It was clear that the Defendant was unhappy with the manner in which her claim for $20,000 had been resolved by the Order. She was also unhappy that the matrimonial home might be sold prior to her child’s PSLE and the terms of her maintenance. Having not filed an appeal against the Order, or for an application to set aside or vary the Order, she was now trying to get justice on her own terms by obstructing the sale of the matrimonial home. This was obvious from the tone and frequency of her allegations against the Plaintiff.

14     This delay was unproductive and considerable. The property was supposed to have been sold by April 2019 – nearly one year ago.

15     It would not be fair for the Defendant to hold up the sale of the matrimonial home for the above reasons. The issues she was concerned with had already been determined by the Court and were not the subject of appeal. In the meanwhile, the consequences for the Plaintiff were twofold, he was unable to obtain the proceeds of sale of the matrimonial home, and he would not be able to purchase a new flat under the HDB rules as the matrimonial home was still vested in his name.

16     I took the view that there were two possible bases under which I could make orders to ensure that the sale of the matrimonial home could proceed expeditiously.

> a)     Treating this as a Scenario 2 case under _AYM_ . Without the Defendant’s cooperation, the Order was unworkable and the sale of the matrimonial home could not proceed. The Order only provided for joint conduct of sale and had not provided for the scenario where the Defendant became uncooperative and continued to squat in the matrimonial home.

> b)     Rely on the “liberty to apply” clause. If the Defendant was continuing to hold up the sale of the matrimonial home, this presented an obstacle to the carrying out of the Order for the sale of the matrimonial home.

17     Accordingly, given the Defendant’s determination to hold up the sale process, I made the following orders to ensure that the sale of the matrimonial home would proceed expeditiously :

> a)     The Plaintiff be given sole conduct of the sale and insert a registrar’s empowerment clause with 7 days written request.

> b)     That the Plaintiff would be able to unilaterally fix the price of the property, appoint and fix the remuneration of lawyers and agents for the marketing and sale of the property.

> c)     That the Defendant must vacate the matrimonial home 4 weeks before the date of the completion of sale for the matrimonial home. This was actually 2 weeks longer than what the Defendant’s counsel had asked for at the hearing.

18     Finally, I ordered that the Plaintiff be given sufficient time to complete the sale of the property by 25 March 2021 – one year from the date of my order. The Plaintiff would require sufficient time would be required to find a buyer, and allowance must also be made for the duration of the sale process from the signing of an Option to the Completion of the sale.

19     As mentioned above, the detrimental effect of further delay would weigh heavier on the Plaintiff. The Defendant has had more than 1 year to find a new home. She continues to reside in the matrimonial home without needing to make up front payment for the property tax, insurance payments and town council charges for the matrimonial home – which the Plaintiff has to settle first. She is well positioned to bunker in for the long run while she obstructs the sale of the matrimonial home. This is not a form of behaviour that should be encouraged, especially in matrimonial proceedings. It deprives parties of the finality and resolution they are seeking in divorce proceedings in order to move on with their lives.

## E.   CONCLUSION

20     For the reasons set out above, I made the above orders.
