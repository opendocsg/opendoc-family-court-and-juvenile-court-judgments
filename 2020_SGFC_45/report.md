Ancillary Matters – Division of Matrimonial Assets

8 June 2020

### District Judge Goh Kiat Yi:

### Introduction

1       This appeal arises from the ancillary matters hearing (“the AM hearing”) between the Plaintiff wife (“the Wife”) and the Defendant husband (“the Husband”) where I made orders as set out in Annex A. In essence, I awarded parties joint custody of the two children of the marriage with care and control to the Wife and specified weekly access to the Husband. I ordered the Husband to pay $900 per month as maintenance for both children. Finally, I ordered an equal division of the matrimonial assets, which takes into consideration Wife maintenance.

2       Following my decision, I convened a clarification hearing to correct certain technical and editorial errors in my orders on the division of assets. The hearing took place after the Husband filed his Notice of Appeal. By then, the Husband had appointed counsel who consented to the rectification. The Husband’s Counsel also informed the court that his client was appealing against my order in respect of the costs for the uncontested divorce hearing. In the interest of time and costs, both parties agreed that it was unnecessary to amend the Notice of Appeal to reflect the orders as rectified and for the issue of costs for the uncontested divorce hearing to be heard by the appellate court.

3       I will focus on the issue of division of matrimonial assets and costs for the uncontested divorce as the Husband has only appealed against those parts of my decision.

### Background

4       Parties were married on 26 October 2004 and they have 2 children to the marriage, namely, a daughter \[L\] and a son \[B\] who are 15 and 10 respectively this year.

5       The interim judgment of divorce was granted on 4 July 2019 on the Wife’s claim that the Husband had behaved in a way that she cannot reasonably be expected to live with him. The marriage lasted approximately 15 years.

6       The Husband is employed as a security officer at and the Wife works as a hawker assistant.

### Preliminary observation on the Husband’s conduct in these proceedings

7       For the purposes of the AM Hearing, the Wife filed two affidavits of assets and means (“AOM”). However, the Husband filed only one AOM.

8       It is important to note that at the final case conference on 23 January 2020, the Husband had informed the court that he was not going to file a second AOM in reply to the Wife’s first AOM. The learned assistant registrar conducting the case conference had informed the Husband that if he does not do so, the court might not have his version of events at the hearing. The Husband maintained that he has no money and does not know how to file. I note that this is despite him filing an AOM before.

9       Because of his unyielding position, I proceeded with the hearing with the benefit of only considering the Husband’s evidence in his first AOM. During the AM hearing, the Husband made significant reference to facts in his submissions, which were not raised, in his AOM. As these matters were not on affidavit and in any event unsupported by any documentary evidence, I did not accept these fresh evidences unless they were undisputed. This was in fairness to the Wife who had no opportunity to respond to such factual allegations raised belatedly.

10     I reiterate that the court had previously given him opportunity to file his second AOM and had put him on notice of the consequences, but the Husband elected not to do so. In my view, there is a limit to how far the Court may assist a party, even for a litigant in person, as the other party should also not be unduly prejudiced.

11     I turn now to my findings on the division of matrimonial assets proper.

### Division of Matrimonial Assets

12     Generally, the court first decides on what is the pool of matrimonial assets to be divided. Second, the court determines a just and equitable division of the assets. Third, the court makes consequential orders to effect the division. I adopted the global assessment methodology, as there was no reason or contrary submissions to adopt the classification approach.

13     As the Husband was self-represented, he was generally unable to articulate his specific contentions on the issue of division. During the hearing, the Husband repeated at length the hardship he had endured during the marriage and how the Wife had mistreated him.[^1] The Husband was also particularly emotional during the hearing and often expressed his dissatisfaction with the law.[^2] Nonetheless, I understood that he rejected the equal division sought by the Wife and wanted only to repay her CPF monies (including accrued interest) utilised for the matrimonial flat.[^3]

### The Pool of Matrimonial Assets

#### The undisputed assets

14     The following table sets out the list of the matrimonial assets declared in parties’ respective AOMs which are undisputed:

#### The disputed assets

##### The value of the matrimonial flat

15     The Wife’s position was that the flat should be valued at $500,000,[^4] whereas the Husband’ values the flat at $459,940. [^5] The Wife’s based her on a unit sold on the neighbouring block 537 for a 13th\-15th floor unit whereas the Husband estimate was from a property guru search for a unit on the 7th floor of the same block.

16     I found the Wife's estimate to be on the high side given that this was not the same block whilst the Husband's estimate was on the low side as it was a significantly lower unit of the same block. I found that an appropriate valuation would be a conservative figure of $480,000, approximately the average of the two submitted figures.

##### The Wife’s and \[B\]’s POSB Joint Account ending 9580

17     The Wife submitted that the monies in this bank account should be excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets as they are in the joint account of herself and \[B\].[^6] I disagreed as the source of monies were from her and could be withdrawn by her. This is in contrast to a CDA account where funds can only be withdrawn for specific purposes and a portion of monies would be from government-matched funds.

#### The Husband’s undisclosed assets

18     It is quite clear that the Husband has not been forthcoming with his assets and means in the present case. In his first AOM, he only provided figures of the balances in his bank accounts and values of insurance policies. There was minimal documentary evidence provided in support. This prompted the Wife to seek leave of court to administer discovery and interrogatories on him. Despite the requests being reasonable and the documents sought would contain largely basic information relevant to the dispute, the Husband plainly refused to respond to the said requests. This was his position at the case conferences on 21 November 2019 and 26 December 2019.[^7]

19     I agreed with the Wife that an adverse inference should be drawn against the Husband for plainly refusing to disclose documents relating to his finances. This can be effected by returning assets with ascertainable values back into the pool and granting an uplift for the assets for those without. I turn first to the assets, which can be determined.

##### Insurance policies

20     The Husband failed to disclose his prudential insurance policy ending 7523 of which the monthly premiums of $1,006.24 are substantial.[^8] Whilst the “face value” of the policy is $53,000, I did not agree with the Wife that this was the current surrender value of the insurance as the premiums are still payable and generally, the surrender value of insurance policies before maturity would be much lower than that on maturity. Given that the policy commenced in 2014 and runs until 2024, I found that a surrender value of around $26,500 being half of the face value would be put back into the matrimonial pool in the Husband’s name.

21     The Wife also notes that the Husband has additional insurance policies with Great Eastern.[^9] However, I excluded these policies from the matrimonial pool, as they appear to be for home protection and health. Such policies typically do not have surrender values.

##### Husband’s undisclosed SCB account ending 0479

22     The Wife produced documents of the Husband’s Standard Chartered bank account ending 0479 with a balance of $5,335.04 that he failed to declare.[^10] This will be included in the matrimonial pool in the Husband’s name.

##### Substantial dissipation of monies by the Husband

23     The Wife has provided evidence that the Husband had withdrawn $50,000 from a UOB structured deposit account in March 2018 and $20,000 in April 2017.[^11] The Husband allegedly told the Wife that he had gambled away the monies.[^12] The Wife further provided evidence that he had withdrawn $13,000 from a UOB sole account in October 2018[^13]. These allegations were unrebutted by the Husband.

24     As the aforementioned withdrawals took place from 2017 to 2018 when the marriage had already broken down, I found that these sums were dissipated by the Husband and accordingly put the amounts back into the matrimonial pool in his name. This will be a sum of $68,650 for the UOB structured deposit (being $50,000 add $20,000 less penalty fee of $1,350) and $13,000 for the UOB account.

##### Withdrawals by both parties from the SCB Joint Account ending 0053

25     At this juncture, I note that the Wife had candidly disclosed that she withdrew $10,000 from their Standard Chartered joint account after discovering the Husband had gambled, whilst the Husband had utilised the remaining $2,353.34 in that account.[^14]

26     I declined to return any sums utilised by either party to the pool of assets as this account was a joint account and the monies would have presumably been utilised for the family expenses. Further, both parties have drawn down on the account and this being a joint account, movement of monies should have been transparent to both sides.

##### Total matrimonial pool of assets

27     Based on the foregoing, the total pool of assets to be divided are:

### The division ratio

28     As both parties worked during the marriage, I applied the structured approach expressed in _ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGCA 34</span> for the purposes of arriving at a just and equitable division.

#### Direct contribution

##### Assets held in sole names

29     I found that parties contributed solely to the assets held in their respective names, as there was no serious contention or evidence to prove the contrary.

30     As for the dissipated sums at \[23\] – \[24\] above, I note that the Wife does not claim that she had contributed to those dissipated sums. It is her own case that she was a homemaker for the first few years of marriage and had worked part time or odd jobs thereafter. At the same time, she also claimed to have contributed significantly to the household expenses. I therefore found it more likely that the Husband had accumulated these monies.

##### The matrimonial flat

31     Parties’ CPF contributions to the matrimonial flat are not in dispute. The Wife and Husband contributed a principle sum (excluding accrued interest) of $10,214.82 and $144,053.00 respectively.

32     The Husband also alluded to the fact that he initially purchased the matrimonial flat with his mother and the Wife name was added after the mother’s death. However, the Husband was unable to state or provide evidence to quantify how much his mother had paid for the matrimonial flat. The Husband alluded to a figure of $134,053 in his affidavit[^15] but was unable to state what this sum was when asked during the hearing.[^16] It is therefore unclear how the mother’s contributions, if any, should be factored into the division calculations. I therefore did not attribute any further contribution to the Husband on this point as these were not strictly his contributions.

33     The Wife further claimed that she had purchased some furniture and paid for renovation.[^17] The Husband argued that he born half of the costs.[^18] As these contributions were relatively recent and not at the time of purchase of the flat, I was of the view that it would be more appropriate to consider them as indirect financial contributions. In any case, I found this to be a neutral point as the Husband would have contributed to the purchase of other furniture/renovations not mentioned by the Wife. The flat was initially purchased by his mother and him and would presumably have been furnished before.

34     Finally, parties dispute an amount of $812.15 being the administrative fees paid for the transfer of ownership of the flat in 2013. I apportioned the same equally between parties as this was a small sum and neither party provided clear evidence to support the alleged payments.

#### Summary of direct contributions

35     Based on the foregoing, parties’ direct contributions are as follows:

36     I found that the ratio of direct contributions to be **85 – 15** in favour of the Husband.

#### Indirect contribution

37     The Wife has set out at length her indirect contributions, which were not rebutted by the Husband. I accepted her contribution as follows:

> a.     She was a homemaker between 2004 and 2008, taking care of the household chores and their first child.

> b.     Thereafter, she continued to be the party responsible for the household matters, caring for children and looking at their day-to-day needs.

> c.     She also worked part time and odd jobs since 2008 to supplement the household income - paying for the household expenses such as groceries and household items.

> d.     Caring for the Husband’s mother when she was ill with cancer.

> e.     Taking care of the Husband when he was ill.

> f.     Paying for the children’s tuition, extra curriculum lessons, and saving to buy a computer for the children and a hand phone for \[L\].

38     The Wife also gave evidence that the Husband had been verbally and physically abusive during the marriage and submitted that the court ought to view this as negative contributions.[^19] However, I did not think that these incidents were sufficiently particularised or serious enough for the court to make a finding of negative contribution. The Court of Appeal has noted that the threshold for the court to ascribe a negative contribution is a high one, and conduct must be both extreme and undisputed.[^20]

39     The Husband on the other hand did not state what indirect contributions he made for the family in his affidavit although at the hearing he submitted the hardship and toil he had gone through for the family. In my judgment, it is unlikely that throughout the course of the 15-year marriage, the husband would have made insignificant indirect contributions. It is the Wife’s own evidence that she was a homemaker between 2004 and 2008 and from 2008, she worked part-time and odd jobs on a daily-rated basis. The Husband would thus have shouldered the indirect financial contributions. I note that he is also presently paying the utility bills. Finally, it is important to note that the Wife had utilised rental income for the children’s and household expenses. A large portion of this must be attributed to the Husband as a joint owner of the house.

40     From the foregoing, I found that that the Wife had contributed much more significantly on the count of indirect contributions. However, this was a moderate length marriage and the precedents show that for a homemaker spouse for such length of marriage received about 35% of the overall matrimonial pool see _BOR v BOS_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGCA 78</span>.[^21] I note that the Wife was not a pure homemaker spouse as she had worked part time and odd jobs since 2008. Considering all the aforementioned circumstances, I found the ratio of indirect contribution to be 70-30 in favour of the Wife.

#### Average ratio

41     The average ratio is therefore 57.5 – 42.5 in favour of the Husband.

### Adjustments to the average ratio

#### Uplift

42     Apart from the adverse inference I drew against the husband for his undisclosed assets and dissipated amounts above, the husband has also plainly refused to provide any documentary statements of _his declared_ bank accounts and some insurance policies. This significantly impeded the Court’s ability to ascertain the full extent of his assets.

43     I therefore granted a further uplift of 5% to the Wife bringing the average the ratio to 52.5 - 47.5. I stress that this uplift accounts for the lack of documentary disclosure of his known assets and there is therefore no double counting of the amounts that he had dissipated which were added to the matrimonial pool above.

#### Wife maintenance

44     I found it appropriate to consider the issue of Wife maintenance at this juncture. Given the husband’s conduct in these proceedings, I was of the view lump sum Wife maintenance (if applicable) should be ordered in favour of the Wife to be factored in as part of the division as it would likely be hard for her to enforce any prospective maintenance order.

45     The power to order maintenance for the Wife is supplementary to the court’s powers to divide assets and to even out any financial inequities suffered by the parties. It is also premised on the reasonable needs of the Wife.

46     Both parties are presently working. I accepted the Wife’s income to be $1,800 a month as she has tendered CPF documents in support and the Husband did not challenge this. [^22] The Husband recently started a new job with Certis Cisco as a security officer and tendered pay-slips during the hearing.[^23] The payslips show that he earned a nett pay of $1,000 in January at $2,300 in February with overtime. I found that he would likely have an earning capacity about $2,000 a month, consistent what he earned previously as gleaned from his IRAS Notice of Assessment from 2016 to 2018.[^24]

47     The Husband’s salary is slightly higher than that of the Wife. It is his own case that he had supported the Wife and gave her monthly allowance of $400-$600 during the marriage from his salary.[^25] I also note that the Wife would have suffered some financial prejudice as she bore the lion share of the indirect non-financial contributions in this 15-year marriage as found above. At the same time, I note that she also claims to have supported herself and the children from her own income, be it from part time work or odd jobs for extensive periods indicating that she was somewhat self-reliant.

48     Taking into account the aforementioned circumstances, I would award the Wife maintenance for a period of 3.5 years at $300 a month, amounting to $12,600 (which is around 1.3% of the total asset pool). This lump amount will be factored into the final division ratio below on a broad-brush basis with no orders on Wife maintenance to achieve a clean break.

#### Final Division Ratio

49     Finally, the court also has to consider the other factors in S112 of the Women’s Charter. One of these are the needs of the young children aged 15 and 10 who will primarily be cared for by the Wife moving forward. She would likely need funds to purchase a flat to put a roof over their heads.

50     Applying a broad-brush approach and taking into account my findings of Wife maintenance, I found that it was just and equitable for the matrimonial assets to be divided equally.

### Effecting the division

51     The Wife should receive a sum of $458,326.71 being half of the total matrimonial pool. Given that she already has $76,921.04 in her sole name, she would have to receive a further $381,405.67 from the sale of the matrimonial flat

52     Based on the estimated sale price of $480,000 (or even $500,000 as the Wife claimed), parties would have insufficient proceeds to refund their CPF monies (including accrued interest) and the CPF board would unlikely accept a “refund later” option for an equal division. It would be appropriate in the present case for to effect the CPF refunds first followed by a transfer from the Husband’s CPF accounts.

53     From the calculations set out in the following table (assuming the costs and expenses of sale at around 1.5%), the net cash proceeds is estimated at around $253,859.21. To be fair to the Husband that he receives cash from the division, I divided the net cash proceeds 70-30 in favour of the Wife. This means the Wife will receive an estimated $177,701.45 in cash. From this amount, the Wife requires a further $203,704.22 (being $381,405.67- $177,701.45) as CPF transfers from the Husband to achieve an equal division on all the assets.

54     I therefore ordered that the matrimonial flat be sold with the relevant deductions and CPF refunds (including accrued interest) to be made and the net sales proceeds to be divided 70-30 in favour of the Wife. Thereafter an amount of $203,704.22 from the Husband’s CPF account shall be transferred to the Wife.

55     I note that the Husband appears to have gained little from the sale of the flat. This is because he has dissipated significant amounts of matrimonial assets and is accountable for the same. He has not rebutted the Wife’s allegations that he had gambled the said sums. It is unfortunate that he chose to spend the dissipated monies for such a purpose.

#### Conduct of sale and registrar’s empowerment clause

56     The Wife has provided unrebutted evidence that the Husband had been unreasonable in the conduct of proceedings, to the extent of lodging a complaint against a case conference judge. This is also borne out by his refusal to file and further documents and provide and response to discovery and interrogatories as highlighted. His conduct at the also hearing left much to be desired.[^26] I agreed that the Wife should be awarded sole conduct of the sale of the matrimonial flat, with a registrar’s empowerment clause inserted to ensure that all orders are complied with.

### Other issues

#### CDA account

57     It appears that the Husband has a CDA account with the son. As the Wife was the parent awarded care and control, she should have the power to operate and utilise the monies in that CDA account for the benefit of the child. I therefore ordered that trustee of the CDA account be transferred from the Husband to the Wife within 1 month of the Final Judgment.

## Costs of the uncontested divorce

58     I note that the divorce was granted on the fact of the Husband’s unreasonable behaviour. The Husband did not enter appearance to participate in these proceedings. As the matter uncontested, I fixed costs at $1,000 all in, for that part of the proceedings. I further order that the costs be deducted from the Husband’s share of the sale proceeds of the matrimonial flat given the likelihood of default.
