Matrimonial law – Women’s Charter – Ancillary issues – Division of assets – Maintenance of child – Maintenance of former wife

2 June 2020

### District Judge Sheik Mustafa:

## Introduction

1       Throughout this judgment I shall refer to the Plaintiff as “the Husband”, and to the Defendant as “the Wife”.

2       The Husband had filed a writ of divorce and, by consent, his marriage to the Wife was dissolved on the Wife’s ground that the Husband had behaved in such a way that the Wife cannot reasonably be expected to live with him. The ancillary matters remained contested, and ultimately I heard them. I ordered that as follows -

> a.     The parties’ matrimonial home shall be sold in the open market within 6 months of the date of the Final Judgment to be issued herein.

> b.     The proceeds of the sale of the flat shall be used to settle any payment due to the HDB, then to settle the costs and expenses of the sale, including that of a housing agent. Of the balance thereafter, the Husband and the Wife shall be entitled to 39.1% and 60.9% respectively. Each party shall refund to their own CPF accounts any monies required to be refunded by the CPF Board from their own respective shares of the sale proceeds.

> c.     Each party is fully entitled to retain any assets that are already in their own names to the exclusion of the other.

> d.     Either party shall sign execute or endorse on any document required for the sale of the flat upon being given 5 days written notice to do so, in default of which the Registrar or Deputy Registrar or the Family Justice Court shall be empowered to sign any such document on behalf of the defaulting party.

> e.     The Husband is not liable to maintain the Wife.

> f.     No order on costs.

> g.     Liberty to apply.

3       The Husband appeals against only the part of my order regarding the sale of the matrimonial home. The following are the reasons for my judgment.

## Background facts

4       The parties married in Singapore in October 1984. The marriage lasted 34 years. There are two children from the marriage, a 33-year old daughter and a 30-year old son. All of them live in the same home, which is the flat in dispute.

5       The Husband is 67 years old and the Wife is 64 years old.

6       For most of the marriage, the Husband was the sole earner. He used to be a rubber trader, later a taxi driver, and more recently, to the present, as a private hire vehicle driver. The Wife ceased to work upon the birth of the first child. She remains a homemaker.

7       The parties successively owned three other properties before the present.

## The Matrimonial Assets

8       There is one immovable property jointly owned by both the parties. The parties acquired it during the course of the marriage. It is an HDB flat. Both parties agree that to its value as $954,000. There is no outstanding mortgage on this property.

9       The total matrimonial asset pool comprises of the following –

## Applicable principles on division of assets

10     As a start to my inquiry into dealing with the assets, I refer to section 112 of the Women’s Charter –

> **112.**—(1)    The court shall have power, when granting or subsequent to the grant of a judgment of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage, to order the division between the parties of any matrimonial asset or the sale of any such asset and the division between the parties of the proceeds of the sale of any such asset in such proportions as the court thinks just and equitable.

> (2)    It shall be the duty of the court in deciding whether to exercise its powers under subsection (1) and, if so, in what manner, to have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the following matters:

>> (a)    the extent of the contributions made by each party in money, property or work towards acquiring, improving or maintaining the matrimonial assets;

>> (b)    any debt owing or obligation incurred or undertaken by either party for their joint benefit or for the benefit of any child of the marriage;

>> (c)    the needs of the children (if any) of the marriage;

>> (d)    the extent of the contributions made by each party to the welfare of the family, including looking after the home or caring for the family or any aged or infirm relative or dependant of either party;

>> (e)    any agreement between the parties with respect to the ownership and division of the matrimonial assets made in contemplation of divorce;

>> (f)    any period of rent-free occupation or other benefit enjoyed by one party in the matrimonial home to the exclusion of the other party;

>> (g)    the giving of assistance or support by one party to the other party (whether or not of a material kind), including the giving of assistance or support which aids the other party in the carrying on of his or her occupation or business; and

>> (h)    the matters referred to in section 114(1) so far as they are relevant.

> **114.**—(1)    In determining the amount of any maintenance to be paid by a man to his wife or former wife, or by a woman to her incapacitated husband or incapacitated former husband, the court shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the following matters:

>> (a)    the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;

>> (b)    the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;

>> (c)    the standard of living enjoyed by the family before the breakdown of the marriage;

>> (d)    the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage;

>> (e)    any physical or mental disability of either of the parties to the marriage;

>> (f)    the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family; and

>> (g)    in the case of proceedings for divorce or nullity of marriage, the value to either of the parties to the marriage of any benefit (for example, a pension) which, by reason of the dissolution or annulment of the marriage that party will lose the chance of acquiring.

11     The Court of Appeal in the case of _ANJ V ANK_[^1] outlined the approach in division of matrimonial assets. Accordingly, the task at hand for me is to derive a ratio which represents the parties’ respective direct contributions towards the acquisition or improvement of matrimonial assets. Next, is to derive a second ratio, which represents the parties’ indirect financial and non-financial contributions towards the welfare of the family. I should then average the two ratios to derive each party’s overall contribution to the family. The “average percentage contribution” or “average ratio” are non-binding figures, and I would have to make adjustments as and when necessary. I bear these in mind, as well as that adjustments might also be necessary whenever the parties’ collective direct contribution do not carry the same weight as that of the parties’ collective indirect contribution.

12     Division of matrimonial assets is not an exact science, but neither is it an indefinable art. It is not mandatory for the court to exercise its power of division in every single asset of the parties before it as long as it did not detract for the court’s overall mandate to achieve a just and equitable division in the light of all of the circumstances of the case[^2].

## Application of the law to the facts

### Direct contributions

13     The parties agree on the ratio of the direct contributions between the Husband and the Wife.

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="50.7%"> <col width="49.3%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Total direct contributions</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">100%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">From the Husband</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">64%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">From the Wife</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">36%</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

14     This can be expressed as 64:36 in terms of the first ratio prescribed by _ANJ V ANK._

### Indirect contributions

15     The second ratio prescribed by _ANJ V ANK_ is that of the indirect financial and non-financial contributions towards the welfare of the family.

16     The Wife contends that she contributed 80%. The Husband contends that he contributed 50%.

17     Both parties lay contradictory versions in this regard. What is clear, however, is that this is a long marriage, in which both parties played different parental and household roles. The Husband was the principal breadwinner and the Wife was the principal homemaker.

18     The Husband presents a case of indirect financial contributions. His case is that he provided the Wife with funds for household expenses by depositing cash into a cash box weekly, in sums ranging from $700 - $1,100 a month. He also gave the Wife pocket money for her personal expenses. He paid the household bills from his bank account. In the early years of the marriage, he provided the Wife with supplementary cards for her use and for the family expenses. He provided the children with supplementary cards as well. Admittedly, he terminated all these cards only as late as 2018, and the Wife does not dispute this fact. The Wife retorts that she repaid to the Husband what she charged to the supplementary cards, but there is no corroboration of this.

19     After the sale of their penultimate property, they opened a joint bank account. They deposited the proceeds of the sale into it, in the sum of $503,748.01. They used some of it to purchase of the present flat, some of it for the son’s university fees, and there was a balance of $31,000. When the Husband received his CPF payout of $152,548.60 when he turned 55 years old in February 2007, he used that money for household expenses. The Husband is unable to produce the bank records on this. I find this to be a reasonable explanation, as this took place 13 years ago. The Husband asserts that he had always been the sole breadwinner of the family, and that the family’s standard of living did not change, even during the economic downturn that led to the demise of his rubber-trading career somewhere in 2007-2009. In spite of the paucity of corroboration I mentioned, I accept the Husband’s version of this is mostly true.

20     The Wife claims that the Husband had borrowed from her, on several occasions. The Husband’s response to this is that the borrowings were for the family’s expenses during the period when he was unemployed. He emphasises that this was so that the family’s standard of living remained unaffected, and points out that he has repaid $40,000 to the Wife sometime in 2007. The Husband also argues that, in addition to the money in the cash box, he provided an allowance to the Wife of $300 a month up to 2017, and then $1100 a month after that. I accept the Husband’s case that the borrowings were for the family’s benefit.

21     Regarding the children, the Husband admits that he was unable to maintain the children after he lost his employment as a rubber trader in 2009. He claims, however, that he provided them with pocket money throughout university. Contrary to this, the Wife claims that she was the “sole party” that financially supported the daughter’s 4-year university studies at the National University of Singapore costing $22,896, as well as an exchange programme in Sweden costing $18,000. She also claims that she solely financially supported the son’s university education in the United Kingdom costing approximately $230,000, and his Parts A and B examinations costing $8,346. She claims that the Husband ceased to maintain the children after they completed junior college. The Husband denies this; but the children have deposed affidavits to confirm it. On a balance of probabilities, I accept the Wife’s version on this as true.

22     The Husband’s counsel submits that the court ought to attribute the parties’ indirect contributions at 50% each.

23     The Wife’s counsel submits that it should be 80% to the Wife. This figure is pegged to the decision in _Twiss Christopher James Hans v Twiss Yvonne Prendergast_[^3]. In that case the Court found that the Wife’s indirect contribution was 75%. That was a case of a 20-year marriage. The parties’ indirect contributions in the first decade were roughly equal. In the second decade the wife’s indirect contributions was found to have far exceeded the husband’s due to his physical absence from the family. The Wife’s counsel seeks to distinguish that case by saying that in the present case, the Wife’s contribution was more than the wife in _Twiss v Twiss_. According to her, unlike in _Twiss v Twiss_, this is a longer marriage, and that the length of the Wife being the sole homemaker is substantially longer.

24     The Wife also presented a case of substantial indirect contributions. She gave up her full time job, which she described as an “ACU-Forex Trading/Processing Team”. Obviously, it does not mean that she was a one-person team, and there is nothing in evidence to illustrate what that job was, and what her career trajectory was. Consequently, it is not possible for this Court to plumb the extent of her career sacrifice. What is clear, however, is that she did give up a career to care for the family.

25     The parties admit that the Wife was a stay home parent, and that this was a mutual understanding. At the same time, the Husband was the providing parent, and this was mutually agreed.

26     Both parties hurl numerous other complaints against each other. I do not need to make findings on every individual allegation, and will not do so. Instead, I apply applied a broad-brush approach to the issue. I find against the Husband’s submission that the indirect contributions of the parties are equal. The totality of the evidence shows that there is an imbalance in indirect contributions to the household in favour of the Wife.

27     The next question is how much the imbalance is. I considered the cases referred to by both learned counsel. It must be borne in mind that although these cases have parallels to, and divergences from, the present case, I regarded them all in the contexts of their own sets of facts.

28     I find that the facts of the case of _UNE v UNF[^4]_ are not very useful here, as the wife in that case was not a full time home maker for 16 out of 29 years of the marriage, as in the present case. Other factors were taken into account, which led to the court’s conclusion that her indirect contributions were 75%. Clearly that case does not stand for the singular principle that a marriage of 29 years by itself attracts an indirect contribution value of 75%.

29     The case of _UAP v UAQ[^5]_ is that of a 22-year marriage where the wife was found to have made indirect contribution of 80%. I find that case distinguishable on its facts. The court in that case found the high value of indirect contribution by the wife due to the serious sacrifices that she had made. Similarly, that case does not stand as authority that a 22-year marriage, by that fact alone, attracts an indirect contribution value of 80%.

30     The aforementioned case of _Twiss v Twiss_ is that of a 20-year marriage where the wife was found to have made indirect contribution of 75%. I find that case has several points of distinction from the present one. It was a shorter marriage, and the husband left the family.

31     Other than that, I find that the 75% of that case is a useful benchmark nevertheless. In other words, due to the marriage here being longer than in _Twiss v Twiss_, the Wife’s indirect contribution here would be worth more than 75%, and I find that it ought to be 80%. However, because the Husband is not absent in this case as the husband was in _Twiss v Twiss_, the Husband’s indirect contributions here is more, and I find that addition to be 10%. This results in an increase of the Husband’s indirect contribution from 20% to 30%.

32     I therefore find the second ratio prescribed by _ANJ v_ ANK between the Husband and the Wife to be 30:70.

### Average ratio and result

33     Thirdly, as prescribed by _ANJ v ANK_, I then averaged the two ratios to derive each party’s overall contribution to the family.

34     The Husband’s counsel submits that the Court ought to give equal weights to the direct and indirect contributions, because this is a long marriage, with fully-grown children, because the Husband was undisputedly the sole breadwinner, and because the pool of assets is not extraordinarily large.

35     Following this argument, and based on my findings above, if the direct and indirect contributions of the parties are given equal weight, the result will be that each party will receive as follows-

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="33.36%"> <col width="32.88%"> <col width="33.76%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="b" colspan="3" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Where direct and indirect contributions have equal weight</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Husband</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">47%</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$493,238.68</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Wife</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">53%</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$556,205.32</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

36     As can be seen above, equal weightage of the two heads of contributions will yield in a 6% difference in favour of the Wife, or an additional $62,966.64.

37     The Wife’s counsel submits that the Court ought to give a higher weight to the indirect contributions, because the Wife sacrificed her own career progression to care for the family, that she was the primary caregiver of the children, that she used her own savings to assist the children, and that she used her own savings to assist the Husband.

38     I did not disregard these factors, but they had already been taken into account in my finding of the Wife’s indirect contributions being 70%. I do not think that they ought to be counted again at this stage of the exercise.

39     That having been said, I do not think that the ratio between direct and indirect contributions ought to be equal in the present case. I take into account other relevant factors that, to me, tilt the weight in favour of indirect contributions.

40     Firstly, I take into account that the Wife has no income, and realistically, no future earning capacity[^6].

41     Secondly, I take into account that the Wife is set to lose the financial support that she would otherwise receive from the Husband. It is open to the court to order the Husband to pay maintenance to her. However, I take into account his age, and that he would have his hands full to support his own household after the matrimonial flat is sold. Therefore, I find that it is more just and practical for the Wife to be given a larger share of the assets as a whole, and obviate the need for a separate order of maintenance. In doing so, I take into account the maintenance of the Wife during this exercise of division of assets[^7].

42     Thirdly, I consider the possibility of separately ordering a lump sum of maintenance for the Wife. The Wife prays for lump sum maintenance of $129,600. She arrives at this figure based on the formula given in _Wan Lai Cheng v Quek Seow Kee[^8]_ to arrive at a multiplier of 12 years. She argues that the multiplicand should be $900 a month. I am unable to see how the Husband, who is a 68-year old private hire vehicle driver bringing home roughly $3,000 a month, can realistically be expected to support himself after paying the Wife $900 every month, after the divorce. I find this to be an excessively oppressive and potentially crushing sum, and instead find that the sum should be $375 a month. In addition, one cannot reasonably expect the Husband to continue for long in a vocation that involves the continuous driving of a vehicle for more than 12 hours every day. In my view, the formula used in _Wan Lai Cheng_ is not meant for cases where husbands are of post-retirement age. Using the formula, one ends up assuming that the Husband would be able to maintain the Wife until the age of 80 years old. This is unlikely in the present case. Consequently, I order that the future maintenance in the amount of $54,000 be credited to the Wife in advance, in the form of a larger share of the matrimonial assets.

43     In view of the foregoing, I find that in the overall circumstances of the case, the direct and indirect contributions have respective weights of 35:65. The value of $54,000 I stated above is included and rounded off. The consequence is that the Wife will receive an additional value of $53,522 more than if the direct and indirect contributions are given equal weight. Attributing this weightage will result in the Wife’s need for maintenance to be completely obviated.

## Conclusion on division of assets

44     First, I allocate the assets in sole names between the parties as follows–

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="0"><colgroup><col width="47.32%"> <col width="28.96%"> <col width="23.72%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Assets in sole names</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Value</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Party to get</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">CPF savings of the Husband</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$51,752.47</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Husband</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Bank accounts of the Husband</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$14,896.15</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Husband</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Husband Total</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$66,648.62</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">CPF savings of the Wife</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$18,415.68</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Wife</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Bank accounts of the Wife</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$9,835.06</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Wife</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Shares of the Wife</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$545.16</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Wife</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Wife Total</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$28,795.90</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

45     Then I deal with the flat, which has a value of $954,000. In order to achieve each party’s share of the total matrimonial asset pool, they have to sell the flat, and allocate the sale proceeds such that each of them will receive the following shares from it.

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="19.0838167633527%"> <col width="21.9043808761752%"> <col width="20.4640928185637%"> <col width="18.6837367473495%"> <col width="19.8639727945589%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Party</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Share of total asset pool</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Already in own name</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Share of the flat</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Percentage</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Husband</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$439,717</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$66,648.62</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$373,068</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">39.1%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Wife</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$609,727</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$28,795.90</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$580,932</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">60.9%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Total</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$1,049,444</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$95,444</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$954,000</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">100%</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

46     Once the parties carry out the order, the Husband will be left with $439,717 worth of assets. $51,752.47 will be in his CPF account, $14,896.15 in his bank accounts, and $373,068 from the sale proceeds. He will probably be able to purchase a 2-room HDB flat. He gets a clean break from the Wife, as he no longer has to maintain her every month. As his children have grown up and appear to be employed, he may, if need be, look to them for maintenance under the Maintenance of Parents Act. I am satisfied that this is an adequate provision to tide him over the dissolution of his marriage, and enable him to start a new life.
