variation – care and control – maintenance

15 February 2021

### District Judge Suzanne Chin:

## Introduction

1       On 13 February 2020, the Defendant father (“Father”) filed a summons for variation of the current care and control orders, requesting the court to grant shared care and control of the child. He also applied to vary the earlier maintenance orders to reflect the relevant change of care and control arrangements if his application were to be successful.

2       After hearing from the parties and considering all of the evidence before me, I called for a Custody Evaluation Report (“CER”) to assist me and provide further insight into the facts and circumstances of the case. My final decision on the matter was delivered on 17 December 2020 after the CER was made available to me and I made the following orders:

> _1_.     _That paragraph 3(b) of the ORC date 19 August 2016 be varied by substituting the following:_

>> (_b)(i_)   _That the parties shall be granted shared care and control to the child with the child spending the following times with the Father:_

>>> _Phase 1 - Up to 31 January 2021_

>>> _\-_      _Every Monday and Wednesday from after school or 3pm (during school holidays) to 7.30pm;_

>>> _\-_      _Every Friday after school or 3pm (during school holidays) to Saturday 6pm with effect from 25th December 2020;_

>>> _\-_      _From 10am to 6pm on public holidays on an alternating basis commencing from Christmas day in 2020._

>> _For each access session, the Defendant is to pick the child (without the Plaintiff’s helper) from the Plaintiff’s residence and return the child to the Plaintiff’s residence._

>>> _Phase 2 - From 1 February 2021 to 31 March 2021_

>>> _\-_      _Every Monday from after school to 7.30pm;_

>>> _\-_      _Every Thursday after school to Saturday 6pm;_

>>> _\-_      _From 10 am to 6pm on public holidays on an alternating basis._

>> _For each access session, the Defendant is to pick the child (without the Plaintiff’s helper) from the Plaintiff’s residence and return the child to the Plaintiff’s residence._

>>> _From 1 April 2021_

>>> _\-_      _Every Wednesday after school to Saturday 6pm._

>>> _\-_      _From 10am to 6pm on public holidays on an alternating basis._

>>> _\-_      _Half of the mid-year and year end school holidays on an alternating basis commencing with the 1st half of the June and December school holidays in 2021._

> _The Parent with care and control shall pick the child from the other parent’s residence._

>> _b(ii_)     _Starting from 1 June 2021, parties shall be at liberty to bring the child overseas twice yearly to a maximum of 14 days per trip during their half of the school holidays, including over Christmas and New Year subject to no less than 1 months’ notice of the trip (location and dates) being provided to the other parent. Flight and accommodation details including contact details are to be provided no less than 10 days prior to departure date._

>> _b(iii_)     _Parties to attend counselling at DSSA._

> _2_.     _That paragraph 3(e) of the ORC date 19 August 2016 be varied by substituting the following:_

>> (_e_)     _From 1 April 2021, each party is to maintain the child when in their respective care provided that the parties shall share equally school fees, medical, dental and insurance and mutually agreed upon extra-curricular activities. The party who incurred the expense shall provide relevant receipts to the other party who shall reimburse the relevant sums within 14 days into the relevant bank accounts as notified to the other party._

3       The Wife has filed an appeal against all of my orders and I now set forth below the reasons for my decision.

## Background facts

4       The parties married in May 2010 and moved to Singapore in 2012. The Father is an expatriate in Singapore while the Mother is a Singaporean. In March 2015, the Mother left the matrimonial home taking the child who at the time had not even turned one. Shortly thereafter in April of 2015, she commenced divorce proceedings. This led to cross applications filed by each of the parties for interim custody, care and control and access. The matter came before me for hearing. Taking into consideration the age of the child, I made orders granting interim joint custody of the child to the parties with sole care and control to the Mother and access to the Father with the Mother’s domestic helper who had been looking after the child since birth accompanying the child. I made it clear at the time that my orders were not supervised access orders but was intended to provide the Father with an extra pair of hands in taking care of a very young child.

5       The final ancillaries were heard by me on 28 June 2016 when the child was two years old and I confirmed the interim orders previously made with some modifications in turns of the timings for access (“2016 Orders”). The Father appealed against the 2016 Orders but his appeal was dismissed. Since then the 2016 Orders have continued.

## The Father’s application and his reasons

6       The Father maintained that the Mother had refused to allow him to have any unsupervised time with the child and had not readily shared information pertaining to the child’s welfare with him. As a result, he felt that he had been deprived of alone time with the child as his time had been restricted and inhibited by the presence of the Mother’s domestic helper. Accordingly, he had not had the chance to bond with her freely. He argued that there had been a material change of circumstances warranting a variation of the orders on care and control and access by virtue of the fact that the child was now 6 years old and was more independent. He also argued that by her actions the Mother had interfered with the bond between the Father and the child and the 2016 Orders put the Father in a subservient position vis-a-vis the Mother.

## The Mother’s position

7       The Mother was of the view that the Father’s application was without merit and that there had been no material change in circumstances warranting a variation of the 2016 Orders. She argued further that the variation sought was not in the child’s best interests. It was her position that the 2016 Orders had provided the child with ample time to spend with the Father in the company of the helper and this had resulted in the child feeling safe, secure and stable. She wanted these orders to continue without variation. She disagreed with the Father’s views on her co-parenting efforts and explained that she had done her best to co-parent with the Husband by allowing him more time to spend with the child even beyond what had been ordered by the 2016 Orders. She had also kept the Father informed of matters relating to the child’s education, health and well-being and had even organised joint holidays such that both parties went to the same holiday destination thus allowing the Father continued access with the child during these holidays. It was her position however that the Husband continued with his aggressive and harassing behaviour constantly harassing her to change the 2016 Orders by agreement and trying to unilaterally force the changes by preventing the Wife’s domestic helper from accompanying the child during access. She also maintained that he continued to have anger management issues and hence a variation of the 2016 orders would not be in the child’s best interests.

## The Law on Variation of Care and Control

8       Section 128 of the Women’s Charter states as follows:

> “The court may at any time vary or rescind any order for the custody, or the care and control, of a child on the application of any interested person, where it is satisfied that the order was based on any misrepresentation or mistake of fact or where there has been any material change of circumstances.”

9       In addition to s 128 of the Women’s Charter, s 125 refers to the paramount consideration on issues relating to the custody and care and control of the child as the welfare of the child. The burden of proving a material change rests on the party who applies for such a variation and even if there has been a material change in circumstances, the primary consideration remains the welfare of the child. (_APK v APL_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGHC 255</span> at paragraph 19).

## Material Change in Circumstances

10     The Father was seeking to vary the 2016 Orders which were made when the child was 2 years of age on the basis that there had been a material change of circumstances in that the child was now older – almost 7 years of age.

11     In **_AZB v AZC_** **<span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHCF 1</span>**, the High Court at \[28\] referred to Professor Leong Wai Kum’s explanation of the underlying basis for the court’s power to vary or discharge a custody, care and control and access order:

> “\[28\] …. Professor Leong explains the underlying basis for the court’s power to vary or discharge a custody, care and control and access order (Leong Wai Kum, _Principles of Family Law in Singapore_ (Butterworths Asia, 1997) at p 584):

>> An order of ‘care and control’, ‘custody’ or ‘access’ is of continuing nature. Indeed, unless the order expressly limits its duration, any of these orders lasts until the infant ceases to be an infant … upon his or her 21st birthday. A continuing order is always subject to variation or even discharge. Whenever an application is made to court that circumstances have changed and in particular, _the welfare of the infant is no longer as well served by the order, there is opportunity for consideration of variation of any or all of its terms and, if necessary, its discharge. “_

\[emphasis added\]

The learned Judicial Commissioner Debbie Ong (as she then was) went on to further comment as follows:

> “\[32\] Relationships are dynamic. A parent who is not emotionally close to a child at the time an access order is made may, through time, build a much closer relationship with the child subsequently. For example, a young three-year old child may have been clingy to his mother at the time the court orders care and control to the mother and limited access to the father. As the child grows older and builds a closer relationship with his father, it may be in his welfare to encourage increased access when he is, say, five years old. The child may have outgrown the phase of high dependence on and clinginess to his mother. There may not have been any one particular identifiable event that marks a material change in circumstances between the time he was three and five years old, but because relationships are dynamic, circumstances may have sufficiently changed such that a variation is warranted for his welfare. Hence, the court ought not to read s 128 of the Women’s Charter too narrowly, but should take both a principled and pragmatic approach to the determination of a material change in circumstances.”

12     It was clear to me that in this case, the child had outgrown the 2016 Orders. A child of two is clearly at a different stage of life from a child of close to seven. As with relationships, the needs of a child are dynamic and change over time. A younger child of two may need security and stability and care and control and access arrangements would reflect those needs of the child at the time but the needs of a seven year old who is older and at a more independent stage of life may be different. In light of this, I accepted that there had been a material change in circumstances justifying a relook at the 2016 Orders.

## Factors considered in determining the best interests of the Child

#### 2016 Orders and interference with the parent child bond

13     The 2016 Orders provided for the Mother’s domestic helper to accompany the child during access at the time when the child was two. As mentioned above, that decision had been made taking into consideration the age of the child at the time and the fact that the Father had little experience in taking care of the child on his own. Accordingly, it was considered that an extra pair of hands would be helpful in assisting the Father. It was however made clear to the parties that the orders were not orders for supervised access. When the matter was considered on appeal in the High Court before the Honourable Justice Debbie Ong in August 2016, the Mother herself had recognised and acknowledged that the access arrangements may have to change when the child turns 5 and is older. It was further noted that as the child grew older, it might be a more suitable for the Father to have more access to the child, whether unsupervised, overnight and/or overseas access. The parties were also encouraged to try to work out and agree between themselves access arrangements as the child grew older.

14     Notwithstanding that the intent of the 2016 Orders had been clearly conveyed to the parties, the Mother has operated and continues to operate as though the orders were in fact supervised access orders. This has led to her insistence that the Father’s access to the child always be in the presence of her domestic helper. She has on occasion allowed the Father access to the child on some of his access sessions but on her condition that access must take place within the compound of her condominium. While the Mother argues that she has granted to the Father more access than the 2016 Orders had prescribed even taking joint holidays together, I noted that the Father’s access was always subject to the conditions imposed by the Mother and on her terms. Additionally, even if the 2016 Orders of accompanied access were to have been considered as orders for supervised access, which they are not, it is generally accepted that supervised access should not continue indefinitely. Barring safety concerns, once a child establishes a relationship and bonds with the parent having access, the supervised access can and should be lifted. In this case, notwithstanding the constraints, the Father has worked hard within the constraints of the 2016 Orders and has been able to establish a reasonable bond with the child, one that can as best be established when there is always another person present during his access with the child. This insistence by the Mother of the child’s access with the Father always taking place in the presence of her domestic helper and always on her terms and her reluctance to try to work out and agree on modified access arrangements for the Father has however restricted and interfered with the development of the parent child bond. It would accordingly not be in the best interests of the child for such restricted access to continue.

#### Safety Concerns

15     It was noted further, that apart from the suggestion by the Mother that the Father has a bad-temper and this has resulted in the child being fearful of him, she made no real allegations of any risk of danger to the child. Incidentally, these contentions of the child being fearful towards the Father, were not in any way borne out in the relevant CER. While the Mother did raise various incidents where she claimed that the Father had been aggressive, confrontational and had lost his temper, I noted that even if I were to accept the Mother’s assertions at their highest, in none of these situations, was the aggression directed at the child nor was the child put in any danger. Upon close examination of all f the evidence before me, I accepted the Father’s explanations of these various incidents. I also found that in the instances cited by the Mother where the Father had been perceived as being aggressive towards the Mother’s domestic helper, these likely stemmed from the Father’s frustration over being restricted in his access to the child. It was accordingly evident to the court that there were no safety concerns in relation to the child.

#### Need for accompanied access to continue

16     As the child is now older, the Father is more than able to take care of the child on his own and does not really require any assistance or support of the Mother’s domestic helper. Having the Mother’s domestic helper always in tow, would not allow the Father the freedom to establish and nurture his relationship with the child. I also noted that the Father has hired his own domestic helper with whom the child has spent time and is familiar with. If any support is required in taking care of the child, the Father’s domestic helper will be there to provide this. As such I arrived at the decision that there was no longer any need for the child to be accompanied by the Mother’s domestic helper during her access with the Father.

## Shared Care and Control and best interests of the child

17     In **_TAU v TAT_** **<span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHCF 11</span>**, the High Court noted as follows:

> “\[17\] There is thus neither any legal principle against shared care and control, nor a legal presumption that this arrangement is always in a child’s welfare. Where such an arrangement is suitable for a child in his or her developmental stage of life, considering his or her relationship with each parent and all relevant circumstances, such an order may be made for the child’s welfare. Whatever the arrangements ultimately made, parents must recognise that they must “place the needs of their children before their own”

18     Taking into consideration all of the facts and circumstances of this case as well as the age of the child and her responses to the past arrangements since the divorce and taking into consideration the best interests of the child which is paramount, I was of the view that it was in the child’s best interests for the parties to be granted shared care and control of the child.

#### Both parents to be involved in the child’s life

19     One of the relevant factors to consider when determining the best interests of the child was the need for both parents to be involved in a child’s life. The 2016 Orders restricted the Father’s involvement in the child’s life and I was of the view that a shared care and control arrangement would provide the child with the opportunity to have uninterrupted and balanced access to both parents. This is a child from dual nationality parents and being a product of two cultures, it would be in her welfare to be given every opportunity to understand and experience both of these cultures and to build strong familial ties with both of her extended families. This has not been the case in the past where the child has been restricted in her access to the Father and also his family. The child has only been given the opportunity to bond and spend time with her maternal side of the family. The shared care and control arrangement will facilitate the building of strong parent and child bonds with both parents, something which will be beneficial to the child in the long run. In this regard, it is noted that social science studies have shown that maintaining a close degree of contact with both parents is associated with better academic, emotional, behavioural and other outcomes for a child.

20     The child is also extremely close to the Mother and by the Mother’s submissions is very dependant on her and the domestic helper to provide comfort and security. The mother herself acknowledges this and indicates that the child needs to sleep with her every night in order to feel safe and secure. While this may have been appropriate and beneficial for the child up to now, the child is entering a stage of her life where such high dependence and clinginess would not necessarily be in her best interests. She should be encouraged to be more independent.

21     I also noted that current arrangements may also have led to the child forming negative impressions of the Father based on her perceptions of the views of her Mother. The Mother’s distrust of the Father appears to have been picked up by the child and has placed the child in a position where she feels the need to show her loyalties towards one parent over the other. Longer term, this will not have a positive impact on the child and will certainly hinder the building of a bond between father and child. An order of shared care and control will send a clear message and will emphasize to the parties the importance for both parents playing significant and complimentary roles in the child’s life and the need for them to co-parent. The child will also come to realise that she is the child of both parents and will insulate her from being put in a stressful situation of having to choose between parents.

#### Caregiving capacities of each parent

22     It was clear that both parents loved the child dearly and wanted what was best for her.

23     It is not disputed that the Mother has had the sole care and control of the child to date and has been the child’s main caregiver. The child has grown up at six and a half to be fairly well adjusted although as mentioned above, there is some evidence pointing to the fact that the child is heavily influenced by the views of the Mother in her impressions of the Father. This may not have been the result of any conscious act by the Mother but does not bode well for the child both in the immediate term and in the long run.

24     Although the Father’s time with the child has been fairly limited and has always been in the presence of the Mother’s domestic helper, he appears to have worked hard to establish a bond with the child. The evidence shows that despite the limited access he has enjoyed, he has made complied with the 2016 Orders and has made efforts that show that he wants to be actively involved in the parenting of the child as well as her education.

25     Based on observations, it was clear that neither party lacked the capacity to parent the child. From the evidence before me, I noted that both parents were committed to ensuring the child’s well-being and both had the ability to provide a nurturing environment to meet her day to day as well as emotional needs. As the Father has demonstrated through the years his desire to be more actively involved in the child’s life, I saw this as a positive development for the child. To have the attention of both parents who were prepared to devote time and attention to cater to her needs and sow into her life would certainly be of benefit to the child.

#### Ability to co-parent

26     While the parties may have thought that they were unable to co-parent, it is important to note that both had a strong understanding of the importance of co-parenting. Their co-parenting efforts to date appear to have been hindered by the differences in communication styles, personal anxieties resulting from a lack of trust as well as the difficulties in coming to mutual agreement on modified access arrangements. Both however appeared to some degree, to recognise the importance for the child having both parents in her life and but each had their own ideas of what this would mean in practical terms. With these attitudes, it was assessed that the prognosis for co-parenting was good subject to their being provided with further support to assist them in their co-parenting efforts. In this regard I made further orders for the parties to attend counselling in order to improve communication and to help them co-parent the child.

#### Workability of shared care and control

27     I determined that the child is at an appropriate stage of her life where this shared arrangement will be workable and would not interfere with her educational needs. Before this when she was younger, it was assessed that she was too young for this shared arrangement as she needed consistency and stability. While there is the argument to be made that that same stability and consistency should continue for educational outcomes, I was of the view that this new arrangement would in fact provide a new consistency and stability to the child which would be in her best interests. I was however mindful of introducing changes too abruptly and upon consideration of the child’s best interests, took into consideration the need for time to be given for the child to adjust to the new arrangements.

28     The child is attending an international school and both parents appear to be very invested in her educational needs. Both parents work but it was clear that each had the flexibility in their work schedules to find the necessary time to support the child in her educational and emotional needs. This shared care and control arrangement will be in the child’s welfare as it would allow her to enjoy to the fullest extent, a life with both of her parents.

## Variation of maintenance orders

29     Following from my orders on the shared care and control arrangement, I varied the maintenance orders such that each party would bear their share of the child’s expenses when the child was in their care and control but would share all other common expenses like the child’s school fees equally.

## Conclusion

30     It was for the above reasons that I made my orders. In all cases where a child is involved, the welfare and interests of the child is considered paramount. In this case, after considering all of the facts of the case and having reviewed the findings of the CER, I reached the conclusion that the welfare and interests of the child would be best served by sending a strong signal to both parties that, as parents, they had to work together for the sake of their child and that the court would not permit either of them to exclude or restrict the other from their child’s lives.

31     To ensure that the arrangements would not be abruptly implemented, my orders outlined a step-up approach which progressively increased the child’s access to the Father so as to allow time for her to gradually adapt to the changes in her current routine.
