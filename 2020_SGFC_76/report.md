Family Law – Ancillary Matters

Family Law – Pleadings – Party seeking to depart from reliefs prayed in Statement of Claim

15 September 2020

### District Judge Azmin Jailani:

## Introduction

1       This decision relates to the court’s determination of the ancillary matters (“AM”) for D 4250/2017 (“D 4250”).

2       By way of background, I granted the plaintiff-wife’s application for a judgment of judicial separation in D 4250 on 1 October 2018. The defendant-husband appealed against that decision, the full grounds of which are found in my decision in _USC v USD_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGFC 6</span> (_“USC”_). In _USC_, I had discussed the multitude of points raised by the plaintiff in respect of the defendant’s unreasonable behaviour (see, _inter alia_, \[59\] to \[193\] of _USC_). For the present purpose, it suffices to state that I was satisfied that the defendant’s cumulative conduct towards the plaintiff was objectively unsustainable for _any_ relationship, let also his relationship with the plaintiff.

3       After _USC_ was released, the defendant withdrew his appeal in respect of the judgment of judicial separation.

4       In addition to my decision on judicial separation, _USC_ also dealt with the defendant’s appeals relating for two related applications – OSG 61/xxxx (“OSG 61”) and OSG 2/xxxx (“OSG 2”). OSG 61 and OSG 2 were cross applications by parties in respect of, among other things, care and control, access, and maintenance of the two children[^1] of the marriage. As I had explained in _USC_, the interplay between D 4250, OSG 61 and OSG 2 was such that while the orders made in respect of the children in OSG 61 and OSG 2 were final orders, they were ‘temporary’ in that they may, depending on circumstances, be modified with the final ancillary orders in D 4250.

5       As I noted earlier, the defendant withdrew his appeal against the judgment of judicial separation, but maintained his appeal in respect of OSG 61 and OSG 2. At the conclusion of those appeals[^2], certain appeal orders were made (the “Appeal Orders”). The Appeal Orders are relevant to these proceedings because at the hearings of the ancillary matters, parties agreed to be bound by the Appeal Orders in respect of the Children:

> (a)     custody[^3];

> (b)     care and control[^4];

> (c)     access;

> (d)     maintenance (to the extent that the defendant was to maintain \[E\] as she was under his care and control); and

> (e)     certain other supplementary orders relating to, among other things, parties undergoing counselling to “improve co-parenting work and the parent-child relationship”.

6       In light of the above, what was left to be determined for the purposes of the ancillary matters essentially related to:

> (a)     the identification and division of the matrimonial assets;

> (b)     spousal maintenance for the plaintiff, and

> (c)     child maintenance (to the extent the plaintiff had care and control of \[T\]).

7       After hearing parties and considering the matter, I made the following orders (and set out my broad reasons for the same):

> (a)     First, that the plaintiff be awarded 55% of the identified pool of matrimonial assets (with the defendant being awarded 45%);

> (b)     second, that the defendant pay the plaintiff monthly maintenance of $2,300 for \[T\];[^5]

> (c)     third, that the defendant pays the plaintiff monthly spousal maintenance of $2,500. Additionally, I ordered that the order of maintenance be backdated to the time the judgment of judicial separation was made (ie, 1 October 2018); and

> (d)     fourth, that there be certain supplementary orders to ensure harmonisation with the Appeal Orders parties agreed to be bound to.

> (the “AM Orders”)

8       After issuing my AM Orders, I invited parties to first attempt to arrive at an agreement on the consequential orders for division (ie, which specific assets are to be divided, and how they were to be divided), maintenance (ie, calculation and repayment of arrears), and costs. If parties were not able to reach an agreement, they were to submit their submissions setting out their position on the aforementioned matter.

9       Before the timelines for submissions had expired, the defendant filed his appeal against the AM Orders. On that basis, I now set the full grounds of my decision.

## Brief Procedural History after the AM Orders

10     Much of parties’ backgrounds and the breakdown of their relationship has been set out in fairly extensive detail in _USC_. As such, I do not propose to rehash those points again. As mentioned earlier, I had considered the numerous contentions made by the plaintiff against the defendant’s conduct (including the defendant’s conduct in his application for a stay of execution pending the appeal of D 4250, OSG 61 and OSG 2). I was satisfied that the defendant’s conduct, at least vis-à-vis the plaintiff, was sufficiently wanting and clearly indicative of a irretrievable breakdown of the marriage.

11     I also highlighted some reservations I had with the _manner_ in which the defendant presented his case and how he sought to leverage his position during those proceedings.[^6]

12     For the purposes of this judgment, I first touch on what took place _after_ the defendant filed his appeal against the AM Orders.

### FC/SUM 361/20200

13     After filing his appeal against the AM Orders, the defendant also, as with the earlier set of orders I made, sought a stay of execution of the AM Orders pending the disposal of the appeal (_vide_ SUM 361/2020, or “SUM 361”).

14     After hearing parties, I made the following orders:

> (a)     I granted a stay of execution of the AM Orders dealing with the _identification and division of matrimonial assets_.

> (b)     I granted a stay of execution of the AM Orders dealing with the _plaintiff’s spousal maintenance_ on condition that the defendant pay the plaintiff the sum of $20,000; and

> (c)     I made no orders in respect of the defendant’s application to stay of execution of _child maintenance payments for \[T\]_. This was on the basis that first, the defendant had actually been making payments of the maintenance orders in the Appeal Orders. Second, parties were able to come to a consensus on the arrears of \[T\]’s maintenance for the months of February 2020 and March 2020. The upshot of this was that the _children’s financial requirements_, as envisaged under the AM Orders, were being met. As such, there was no real necessity to make any substantive orders on whether the AM Orders relating to \[T\]’s maintenance ought to be stayed. For clarity, this means that the AM Orders relating to child maintenance remain in force.

## Main Issues Arising in This Decision

15     As alluded to above, in light of the appeal orders, the main issues for determination relate to:

> (a)     The identification and division of the matrimonial assets;

> (b)     Maintenance for the plaintiff; and

> (c)     Maintenance for \[T\].

16     I deal with each of these issues in turn below.

## Analysis and Findings

### Identification, Valuation, and Division of Matrimonial Assets

17     Parties broad positions on the issue of division can be seen in their respective ancillary fact and position sheets.[^7]

18     At the outset, parties were _ad idem_ insofar as there be a division of the matrimonial home (but the proportion and manner of division was disputed).

19     Where parties significantly differed was the division of the matrimonial assets _other than the matrimonial home_. On one hand, the plaintiff sought a division of those assets.[^8] On the other hand, the defendant’s position was that each party were to keep their own assets acquired before or during the marriage in their own names.

20     Significantly, the defendant adopted this position because it was “in agreement with the Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim”.[^9]

21     The upshot of this was the suggestion that the plaintiff had, _in her own pleadings[^10], prayed for such relief_. Whilst the plaintiff’s counsel, Ms Huang, did not substantively dispute that the language of her pleadings suggested this, she sought to persuade this court to depart from the terms of the plaintiff’s pleadings.

22     After considering parties submissions, I was not inclined to accept the defendant’s submissions, and determined that I was allowed, under the circumstances of this case and on the wording of section 112(2) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353) (“WC”), to assess the matrimonial pool of assets _in its entirety_ for the purposes of division.

#### Was the Plaintiff Limited to the Reliefs as Prayed in her Statement of Claim?

23     I first start with the plaintiff’s statement of claim. At \[7(d)\] and \[7(e)\] of the plaintiff’s SOCA1, the plaintiff specifically prayed for the following reliefs in _terms of division_:

> 7 Relief Claimed

> …

> (d)     Division of matrimonial home

> That there be a just and equitable division of the matrimonial flat situated at and known as \[Property P\] (the “Matrimonial Flat”) **and the matrimonial assets.**

> (e)     Division of the matrimonial assets (aside from the matrimonial home)

> **Parties are to retain all other assets in their own names**… (emphasis added)

24     I first observe that the lack of clarity in the plaintiff’s drafting was regrettable. The issue with the plaintiff’s drafting was, in my view, further exacerbated by the fact that the manner in which she pleaded her reliefs replicated Form 6 (the applicable form as stated in the Family Justice Rules (“FJR”) for a statement of claim).

25     At this point, it bears mentioning that the forms to be filled by parties, especially in family proceedings are, in my view, exceedingly facilitative to the point that they go into very specific detail of the information which the court requires in adjudicating the dispute. As I mentioned earlier, the plaintiff replicated the structure of Form 6[^11], which is the required form for the statement of claim under Rule 44(a) FJR.

26     In section 7 of Form 6, under the heading entitled “Relief Claimed”, a clear distinction is made between, on one hand, the “division of the matrimonial home” (section 7(d)), and on the other, the “division of the matrimonial assets (other than the matrimonial home)” (section 7(e)).

27     The language of what the above section of Form 6 seeks for parties to apply their minds to could not be any clearer.

28     Each field of entry requires the party to apply their mind to a specific aspect of the proceedings to ensure a holistic conclusion of this matter. This is not a matter of happenstance, but a conscious attempt to ensure that parties apply their mind, in a structure fashion, to a specific aspect of the proceedings. This ensures the holistic determination of the matter. This is consistent with the notions of therapeutic justice, where the orders made at the end of the proceedings is not merely the end, but a new start for parties.

29     This deliberate structure is also not surprising, given the well-accepted reality that a significant proportions of the litigants in family proceedings are self-represented. Needless to say, if parties were represented, the structure of the form focuses counsels minds as to what they need to advise their clients on.

30     On that basis, it appeared to be relatively clear, as Mr Liew submitted, that the plaintiff sought a division of the matrimonial home, but intended for parties to retain their other assets.

31     However, in seeking to persuade me to divide the entirety of the matrimonial assets, against the prayers sought in SOCA1, Ms Huang put forward the following arguments:

> (a)     First, while she accepted the clear words of her prayer at \[7(e)\] SOCA1, she brought to my attention that the plaintiff had, in her 1st Affidavit of Assets and Means (“P1AOM”), apparently clarified that:

>> In respect of the other matrimonial assets, I am requesting for a just and equitable division, including the making of the necessary orders under section 112 of the Women’s Charter for the \[d\]efendant to transfer amounts from his CPF amounts to my CPF accounts

> In short, Ms Huang sought to persuade me that by virtue of P1AOM, the plaintiff had ‘amended’ her pleadings to clarify the relief sought in respect of the other matrimonial assets. At the hearing, I queried Ms Huang as to whether there was any difficulty in actually applying for a formal amendment of the pleading to properly clarify that position. Ms Huang was not able to provide me with a satisfactory response.

> (b)     Second, Ms Huang sought to rationalise her pleading (specifically \[7(d)\] SOCA1) such that while the focus was to divide the matrimonial home, it was necessary for the court to determine the division of the other assets _if_ the defendant was unable to fully provide the plaintiff the value of her share of the matrimonial home.

> (c)     Third, and perhaps the most straightforward submission, was that at the time the plaintiff filed the writ of judicial separation, she was unaware of the full extent of the defendant’s other assets, and simply prayed that each party were to retain their own assets.

> (d)     Fourth, and notwithstanding the state of the plaintiff’s pleadings, the defendant would have been aware that the division of parties’ other matrimonial assets became ‘live’ after, _inter alia_, (i) the statement made in the plaintiff’s 1st Affidavit of Assets and Means, (ii) parties’ exchange of their respective discovery requests, and (iii) certain discovery orders were made against the defendant to disclose his other assets on 17 April 2019. At this juncture, it also bears mentioning that the defendant had, in March 2019, sought discovery of, among other things, the plaintiff’s “membership in \[C\] Club and the value of the club membership”. The basis for the request was:

>> \[To relate\] to assessment of \[the\] \[p\]laintiff’s means and needs **and division of assets**

>> (emphasis added)

> Further, in his 2nd Affidavit of Assets and Means (“D2AOM”), the defendant contended on how certain assets ought to be excluded from the pool. In short, the main thrust of the plaintiff’s argument was that despite the prayers in SOCA1, the defendant was not denied natural justice, and had a reasonable opportunity to substantively address the plaintiff’s ‘revised’ case for a division of the other matrimonial assets. Further, by substantively responding and somewhat participating on such issues, it could not be said that the defendant was completely caught off-guard that the identification and division of the other matrimonial assets _was a live issue to be determined at the ancillary hearing_.

32     In response, the defendant’s counsel, Mr Liew, made the following arguments: [^12]

> (a)     First, and while Mr Liew conceded (rightly, in my view) that section 112(2) WC legislatively empowers this court to assess parties’ asset position _in its entirety_, and this is not fettered by parties’ pleadings, the plaintiff should nevertheless be held to her express prayers as stated in SOCA1. This was especially so given that the plaintiff had the benefit of legal representation. In this connection, Mr Liew also objected against the plaintiff’s attempt to ‘amend’ her prayers in SOCA1 _via_ her P1AOM.

> (b)     Second, Mr Liew argues that because of the state of the plaintiff’s pleadings, the defendant was denied a reasonable opportunity to present his case in terms of the division of the other assets. Mr Liew argued that had SOCA1 been properly amended, the defendant’s affidavit and submissions could and would have taken a significantly different course. When I queried Mr Liew about the discovery orders made in April 2019, Mr Liew’s response was that it was more a unilateral direction by the Court to provide discovery, as opposed to one which concurrently determined that the issue of the division of the other matrimonial assets was ‘live’.

> (c)     Third and related to the second point, Mr Liew contended that by allowing the ancillary hearing to proceed on the assessment and division of the other matrimonial assets, the defendant would be prejudiced. Mr Liew’s argument on prejudice took on two facets:

>> (i)       First, the defendant would be prejudiced in that he had not fully canvassed his arguments against including each any every matrimonial asset listed by the defendant after the discovery order (despite making submissions on _some_ of the assets in this D2AOM, and was in a position to deal with the plaintiff’s case in his written submissions).

>> (ii)       Second, and perhaps the more innovative argument, was that because these ancillary matter proceedings arose out of a _judgment for judicial separation_, the defendant would be prejudiced to fully ventilate his position if there were _subsequent divorce proceedings_. Put another way, because it is conceptually possible for there to be divorce proceedings _after_ a judgment of judicial separation, there would therefore be a second occasion where the issue of ancillaries (including division) would arise. If I decided on the division of the other assets now, the defendant would apparently be prejudiced from arguing these points at the ancillary hearing for the _subsequent and prospective divorce proceedings_.

> (d)     Fourth, Mr Liew contended by the plaintiff’s own conduct, she was acting in accordance with \[7(e)\] SOCA1. In this regard, the plaintiff sought to keep certain assets which her in her own name (ie, certain bank accounts). At the same time, Mr Liew contended that the plaintiff wanted a stake in the defendant’s own assets. In short, Mr Liew contended that the plaintiff simply wished to have her cake and eat it.

33     After assessing parties’ submissions, I made the following findings and observations.

34     As acknowledged by Mr Liew, section 112 WC provides this court with very wide powers of division. It empowers this court to order the division of “any matrimonial asset”. Any limits to such power, in a manner of speaking, relates to whether such division is “just and equitable” (section 112(1) WC), and that the court is to have regard to “all circumstances of the case” (section 112(2) WC). The corollary to this is that to a certain extent, this court’s power of division is not (and should not) _prima facie_ be limited by the state of parties’ pleadings.

35     But that is not to say that parties’ pleadings (and prayers for reliefs sought) can be pushed aside as and when it was convenient. The fundamentals of procedural fairness require that a party is entitled to know the case he or she must meet, and that can only be established by reference to what parties have stated in their pleadings. As it is often said and argued - one lives and dies by their pleadings.

36     While this adage is acutely engrained in the minds of the quintessential ‘adversarial’ civil litigator, it may not necessarily be completely imported into the family context. There are authorities which highlight the different (or seemingly less stringent) approach taken in family proceedings vis-à-vis civil proceedings. For instance, in _TIG v TIH_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 1 SLR 1218</span> (“_TIG”_), Judicial Commissioner (“JC”) Thean (as she then was) noted (at \[22\]):

> One fundamental difference between family ancillary matters and other kinds of civil proceedings is the lack of pleadings in family ancillary matters…In family ancillary matters what guides the court’s inquiry are the factors enumerated in ss 112(2) and 114(1) of the \[WC\] which pertain to the division of the matrimonial assets and the award of post-divorce maintenance for the former wife respectively. These factors are numerous and, even then, they are explicitly provided to be non-exhaustive. _Nevertheless_, this ought _not_ to be a licence for parties to file multiple rounds of affidavits or to bring in through cross-examination a wide-range of accusations that, on a holistic view of the case, ultimately have only marginal relevance to the issues at hand.

37     Thean JC went on further to state (at \[28\]):

> In pursuing the object of achieving a “just, expeditious and economical disposal” of the ancillaries, much would depend on the facts of each case and the matters on which the evidence is sought…It is best for parties to set out issues in advance and seek to prepare their cases accordingly, rather than to wait until a late stage of proceedings.

38     In _UDA v UDB_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1433</span> (“_UDA_”) (at \[39\]), Justice (“J”) Ong highlighted how a civil trial is markedly different from an ancillary matter proceeding where in those proceedings “parties set out their cases in their pleadings and are bound by them”.

39     In _BOR v BOS and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGCA 78</span> (“_BOR_”), the Court of Appeal highlighted (at \[3\]) how (in the context of “complicated matrimonial litigation”) parties’ positions can evolve over the course of the ancillary hearing.

40     The decisions I highlighted above acknowledge and underscore that the ‘quasi-inquisitorial’ role of a court in ancillary proceedings is slightly incongruous with the adversarial model of orthodox civil litigation - it accords this court much greater powers to investigate ancillary issues to ensure, as required under section 112(1) WC, a “just and equitable” division of the matrimonial assets. This objective has less to do with procedural limitations (to a certain extent), and more to ensure, in my view, that what parties have justifiably built during the course of their marriage is appropriately apportioned as a result of the breakdown of their relationship. Such an objective differs from issues of strict rights and obligations in civil litigation, where in those cases the demands for clarity and specificity are more rigorous.

41     That said, if that were the position, then what is the point of being so prescriptive in the form of the reliefs sought? What is the point of Form 6 in making a clear distinction between division of the matrimonial home and _other_ matrimonial assets, only for parties to be able to make, in my view, a significant departure later on in the proceedings? Shouldn’t parties (especially those represented) be bound by their decisions on what they wanted (or did not want) at the outset? Even if parties were to make such a departure, should this court be more circumspect of such attempts? I would pause here and note that neither _TIG_, _UDA_, or _BOR_ appear to deal with present situation where a party seeks to depart from what was originally ‘pleaded’ in their statement claim.

42     In the present case, I was prepared to allow the plaintiff to ‘depart’ from SOCA1 for the following reasons:

> (a)     At the outset, I rejected Ms Huang’s attempt to rationalise the reading of the plaintiff’s prayers in SOCA1. I found it somewhat implausible to accept Ms Huang’s argument that the intent for a division of the other assets was predicated on there being insufficient payment of the plaintiff’s share of the matrimonial home. If anything, this runs counter to how the plaintiff’s affidavit of assets and means were presented.

> (b)     In this connection, I also found Ms Huang’s explanation at the hearing that \[7(e)\] SOCA1 was drafted in that manner because the plaintiff was not fully aware as to the real extent of the defendant’s assets somewhat odd. If the plaintiff was truly not aware of the state of the other matrimonial assets, would it not have been instinctive to preserve her position and provide the general prayer for a division of such assets? The fact that the plaintiff deliberately chose, _in the face of uncertainty and with the benefit of legal advice_, for parties to keep their own assets in their own names, must be strongly indicative of a specific course of action the plaintiff wished to take. I pause here and not that whilst not determinative of the issue, I note that the defendant’s disclosure disclosed in excess of $1 million in assets. Would the plaintiff’s position be different if what was disclosed was a lower figure? Giving the plaintiff the greatest benefit of doubt, she chose to ‘revise’ her case at the 1st Affidavit of Assets and Means, _before_ seeing what the defendant initially disclosed.

> (c)     In any case, as I highlighted earlier, Mr Liew accepted that in assessing what is just and equitable division, this court has the power and jurisdiction to determine parties’ _complete matrimonial asset pool_. In that regard, the court’s ‘quasi-inquisitorial’ powers would not be limited by parties ‘pleadings’. As I highlighted earlier, such an approach accords with the justice of the case to ensure that there is a proper apportionment of what parties have built up as a unit upon termination of that relationship.

> (d)     While the court has such powers, I would pause here and clarify to state this not be treated as a _general rule_. It cannot be the case where parties can, at their whim and fancy, alter and depart from their original cases (except with proper leave), lest they be seen as seeking to seek a windfall or extricate themselves from a seemingly ‘bad’ decision. In this case, I was _only just_ satisfied that the conduct of the proceedings allowed for the defendant to have had the opportunity to meet this ‘revised’ case.

> (e)     In the present case, I highlight how parties were directed to (and the defendant participated in) seek further discovery from each other. As I highlighted earlier (see \[31(d)\] above), in his request for discovery dated 1 March 2019, the defendant sought discovery of the plaintiff’s club membership for the purposes of “division of assets”.[^13] Further, parties went through a fairly lengthy and contested case conference on 17 April 2019 where specific orders of discovery were made against the defendant for disclosure of his other assets. In this regard, Mr Liew sought to impress on me that as this case was a ‘hotwash’ matter, the orders of discovery given, in a manner of speaking, was as a matter of course. However, I was not inclined to accept this argument because if the position were truly that the issue of the division of other assets were completely irrelevant, such arguments would have been canvassed at the material time. Furthermore, the question of whether the plaintiff ought to be strictly bound by her prayers could have been determined as a preliminary issue _even before_ the case conference in April 2019. In short, there was nothing to suggest that the defendant was completely taken by surprise by this revision, and was in no position to avail himself of the necessary recourse at the appropriate time. Quite the contrary, the defendant’s conduct suggested that the issue of the division of the other matrimonial assets had, at least by March 2019, been a ‘live’ matter which the defendant himself participated in.

> (f)     In addition to being aware of this ‘revised’ case, the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to address this case. At the hearing, Mr Liew accepted that against the discovery orders made at April case conference, there was nothing preventing Mr Liew from making his own specific discovery application on the plaintiff’s other assets. As such, it cannot be denied that that opportunity was open to the defendant. Further, even after the discovery orders were made (and after the defendant filed his disclosure affidavit), the defendant had (and exercised) the opportunity to put his position on why some of these additional assets ought not to be included into pool of matrimonial assets. In his 2nd Affidavit of Assets and Means[^14], the defendant adduced evidence on why certain investments ought not to be included into the pool of matrimonial assets.[^15]

> (g)     I finally turn to Mr Liew’s arguments on prejudice. To recap, Mr Liew’s first argument on prejudice was that the defendant was prevented from fully canvassing his arguments against including each any every matrimonial asset into the pool of division. I was not inclined to accept this argument because, as I highlighted above, by the time the defendant was aware of this ‘revised’ case, the defendant had every opportunity to ensure that he could fully meet this ‘revised’ case. It did not lie in the defendant’s mouth to allege prejudice when he had, at all material times, the ability to full address this case. As I highlighted above, the defendant submitted against the inclusion of _some_ of the matrimonial assets. The fact that the defendant _chose_ not to deal with the assets in its _entirety_ could not be a basis to assert prejudice.

> (h)     Mr Liew’s second argument on prejudice was predicated on his argument that these ancillary matters arose out of a judgment of judicial separation (and not a divorce). In unpacking his argument, Mr Liew is suggesting that because there is a _legal possibility_ of divorce proceedings being commenced _post_ a judgment of judicial separation, there may be a possibility that parties may find themselves in another set of ancillary proceedings. On that basis, Mr Liew contended that by dealing with the division of the other matrimonial assets at this stage, the defendant would be deprived of his opportunity to fully submit on such matter at the ancillary hearing for the _plausible future divorce proceedings_.

> (i)     At the outset, section 112(1) WC is clear that a division can take place “subsequent to the grant of a judgment of … judicial separation”. Indeed, Mr Liew was not challenging this court’s _power_ to make a division following a judgment of judicial separation. To my mind, for Mr Liew’s argument to take him any further, it was incumbent on him to establish that ancillary proceedings which flowed from divorce proceedings commenced _after_ judicial separation proceedings was, in the present case, more than just a _legal possibility_, but rather, a _factual and real possibility_. As highlighted in _USC_, the reason why the plaintiff commenced a writ of judicial separation (as opposed to a writ of divorce) was for religious reasons. As I also explained in _USC_, for all intents and purposes, _as between the parties_, the judgment of judicial separation was no different than a judgment of divorce. So while I was prepared to accept Mr Liew’s argument _as a matter of concept_, such an outcome fell shy of being a reasonably foreseeable reality.

> (j)     Even if I was prepared to accept Mr Liew’s technical argument, what would be the basis in deferring the issue of division which was already front and centre before this court? On Mr Liew’s own admission as to the wide powers of this court to order a division, what was the real legal and logical basis to deferring this matter to a _possible_ divorce proceeding in the _undetermined future_? Not only would parties be left hanging with no complete resolution in sight, it will be contingent on _someone commencing divorce proceedings_. Would it be in parties’ best interest to delay this matter when it could be resolved at this juncture? After assessing parties’ argument, I found Mr Liew’s contentions of prejudice to be more apparent than real.

43     For those reason, I was prepared to assess parties’ pool of matrimonial assets _in its entirety_.

#### Identification of Matrimonial Assets

44     For ease of reference, I have adopted the references used by the plaintiff in her written submissions[^16] in dealing with whether certain assets which could be considered a matrimonial asset (and if so, the value to be according to such asset).

##### (1)   Matrimonial Home[^17]

45     In both parties’ documents, parties were _ad idem_ insofar as the matrimonial home formed part of the pool of matrimonial assets. There also does not appear to be a dispute that the estimate sale price of the matrimonial home was $430,000.

46     Parties also did not dispute that there were no existing liabilities on the matrimonial home.

##### (2)   Standard Chartered Joint Account Nos. xxx-2 & xxx-8[^18]

47     Following from my finding to asset the matrimonial assets in its entirety, and on the documents before me, there would also be no dispute that the Standard Chartered Accounts held jointly by parties also formed part of the pool of matrimonial assets.

##### (3)   Plaintiff’s[^19] and Defendant’s[^20] Personal Bank Accounts

48     There can be no dispute that these accounts ought forms part of the matrimonial assets.

##### (4)   Bank Accounts Held Jointly by the Parties with the Children

49     The accounts relating to the children can be broken down into three distinct groups:

> (a)     First, the Standard Chartered accounts held by the plaintiff;[^21]

> (b)     The POSB Trust accounts held by the plaintiff;[^22] and

> (c)     The Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (“OCBC”) accounts held by the defendant.[^23]

50     With regard to the Standard Chartered accounts, the plaintiff herself had taken the position that these accounts be included into the matrimonial pool of assets. I saw no reason to depart from the plaintiff’s decision to do so.

51     As regards the POSB accounts, the plaintiff sought to make the distinction between these accounts and the Standard Chartered accounts. From the plaintiff’s evidence, the critical point of distinction appeared to be that the POSB accounts comprise exclusively of the children’s _ang pow_ packets from Chinese New Year. This contention appears to be consistent with the defendant’s narration, where he states that the POSB accounts comprised of “whatever monies the children got, be it from birthdays or Chinese New Year ang pows or rewards or prizes.”[^24]

52     However, where parties differ (at least from the face of the documents) is that on the defendant’s account, the children’s monies were distributed within _both_ the Standard Chartered and POSB accounts. On the plaintiff’s account, it would solely be into the POSB account.

53     However, a review of the plaintiff’s documents makes no discernible distinction in the transactions in either sets of accounts, much less the plaintiff’s decision to include the Standard Chartered accounts, but exclude the POSB accounts. Moreover, on the plaintiff’s account that her “parents would give each child a $500 ang pow for their birthday and a $200 ang pow for Chinese New Year”[^25], it is somewhat peculiar, considering the children’s ages, why the current balance in those accounts is a little over $1,000. No explanation was provided in the plaintiff’s evidence.

54     In the premises, I saw no real distinction between the Standard Chartered Accounts and the POSB accounts, and included them into the pool of assets.

55     The last category of accounts deals with the OCBC accounts held by the defendant. At the outset, I note that these accounts were not initially included in the list of bank accounts in the defendant’s 1st Affidavit of Assets and Means. It was only in his voluntary affidavit post-discovery orders did the defendant include information about these accounts.

56     Even then, the defendant only disclosed statements relating to one of the accounts. Simply put, the defendant only made partial disclosure.

57     As regards these accounts, the defendant contended that these accounts were held jointly with his daughter. However, a review of the actual bank statements provides no discernible information on the nature of the account, and whether it was, truly intended for the children. Apart from transactions of $50 which the defendant himself deposits, the only other significant transaction was a cash and cheque deposit in March 2018.

58     As regards the $50 dollar deposits made to these accounts, on the _defendant’s own documents_, the defendant himself labels the purportedly joint accounts as being his “own account”[^26]. While not conclusive in itself, this was indicative of the defendant’s _subjective intention_ of what the account was intended to be, or at the very least, what the accounts were not intended to be.

59     I found it incredible for the defendant to assert that the OCBC accounts objectively referred to the children’s account when the defendant himself addresses it as his own account. In the premises, I was inclined to also include the OCBC accounts into the matrimonial pool of assets.

##### (5)   Plaintiff’s POSB Account with Her Mother[^27]

60     The next set of bank accounts deal with two POSB accounts which the plaintiff says she held jointly with her mother. The plaintiff submitted that these accounts ought not to be included into the pool of matrimonial assets principally on the argument that the amounts currently in those accounts “are small and the monies … were contributed by the \[plaintiff’s\] mother”.[^28]

61     Insofar as the amounts in those accounts were small, it appeared to be principally premised on the plaintiff’s admission that she had drawn down from the accounts to support her and \[T\]’s living expenses pending the disposal of the present disputes. Insofar as the plaintiff submitted that the amounts in the account were contributed by her mother, the plaintiff also submitted that she herself had contributed into that account during the subsistence of the marriage.

62     While the plaintiff made the aforementioned submissions, no attempt was made to account for the potential contributions made by both the plaintiff and her mother. Further, while some transactions were recorded, there was no meaningful insight on the true character of the account, and whether it corroborates with what the plaintiff actually contended. Interestingly, for the lack of clarity the plaintiff argues against the defendant’s OCBC accounts purportedly held for the children, what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, and those arguments apply equally to these accounts held by the plaintiff.

63     In the premises, I was inclined to include this account into the pool of matrimonial assets (at least to the extent I recognised that the plaintiff herself has conceded that she has drawn down from the account during the subsistence of the marriage).

##### (6)   Plaintiff’s Insurance Policies[^29]

64     I now deal with the insurance policies.

65     In her documents, the plaintiff listed a fairly extensive list of insurance policies she had purchased to be included into the pool of assets. The defendant’s principal position was not so much to dispute their inclusion, but to highlight that he had been responsible for paying for the premiums of such policies.

66     In this regard, the defendant further highlighted that 8 American Insurance Association (“AIA”) policies were purchased in August 2018, shortly before the judgement of judicial separation was made. In making this point, the defendant’s objections related more to whether he should be made liable for maintaining those policies, as opposed to whether they be included into the pool of assets.

67     On that premise, I was more inclined to take the defendant’s contention more towards the plaintiff’s financial capability, as opposed to whether those assets be subject to division. For those reasons, I was prepared to include these policies into the pool of assets.

##### (7)   Defendant’s Insurance Policies[^30]

68     With regard to the defendant’s insurance policies, these policies were disclosed _after_ the discovery orders were made. In resisting the inclusion of these policies, the defendant’s principle contention was that these policies were purchased _before_ the marriage, and should therefore fall outside the pool of matrimonial assets. As highlighted in tabular form below, the 4 policies were purchased in March 1990, March 1992, March 1993, and March 1997.

69     As highlighted most recently by the Court of Appeal in _USA v USB_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 75</span> (“_USA_”) (at \[19(c)\]) such ‘pre-marriage’ assets can be considered to be part of the pool of the matrimonial assets to the extent that “the proportion of the value of the asset that was acquired during the marriage should go into the pool”. This accords with the principle highlighted in _USA_ (at \[28\]) that:

> An increase in value of an asset made by the owning spouse during the marriage would represent the material gains of the marital partnership.

70     In furtherance of the aforementioned principle and on the basis that the parties were married in September 2017, the proportion of the value of the policies which accrued _before and during the marriage_ can be summarised as follows:

71     I would pause here and highlight that from the above extract, the _main_ increase and proportion of the values of these policies arose _during_ the marriage. I also note from the documents that the defendant paid for 21 years’ worth of premiums amounting to approximately $120,000. [^31]

72     In determining the value of each policy, I made certain adjustments and apportionments of each policy based on when it was purchased and its surrender value _at the date of the judgment of judicial separation_. In this regard, I was of the view that it would be inequitable, and accordingly disagreed with the plaintiff, to value the AIA and Great Eastern policies as at the surrender value _on a maturity date of 2038_ (ie, 18 years from now). To take such a value would speculative and not principled.

73     Unfortunately, neither party sought to adjust the values of the policies on the assumption that the policies were to be surrendered at the date of the judgment of judicial separation (or the hearing of the ancillary matters). Essentially it was left to the court to make broad adjustments to the values of these policies.

##### (8)   Defendant’s Land Banking Investments[^32]

74     The next set of assets relate to certain land banking investments amounting to $90,000 made by the defendant _during_ the subsistence of the marriage. For completeness, these investments were purchased in May 2015 and March 2016, well within the time when there were clear fractures in parties’ relationship.

75     On the incomplete set of documents disclosed by the documents,[^33] the defendant was expected to receive approximately 64% return of the investments over a 36-month period on one investment, and approximately 24% returns over a 24-month period for another investment.

76     Purely on the basis of when these investments were acquired, Mr Liew conceded that these investments would ordinarily be considered a matrimonial asset. That said, the defendant contended that the value of these investments should not be included, or written-off, on the basis that the defendant has apparent difficulties in receiving his investment pay-outs. While the documents submitted do suggest that the defendant has received some pay-outs,[^34] and giving the defendant the benefit of doubt given the incomplete nature of his disclosure, the defendant has not recouped his investment, let alone realised the investment potential represented to him. On that basis, the entire value of the sums invested ought to be removed from the pool of matrimonial assets.

77     In short, the defendant wished to be absolved of a seemingly bad investment made with monies acquired _during_ the subsistence of the marriage.

78     In terms of lost investments, the plaintiff made reference to the High Court decision of _AJR v AJS_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 4 SLR 617</span>, where the court held (at \[10\]) that:

> If there are any matrimonial assets (including cash) proved to have been expended by either party for his or her own investment purposes _before_ the date of the Interim Judgment and both parties did not intend for the other party to partake in the investment, then the total amount expended…would also be notionally added to the total net value of matrimonial assets available for distribution.

79     The above extract makes reference to two touchstones in determining whether investments are to be included into the pool of matrimonial assets – first, that the investment was for personal purposes and purchased before the judgement of divorce (or in this case, judgment of judicial separation), and second, _both_ parties did not intend for the investor to partake in that investment. As regards the first touchstone, there was, as highlighted earlier, no dispute that the investments were purchased during the subsistence of the marriage. Insofar as to whether it was intended to be for personal purposes, I was satisfied that that was so. If not, the defendant would have been able to assert that the plaintiff was aware of, and correspondingly agreed to that investment. As I highlighted earlier, contemporaneous with the time when the investments were purchased, parties’ relationship was clearly fractured.

80     It follows from that observation that the second touchstone would be satisfied because there was nothing in the evidence to suggest any consensus as regards that investment. Indeed, the only point that the defendant made was that the investment did not, unfortunately, reap the benefits _he_ expected. In essence, there was nothing to suggest that (by conduct or otherwise) that the defendant’s investments be ringfenced such that he solely bear the burden (and correspondingly enjoyed the gains) of the same.

81     After considering parties’ submissions, I was prepared to notionally include only the _principal_ value of the investments. Giving the defendant the benefit of doubt, there was insufficient material before me (partly due to the defendant’s own incomplete disclosure) to include both the value of the principal _and_ the projected returns of the said investments.

##### (9)   Plaintiff’s Shares and Securities[^35]

82     Given the time in which these assets were acquired, there was no reason not to include the same as part of the pool of matrimonial assets.

83     I pause here and note that in her 1st Affidavit of Assets and Means, the plaintiff admitted to liquidating (1) 3,000 ComfortDelGro Ordinary Shares, and (2) 4,000 Singapore Press Holdings (“SPH”) Ordinary Shares. While the plaintiff acknowledged the liquidation, no evidence was submitted on the value of the liquidation.

##### (10)   Defendant’s Shares and Securities[^36]

84     As regards the defendant’s shares, I note that out of all the shares listed by the defendant in his documents, the following shares were said to be purchased _before_ the marriage:

> (a)     1867 shares in ComfortDelGro;

> (b)     100 shares in Investment Capital Partners (“ICP”) Ltd;

> (c)     55 shares in Thakral; and

> (d)     1610 shares in Singapore Telecommunications (“Singtel”).[^37]

85     Save for the bare annotation in his 1st Affidavit of Assets and Means, the defendant did not have documentary evidence showing that the aforementioned shares _were in fact_ purchased before the marriage. To that extent that the defendant was not able to establish, _on a prima facie basis_, that these were pre-marital assets, the burden still remained on him to establish the same. Therefore, I was inclined to include _all_ of the shares listed by the defendant as being part of the pool of matrimonial assets.

##### (11)   Plaintiff’s Country Club Membership[^38]

86     On the plaintiff’s own concession, I saw no reason not to include this into the pool of matrimonial assets.

##### (12)   Defendant’s motor vehicle[^39]

87     I saw no reason not to include the family motor vehicle into the pool of matrimonial assets. As regards its value, I note in the defendant’s own documents the net value of the vehicle.[^40]

##### (13)   Parties’ CPF Monies[^41]

88     There was no dispute between parties that these accounts, on principle, constituted a matrimonial asset.

##### (14)   The Defendant’s Alleged Acts of Dissipation

89     The final set of ‘matrimonial’ assets which the plaintiff sought to include into the pool related to certain sums of money which the defendant was said to have dissipated, as well as the unaccounted liquidation of certain shares. The five ‘assets’ highlighted by the plaintiff were as follows:

> (a)     A withdrawal of $90,000 from parties’ joint Standard Chartered Account Number xxx-2 (the “1st $90,000 withdrawal”);

> (b)     A withdrawal of $90,000 from parties’ joint Standard Chartered Account Number xxx-8 (the “2nd $90,000 withdrawal”);

> (c)     Withdrawals amounting to $37,740 from the defendant’s Standard Chartered Account Number xxx-4 (the “$37,740 withdrawal”);

> (d)     Liquidation of 3,000 Wheelock Property shares amounting to $6,300; and

> (e)     Liquidation of 70 JD Com shares amounting to $4,125.74.

90     I deal with each asset in turn.

91     With regard to the 1st $90,000 withdrawal, there is no dispute that these sums were transferred from parties’ joint account to one of the defendant’s personal accounts. Further, in none of the documents does the defendant explain the basis for the withdrawal, and whether ‘restitution’ of the same has been made into parties’ joint account, or whether those sums were used for the acquisition of other assets (and if so, whether such assets were intended to be ringfenced). I was therefore inclined to include the 1st $90,000 withdrawal back into the matrimonial pool of assets.

92     As regards the 2nd $90,000 withdrawal:

> (a)     The plaintiff’s case was that the defendant withdrew from parties’ Standard Chartered Account Number xxx-8 on 9 May 2015, and transferred it into his Standard Chartered Account Number xxx-6 on the same day.

> (b)     The plaintiff relies on the bank statements annexed in her 2nd Affidavit of Asset and Means[^42]. More pertinently, on the plaintiff’s case, this was a separate and distinct withdrawal from the 1st $90,000 withdrawal.

> (c)     However, a review of the plaintiff’s documents shows the following:

>> (i)       On 9 May 2015, the documents show that $90,000 was transferred from Standard Chartered Account Number xxx-2 to Standard Chartered Account Number xxx-4 (ie, the 1st $90,000 withdrawal).[^43]

>> (ii)       This transfer was recorded in Standard Chartered Account Number xxx-4.[^44]

>> (iii)       On the same day, $90,000 was transferred from Standard Chartered Account Number xxx-4 (ie, the account which received the 1st $90,000 withdrawal, and _not_ xxx-8 as highlighted by the plaintiff) to Standard Chartered Account Number xxx-6.

>> (iv)       Accordingly, there was _no transaction_ on 9 May 2015 as _between Standard Chartered Account Number xxx-8 and Standard Chartered Account Number xxx-6_. This is evident from the plaintiff’s _own_ documents.[^45]

93     On that basis, I was only inclined to include the 1st $90,000 withdrawal into the pool of matrimonial assets. As I had highlighted above, there was only one withdrawal from parties joint account (Standard Chartered Account Number xxx-2) - firstly into the defendant’s Standard Chartered Account Number xxx-4, and subsequently into the defendant’s Standard Chartered Account Number xxx-6.

94     In other words, the defendant made 1 withdrawal from parties’ joint account, and shifted the same monies into two of his personal accounts. It was _not_ a situation where the defendant made two different withdrawals of $90,000 from two different accounts.

95     I turn next to the $37,740 withdrawal. This aggregate sum comprises of 10 cheque withdrawals in October 2018 amounting to the stated sum. Save for two cheques which the defendant provides no substantiation for (ie, SCB Cheque Number xxx26 dated 2 October 2018 for $400, and SCB Cheque Number xxx34 dated 11 October 2018 for $5,400, being a total sum of $5,800), the defendant justifies the other withdrawals as being payments for Mr Liew’s legal fees amounting to $31,940.

96     Whilst that sum is not inconceivable, what I found most peculiar is that the defendant had chosen not to disclose any of Mr Liew’s invoices. What was also peculiar was that virtually all the cheques were written on the either 10 October 2018 or 11 October 2018 (a total of 7 cheques). If indeed these cheques were meant to pay for Mr Liew’s invoices, even on an aggregate basis, I found it most odd why multiple cheques would have to be written. On that basis, I was inclined to include the $37,740 withdrawal into the pool of assets.

97     Lastly, I will deal with the liquidation of the Wheelock Property Shares and JD Com shares collectively:

> (a)     The aggregate value of the shares that was liquidated was $10,425.74 ($6,300 + $4,125.74).

> (b)     At the outset, I found it inconsistent for the plaintiff to contend that the defendant account for the shares which he had liquidated, but does not require the same treatment for the shares she _herself_ had liquidated (ie, 3,000 ComfortDelGro Ordinary Shares and 4,000 SPH Ordinary Shares).

> (c)     To that end, the only point of distinction which would assist the plaintiff, on the authority of _AJR v AJS_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 4 SLR 617</span>, would be that the sale of the Wheelock Property and JD Com shares was done “unfairly” or “unjustly” so as not to be considered acceptable by this court.

> (d)     However, unlike the withdrawals I dealt with earlier, there was nothing to suggest that these sales were sufficiently suspicious so as to warrant replacing the value of these liquidated shares back into the pool of matrimonial assets. On balance, and whilst I note that the defendant was less than candid with these liquidations, I was not prepared to find that the sale of these shares, in and of themselves, constituted unlawful dissipation.

#### Total Valuation of Matrimonial Assets

98     With regard to the assets I considered to form part of the pool of matrimonial assets, I saw no reason to depart from the valuations provided by parties in their documents. To the extent that the valuation of the assets was not on the precise date when the judgment of judicial separation was granted, I found the deviations to a greater or lesser extent within reasonable norms.

99     On that basis, the total value of the identified matrimonial assets were as follows:

#### Division – Initial Apportionment

100    Following from the identification and valuation of the matrimonial assets, the next issue to be determined was the manner and proportion of division.

101    At the outset, both parties appear to have adopted the structured approach in _ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span> (“_ANJ_”) (the _ANJ Approach_) in calculating the proportion of division. That said, I note that reference was made by the plaintiff of the approach adopted in _TNL v TNK_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 1 SLR 609</span> (“_TNL_”), which supports the proportion for an inclination towards equal division for ‘long single income marriages’. The approach in _TNL_ approach was also confirmed in _USA_. A useful summary of the two approaches was provided in _USA_ is reproduced here:

> We recently affirmed the structured approach set out in _ANJ v ANK_ in _UYQ v UYP_. Briefly stated, the structured approach \[i.e., the _ANJ Approach_\] prescribes the following steps: (a) first, ascribe a ratio that represents each party’s direct contributions relative to those of the other party, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party has made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets; (b) second, ascribe a second ratio to represent each party’s indirect contribution to the well-being of the family relative to that of the other throughout the marriage; and (c) third, using each party’s respective direct and indirect percentage contributions, derive each party’s average percentage contribution to the family that would form the basis to divide the matrimonial assets (_ANJ v ANK_ at \[22\]; see also _BPC v BPB_ at \[70\]). _In TNL v TNK and another appeal and another matter <span class="citation">\[2017\] 1 SLR 609</span> (“TNL v TNK”), we held that the structured approach \[i.e., the ANJ Approach\] does not apply to long Single-Income marriages_.

> (emphasis added)

102    The approach in _TNL_ was not relied on by the defendant in his submissions. That said, there was nothing in the defendant’s submissions to suggest why the approach in _TNL should not_ be applied.

103    In her submissions, it was the plaintiff’s position that there was no _practical_ distinction between the _ANJ Approach_ and the approach in _TNL_. Both, on the plaintiff’s assessment, would produce similar results. That said, I note that the similarities in the results would only be predicate on my accepted on _how_ the plaintiff applied the _ANJ Approach_. For completeness, the way in which the defendant applied the _ANJ Approach_ had the diametrically opposite result from the plaintiff.

104    In the present case, this was a 21-year marriage (ie, from the date of marriage to the date of judgment of judicial separation). As raised in _USC_ and in these proceedings, Mr Liew spared no effort to reiterate how the plaintiff had, by her various acts of leaving the home, effectively created a situation where the _effective_ length of marriage was lower. To recap, Mr Liew contended that at the very least, the marriage ‘ended’ in 2016 when the plaintiff moved out of the matrimonial home for the last time.

105    While there was some force to Mr Liew’s contention, I did not agree that the intermediate cracks (and patch-up works), regardless of whose fault it was, changed the fact that the marriage was subsisting for that period of time. To a lesser or greater extent, contentious issues and even moments of disengagement between spouses in a marriage is, to a lesser or greater extent, par for the course. Marriage is an essentially a relationship founded on the multitude of realities which comes with human relations.

106    In any case, even if I were to accept Mr Liew’s argument (ie, that the marriage ended when the plaintiff left the matrimonial home in 2016), on my calculations, it was still a marriage _in excess of 15 years_ (ie, approximately 18 years).

107    On either parties’ cases, I found little contention to the characterisation that for all intents and purposes, this was a long marriage.

108    The next touchstone in _TNL_ was to consider whether this was a ‘single-income’ marriage. On parties’ undisputed evidence, the plaintiff stopped working from 2003 when \[E\] was born. This was approximately 6 years into the marriage. This was not an insignificant amount of time.

109    However, I was of the view that the plaintiff spent _more than twice_ the amount of time in the marriage where the defendant was the sole breadwinner of the family as opposed to a dual-income family. More importantly, I also took the view that it would be in the latter years of the defendant’s career where he would have reaped the rewards of his experience and seniority. Put another way, the _quantity and value_ of the assets which the defendant was able to accumulate was, in my view, less likely to have been taken place in the first 6 years whilst the plaintiff was working. On that premise, there was nothing before me to contradict the conclusion that on the whole, one spouse (the defendant) was the sole income earner , with the other spouse (the plaintiff) playing the dedicated role of the homemaker.

110    On that basis, and after considering the situation as a whole, I was of the view that the approach in _TNL_ was suitable in the present circumstances.

111    On the basis that I was satisfied that this was a long single-income marriage, the next question is where in the spectrum of ‘equal’ distribution does this marriage lie. I pause here and note the observations made by the Court of Appeal in _BOR_ in reviewing the trends of previous decisions on apportioning division for long marriages (_BOR_ at \[111\] to \[114\]). In _BOR_ the Court of Appeal noted that a ‘moderately long marriage’ was around 15 to 18 years, and in those cases, the homemaker was awarded between 35% to 40% of the matrimonial assets.[^80]

112    As I highlighted earlier, in the present case, the marriage would be _at least_ 18 years long. This is on the basis that I were to have accept Mr Liew’s arguments to the fullest effects. Given that I was not inclined to do so, and consistent with the previous precedents highlighted in _BOR_, I was, as a starting point, inclined to award the plaintiff 45% of the matrimonial assets.

113    For completeness, even if I were wrong in applying the _TNL_ Approach, I was of the view the applying the _ANJ_ Approach would give rise to a comparative figure after making certain adjustments to the plaintiff’s contended indirect contributions. On this issue, I rejected the defendant’s assertion that he be accorded with 100% of the indirect contributions[^81]. To my mind, and despite the issues he had with the plaintiff at the later end of the marriage, there was simply no basis for the defendant to assert the implication of his submission - that the plaintiff did _completely nothing_ towards the upkeep of the household. Consistent with some of the observations I made in _USC_, I found the defendant’s assertion that he be awarded 100% of indirect contributions to be yet another glimpse of how he viewed his relationship with the plaintiff, and a more regrettably, a lack of insight on his behaviour and perspective throughout the entire course of the dispute.

#### Division – Adjustments

114    After determining the starting proportion of division, the next issue to be determined was whether certain adjustment ought to be made. In this case, the plaintiff contended that she be awarded an uplift on the basis that an adverse inference be drawn against the defendant. This was broadly premised on his incomplete and improper disclosure of his full list of assets, and his acts of dissipation.

115    The court’s power to award an uplift to one party on account of an adverse inference being drawn against the other party is evident in numerous cases (see _Au Kin Chung v Ho Kit Joo_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] SGHC 150</span> (at \[34\] to \[36\]; _Chan Pui Yin v Lim Tiong Kei_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 4 SLR 875</span> (at \[52\]); _TYS v TYT_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 244</span> (at \[45\] to \[48\])). For completeness, whilst I note that the cases I was referred to either pre-date the _ANJ_ approach, or were made in the context in the application of the structured approach in _ANJ_. The cases did not deal with a situation where the issues of uplifts (or reductions) were applied _after_ applying the approach in _TNL_. Be that as it may, I was of the view that there was nothing in principle why, if an adverse inference were to be found, that it only be limited to one approach of division and not the other. As the Court of Appeal highlighted in _ANJ_ (at \[29\] and \[30\]):

> 29    Finally, for the avoidance of doubt, we should add that nothing we have said thus far detracts from the court’s powers to draw adverse inferences against either party whenever he or she is found to have failed to make full and frank disclosure of the matrimonial assets. It is trite that the party whom the court has found to have hidden away certain matrimonial assets would receive a lower proportion of the known assets (if the court has not already added a specific sum into the pool of matrimonial assets available for distribution to account for the undisclosed assets)…

> 30    … The controlling principle has always been and remains that the court must approach the exercise \[of division\] with broad strokes based on its feel of what is just and equitable on the facts of the case…

116    Against that backdrop, the plaintiff’s contentions in support of drawing an adverse inference against the defendant can be further elaborated on the following bases:

> (a)     The high probability of other undisclosed assets. In the context of insurance policies, this is on account of the discrepancies in his declared expenses for insurance premiums, and the aggregate premiums for policies which are currently disclosed.[^82] The plaintiff also highlighted how there was also a reasonable possibility of there being undisclosed assets in terms of his holding in shares.[^83]

> (b)     The defendant’s incomplete disclosure of the bank accounts held in his name (solely or jointly) which were ordered to be disclosed, as well as failing to provide any statements for other bank accounts which he held.[^84]

> (c)     The defendant’s acts of dissipation (specifically the 1st 90,000 withdrawal, and the $37,740 withdrawal).

117    On the basis of the following, and given the difficulties is ascertain a specific value to the defendant’s lack of full and frank disclosure, the plaintiff submitted that there should be an 20% upward adjustment in the proportion of the matrimonial assets awarded to her.

118    If I had agreed with the plaintiff’s submissions, this would result in a final proportion of 65% in favour of the plaintiff.

119    At the ancillary hearing, Mr Liew’s framed his arguments less on justifying the defendant’s behaviour, but more on the fact that the plaintiff herself has been less than forthcoming with information regarding her finances. The defendant highlighted how the plaintiff had failed to properly account for the liquidation of her securities as well as the lack of reconciliation of the gap between the existing maintenance orders (under the Appeal Orders) and the ‘true’ expenses of \[T\] and herself. In this connection, the defendant highlighted the plaintiff’s lavish lifestyle (which was presently funded by her well-off parents), and her true intention for the defendant to fund such a lifestyle for her.

120    After assessing the evidence, and given my observations in determining the pool of matrimonial assets, it suffices to state that both parties have not been wholly cogent in setting out, with sufficiently clarity and consistency, their asset holdings. That said, the principal consideration would be the probability of such non-disclosure, and the extent of the same. On balance, I was of the view that there was a greater possibility that the defendant, being the main breadwinner at all material time, has undisclosed assets which he has chosen not to declare (or at least declare in full).

121    I was of also the view that the plaintiff was able to show a substratum of evidence to establish a case of concealment. This would be evident from, among other things, (1) the incremental nature of the defendant’s disclosure (thus necessitating an order being made against him), (2) the defendant’s lack of complete compliance with the disclosure orders (ie, the incomplete disclosure of his bank accounts, and the documents relating to his land banking investment), and (3) the accepted acts of dissipation.

122    As regards the acts of dissipation, what was most concerning was that in respect of the 1st $90,000 withdrawal, that transaction was done in an open and brazen manner. As regards the $37,740 withdrawal, there was simply no reason, on the defendant’s own explanation, why supporting documents could not have been provided to justify this expenditure. There was nothing preventing the defendant (or Mr Liew) to make the necessary redactions and disclose these invoices (and payment of the same). For the expenses where the defendant was, in a manner of speaking, called out on, he was not able to provide a satisfactory answer to such expenses. This, in my view, gives sufficient insight on the state of information which the plaintiff would not be in a position to know.

123    For completeness, I highlighted that I had some reservations in how the plaintiff herself had presented her assets (ie, the incomplete disclosure of the liquidation of her own shares). However, I was not satisfied that these non-disclosures would, by any stretch of the imagination, cancel out the defendant’s somewhat abashed non-disclosure. Accordingly, I was inclined to draw an adverse inference against the defendant.

124    The real issue therefore was how this court ought to give effect to such adverse inferences. In my judgment, and considering the value of the asset pool, I was not inclined to accept the plaintiff’s valuation of the adjustment to be awarded to her. Instead, I was of the view that a more appropriate adjustment would be to award the plaintiff with a 10% uplift of her share of the matrimonial assets. On that basis, For those reason, it is my final finding that the plaintiff be awarded 55% of the pool of matrimonial assets.

125    On that basis, the final division of the assessed matrimonial assets would be as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="24.06%"> <col width="25.98%"> <col width="49.96%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Party</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Proportion</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Value (rounded)</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Plaintiff</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">55%</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$1,074,574</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Defendant</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">45%</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$879,197</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

126    As I highlighted earlier, I invited parties to attempt to reach an agreement on the _manner of division_. However, before the deadline for parties to submit their proposals, the defendant appealed against these orders.

### Issue 2: Spousal Maintenance

127    I now turn to the issue of spousal maintenance.

128    The plaintiff’s case can be broadly summarised as follows:

> (a)     That the plaintiff’s monthly maintenance be valued at $3,500/month.

> (b)     To avoid acrimony, the payment of maintenance ought to be in a lump sum. In this connection, the multiplier to be applied ought to be _27 years_.

> (c)     The maintenance order ought to be backdated to the time of the judgment of judicial separation.

129    I deal with these issues in turn.

130    As to the monthly quantum, the plaintiff values her personal expenses to be $6,462. As against the plaintiff’s claim (ie, $3,500/month), she merely wants the defendant to contribute approximately 55% of her expenses.

131    In response, the defendant makes, among others, the following contentions:

> (a)     First, the defendant takes issue with how the plaintiff had assessed hers and the younger son’s expenses (ie, in excess of $11,000). On those figures, and in light of the earlier orders made in OSG 61, the inference to be made was that the plaintiff actually has the financial capability to meet all those expenses. Alternatively, the expenses cited by the plaintiff were inflated.

> (b)     Second, the plaintiff has “grossly under reported” her income and financial capability, at least in terms of her business venture. On the defendant’s submission, it was either a case of under reporting, or a reflection that she was not serious into making the business a viable one to support herself. On either count, the defendant invites this court to make certain inferences as to the true nature of the plaintiff’s financial capability.

> (c)     Third, when viewed realistically, her real expenses was approximately $1,400/month.

> (d)     Fourth, the plaintiff’s behaviour in the intervening period from when the proceedings commenced to the present time indicates a person who can well afford the lifestyle she has chosen on her own accord, or was living on account of the generosities of her parents, and that the defendant should be made to financially support such a lifestyle.

132    Against that backdrop, the defendant does not agree to pay any maintenance to the plaintiff.

133    Before turning to my decision, I found it apposite to make a few observations:

> (a)     I would accept the submissions made by parties that spousal maintenance at the ancillary stage is, to a certain extent, intended to give some financial stability (or preservation) to spouse post-divorce. This is especially so where the spouse was the principal homemaker of the family. To that end, the law ensures that she is taken care of as if the marriage had not broken down. On the other hand, final orders were meant to deal with slighlty more comprehensive and far-sighted objectives.

> (b)     However, such financial support is intended to complement the orders made on the division of assets. I pause here and note that on the orders of division made above, the plaintiff would stand to receive in excess of $1 million in the matrimonial assets. While that in itself should not prejudice the plaintiff from receiving maintenance, the fact that she would be receiving a not insignificant sum is a factor to be considered.

> (c)     Furthermore, I was of the view that the final orders of maintenance, while intended to place the spouse in a position where she would be able to start a new life afresh, is not intended to provide an indefinite security blanket to the plaintiff. Ultimately, it is incumbent on the plaintiff to place herself in a position where she is able to carry on this new chapter on her own accord.

> (d)     In this regard, the plaintiff is approaching 50 years. A good portion of her income-generating life was spent in the home. It cannot be denied that the income that it would be challenging for her to return to the workforce and command the types of salary she did before the birth of the elder daughter. But at the same time, I also considered it necessary to take into account that the plaintiff’s ability to independently stabilise herself financially to a reasonable level was _not_ a complete impossibility.

134    Against that backdrop, and after making adjustments on some of the plaintiff’s expenses, I was of the view that a more moderate and complementary of maintenance for the plaintiff was for $2,500 per month, that the order be backdated to the date of the judgment of judicial separation. Additionally, I was not inclined to backdate the order from the date the plaintiff left the matrimonial home in 2016, especially in light of the subsequent commencement of the present matrimonial proceedings.

135    Finally, the payment terms of the plaintiff’s maintenance shall be on the same terms as the maintenance payments for \[T\] (which I deal with below).

136    Furthermore, I was also not inclined to award the plaintiff lump sum maintenance. This was not only on the figures and multipliers submitted by the plaintiff (which I found to be wholly excessive), but also because the order of lump sum maintenance, insofar as it is intended to be a clean break, envisages parties, in my view, no longer having any more communication with each other.

137    Such a premise runs directly counter to with the fact that parties will need to undergo counselling to learn to co-parent the children. While parties may go their separate ways, they will need to learn to accept that they continue to interact with each other for their children.

### Issue 3: Maintenance for \[T\]

138    In the Appeal Orders (paragraph 14(b)), the defendant was to pay the plaintiff $1,800 as child maintenance for \[T\]. For the purposes of these ancillary proceedings, the plaintiff submitted that the defendant pays her $3,500 as maintenance for the younger son.

139    To recap, these were the same prayers sought by the plaintiff in OSG 61, which I rejected at the hearing of OSG 61, and were not appealed by the plaintiff.

140    In these ancillary proceedings, the plaintiff assessed the son’s expenses to be approximately $5,180.30. On the plaintiff’s submissions, she was prepared for the defendant to contribute 60% of those expenses (ie, the plaintiff covering 40%). Applying those proportions, 60% of the son’s expenses would be approximately $3,110, which, on the face of the plaintiff’s own documents, would be an amount _lesser_ that what she was asking for in these proceedings.

141    I would pause here and note that in OSG 61, the plaintiff had assessed \[T\]’s expenses to be $3,719.53. When compared with the present proceedings, this shows an increase of approximately $1,460 since OSG 61. In this regard, her position in the present submissions was that the maintenance orders (and perhaps by the extension, the list of expenses) in OSG 61 were ‘interim’ in the sense that in light of these proceedings, final orders would subsequently be made. To this end, the plaintiff highlighted the distinction between interim maintenance order and final maintenance orders made at the ancillary hearing.

142    As for the defendant, he submitted that the more realistic monthly expenses for the son was $990. At this juncture, it is noted that whilst the defendant appealed against the maintenance orders made in OSG 61, the Appeal Orders essentially upheld the maintenance sums previously ordered (ie, $1,800). The necessary inference was that the appellate court was satisfied that the defendant’s contribution for \[T\]’s expenses (and correspondingly the quantum of \[T\]’s expenses) would _at least_ be $1,800.

143    To that end, and in considering the parties’ submissions, I was not inclined to accept that the son’s reasonable expenses (and correspondingly the defendant’s contribution), _being final orders_, to be $990. Such a figure, is, to my mind, one devoid of any meaningful reality.

144    That being said, I was also not inclined to accept all of the expenses listed by the plaintiff, especially some of the increases since OSG 61. In this connection, I was not inclined to accept, among other things, the plaintiff’s inclusion of the expenses relating to holidays (which parties would be spending on their own accord when they have holidays with both children based on the access orders in the Appeal Orders).

145    Without undertaking a pedantic reimbursement exercise as cautioned in the High Court decision of _UEB v UEC_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHCF 5</span>, I was of the view that a more appropriate and sustainable sum of expenses for the son, being final orders was approximately $3,600. In view of the principle that these orders were made to be long lasting (at least up to when the son reached 21), I was prepared to make some prospective adjustments, and round the figure to $4,000.

146    On that basis, and on the plaintiff’s own submission on the contribution sought (which I found reasonable at the present time, so as to allow time for the plaintiff to restart her life and get back on her feet), I was inclined to order that the defendant pay the plaintiff child maintenance of $2,300 for the younger son. This was a moderate increase of $500 from the Appeal Orders. The payment terms (ie, date and account in which payment is to be made) for such maintenance may be similar to paragraph 14(b) of the Appeal Orders.

147    I turn to the last point of backdating. After assessing the plaintiff’s submission, I was not inclined to backdate the effective date of this child maintenance order. By virtue of my orders in OSG 61 (and subsequently the Appeal Orders), \[T\]’s expenses were being taken care of. Put another way, there was already a subsisting order which deal with \[T\]’s expenses. This was _not_ a situation where the plaintiff was completely out of pocket for such expenses. While I eventually increased the sum, this increase was to take into account the final nature of these orders, and to factor in \[T\]’s expenses up to the age of 21. Therefore, the adjustment was not meant to ‘top up’ deficiencies of the past, but to factor in changes in \[T\]’s expenses for the future.

### Issue 4: Other Orders Relating to the Children

148    For completeness, I deal with other matters relating to the children. In terms of the custody, care and control, and access of the children, I had highlighted earlier that parties have agreed continue to be bound by the Appeal Orders. On that basis, and for avoidance of doubt, paragraphs 1 to 13, 15, and 16 of the Appeal Orders continue to apply.

149    In particular, I wish to underscore the orders made at paragraph 15 of the Appeal Orders insofar as parties and the two children are mandated to undergo a counselling programme with a Divorce Support Specialist Agency (“DSSA”). I left it to parties and their respective counsels to make the necessary arrangements with the DSSA to kick-start this process. When dealing with SUM 361, I understood from counsel that this was being done.

150    Lastly, in terms of the DSSA counselling orders, the Appeal Orders provided for a date for parties to return to review the care and control orders. At the hearing of SUM 361, parties were broadly in agreement that a review would only be meaningful until after the DSSA prepares its report on this issue. I similarly agreed, and provided the review to take place in October 2020, or such other time where the parties and the children have commenced and substantially completed counselling for a report to be prepared for such review, whichever date was earlier. I also granted parties’ liberty to write in to court to make any adjustments in the timelines if necessary.

## Costs

151    After giving my orders, I invited parties to try and reach an agreement on costs, failing which to provide their submissions on the same. Before the expiry of the timeline to provide such submissions, the defendant filed his appeal against my orders.

## Conclusion

152    Last but not least, I wish to thank Ms Huang and Mr Liew for their assistance and submissions on this matter.
