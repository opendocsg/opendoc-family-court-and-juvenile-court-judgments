Section 69 (Cap 353)- Maintenance for child

9 March 2020

### District Judge Wendy Yu:

#### Introduction

1       The Parties in these proceedings, VBX (“the Complainant”) and VBY (“the Respondent”) are medical doctors and were married on xx xxx 2015. They have a 2 year old daughter, \[T\], who was born on xx xxx 2017 (“the Child”).

2       Parties remain embroiled in an extremely acrimonious relationship. The Respondent had filed for divorce (Dxxx of 2019) on 24 January 2019. Parties had filed cross OSG applications (OSG xx7/2018 and OSG xx8/2018) for, _inter alia_, interim access to the Child and an order for interim custody care and control was made on 12 July 2019. Various applications to the Court resulted out of their marital conflict, including no less than 13 applications for personal protection orders (“PPO”) by parties themselves and/or their extended family as well as an application for committal for breach of access orders.

3       The current application is for interim maintenance for the Complainant and Child under s 69 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353) (‘the Charter’). Both parties were in person. While the application was filed on 3 October 2018, the matter was only heard later due to the multiple contemporaneous applications, including cross applications for discovery (e.g. APP xx1/2019 and APP xx7/2019) in these MSS proceedings which had to be heard before the substantive application was heard. The MSS hearing could also only be heard after the OSG hearings were heard as the determination of the issue of care and control will have a bearing on the amount of maintenance payable. The Respondent had filed yet another discovery application on 7 December 2019 (APP xxx9/2019), right before the final hearing on 10 December 2019. I had dismissed this discovery application as I was of the view that the discovery was not necessary for the fair disposal of the matter, especially it was already at the final hearing, and granting the application would mean even further delay in the proceedings.

#### Background

4       The Complainant had moved out of the matrimonial home, bringing the Child with her on 25 December 2017. In her application filed on 3 October 2018, the Complainant claimed for a monthly maintenance of $1,000 for herself and $3,000 for the Child and stated that the Respondent had neglected or refused to provide her with the maintenance for the Child and her since 16 July 2017[^1]. The Complainant had subsequently lowered the amount requested for and stated that she was asking $1,000 for herself and $2,000 for the Child in her affidavit[^2].

#### Orders Made

5       After hearing the parties, I made the following orders on 10 December 2019:

> (a)     The Respondent is to pay the Complainant a total of $1,000 per month as maintenance for the Child.

> (b)     The above-mentioned maintenance is to be paid on or before the last day of each month with effect from 31 October 2018 and is to be deposited by the Respondent into the Complainant’s POSB Bank account number xxx.

> (c)     In addition, the Respondent shall also pay the Complainant the sum of $1,100 each month for the rental expenses of the Child with effect from 30 April 2019 and thereafter on the last day of each month, into the above bank account.

> (d)     The Respondent shall pay the Complainant the arrears of $17,300 for backdated maintenance in a lump sum by 31 March 2020, into the above bank account.

6       I did not order any maintenance for the Complainant as she was gainfully employed as a medical doctor and she has confirmed at the hearing that her current monthly salary was about $9,938.00[^3]. The Complainant did not file any appeal in this regard so I will not elaborate further on this aspect of my decision.

#### Appeal

7       The Respondent has appealed against my entire order. I now give my reasons for the decision.

#### The Law

8       Accordingly, the issues to be determined in this case are:

> (i)     What amount is to be reasonable maintenance for the Child applying the factors in section 69(4) of the Charter,

> (ii)     Whether the Complainant had proved on a balance of probabilities that the Respondent had neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the Child;

> (iii)     Whether the maintenance for the Child should be from the date of the order or backdated to the date when the application was made.

9       I will state the relevant law according to the above issues.

#### (i)    What would amount to reasonable maintenance for the Child applying the factors in Section 69(4) of the Charter

10     Under section 69(4) of the Charter, the Court, when ordering maintenance, shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the following matters:

> (a)     the financial needs of the wife, incapacitated husband or child;

> (b)     the income, earning capacity (if any), property and other financial resources of the wife, incapacitated husband or child;

> (c)     any physical or mental disability of the wife, incapacitated husband or child;

> (d)     the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage;

> (e)     the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family;

> (f)     the standard of living enjoyed by the wife or child or incapacitated husband before the husband or parent, as the case may be, neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the wife or child;

> (g)     in the case of a child, the manner in which he was being, and in which the parties to the marriage expected him to be, educated or trained; and

> (h)     the conduct of each of the parties to the marriage, if the conduct is such that it would in the opinion of the court be inequitable to disregard it.

11     It is also clear that both parents have a duty to maintain the child of the marriage as stated in S68 of the Charter.

> **_Duty of parents to maintain children_**

> _68_.     _Except where an agreement or order of court otherwise provides, it shall be the duty of a parent to maintain or contribute to the maintenance of his or her children, whether they are in his or her custody or the custody of any other person, and whether they are legitimate or illegitimate, either by providing them with such accommodation, clothing, food and education as may be reasonable having regard to his or her means and station in life or by paying the cost thereof._

12     While Section 69(4) of the Charter makes reference to the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources of the recipient of the maintenance and not of the paying party, nevertheless, as the financial capacity of the paying party is relevant it can be taken into consideration under the “all the circumstances of the case” limb in the provision (see _TBC v TBD_, <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 130</span> at \[18-19\] (“_TBC v TBD_”)). In the determination of what is a reasonable amount of maintenance payable by a party for the child, a party’s salary should not be the only factor to take into consideration and the entirety of the circumstances has to be taken into account in assessing reasonable maintenance. As explained in _TBC v TBD_, in assessing a party’s financial capacity there is no reason to use the parties’ monthly salaries alone to determine the contribution they are to make for the child’s maintenance. The Court can take into consideration, as provided in Section 69(4)(b), factors including a party’s income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources, including liabilities and commitments.

13     In the recent High Court decision of _UHA v UHB <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHCF 12</span>_ (_“UHA v UHB”)_ cited by the Respondent, Justice Debbie Ong has opined in her judgment that both parents are equally responsible for providing for their children, but their precise obligations may differ depending on their means and capabilities.[^4]

#### (ii)    Whether the Complainant had proved on a balance of probabilities that the Respondent had neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the Child;

S69(2) of the Charter provides as follows:

> _69(2) The Court may, on due proof that a parent has neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for his child who is unable to maintain himself, order that parent to pay a monthly allowance or a lump sum for the maintenance of that child._

#### (iii)    Whether the maintenance for the Child should be from the date of the order or backdated to the date when the application was made.

14     On the issue of backdating, the authorities indicate that backdating of maintenance is allowed in the judge’s discretion. The Court will take into consideration the parties’ financial circumstances when deciding whether to do so: see _AJE v AJF_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 3 SLR 1177</span> (“_AJE v AJF_”).

15     The Court in _AJE v AJF_ stated at \[26\] and \[27\]:

> _“26_.     _When a maintenance order is made, the operative date of the order is provided. It is usually one of the following:_

>> (_a_)     _the date from which the defendant had failed to pay proper maintenance;_

>> (_b_)     _the date of the filing of the maintenance application;_

>> (_c_)     _the date of the order;_

>> (_d_)     _the month following the date of the order._

> _27_.     _The determination of the operative date is governed by the facts of each case. If the applicant had to incur debts or sell possessions to make up for the shortfall in maintenance, that would be a strong ground for backdating the maintenance. On the other hand, if the applicant had been able to manage with the pre-order maintenance, back-payment would be a windfall, and the case for backdating would be weaker.”_

## The Complainant’s Case

16     The Complainant had filed two affidavits (one dated 18 December 2018 marked as “C-1”, another dated 24 April 2019 marked as “C-2”) in these proceedings. The Complainant had also updated her payslips and tendered them at the hearing of 18 October 2019 (“C-3”).

17     The Complainant has asserted that the Respondent had failed to maintain the Child and her since she moved out of the matrimonial home on 25 December 2017.[^5] Both parties had agreed that as at 10 December 2019, the Respondent had paid the Complainant $5,500 in total as maintenance for the Child[^6]. The Complainant submitted that there had been a prolonged period of non-maintenance of the Child[^7] and that the Respondent had left her to maintain the Child solely for a prolonged period of time.[^8]

18     The Complainant’s case is that the Respondent has the means to maintain the Child but failed to do so. The Respondent’s total income for the Notice of Assessment dated 7 May 2018 was $96,098 which meant that his monthly income was $8,008 per month.[^9]

19     The Complainant stated that she had to pay $2,200 per month as rental for the place that the Child and her were currently staying at[^10]. The tenancy commenced on 20 April 2019 and will be ending on 19 April 2020[^11]. The Complainant has stated that she was willing to move back to the matrimonial home with the Child but had to look for a rental unit to live with the Child because she was under the impression that the Respondent had moved into the matrimonial flat[^12]. While the Respondent had offered the Complainant to move back to the matrimonial home before that[^13], it was on the basis that the Respondent would be moving back in there as well[^14]. This was not feasible as parties were then in the midst of a PPO trial and the Complainant was concerned for her safety and the safety of the Child if parties moved back to live under the same roof again. The Complainant subsequently discovered that the Respondent had rented out the matrimonial home [^15] without her consent even though the matrimonial home was jointly owned by both of them[^16]. The Respondent had kept all the rental proceeds of the matrimonial home since it was rented out in January 2019.[^17]

20     The Complainant has affirmed at the hearing that her current salary is at about $9,938[^18], which excluded any additional working hours which she may take up on her own.

21     The Complainant has also challenged the Respondent’s claim that his monthly expenses amounted to more than $12,000 when he is not even maintaining the Child.[^19] The Complainant has alleged that the Respondent had “put in a lot of amounts everywhere” to “raise up” his monthly expenses in the hope that he could reduce the amount of maintenance that he has to pay for the Child[^20].

22     The Complainant has set out her monthly expenses[^21] as follows:

## The Respondent’s Case

24     The Respondent had filed 3 affidavits[^26] in these proceedings. He had also updated his payslips which was admitted and marked as “R-4” at the hearing on 18 October 2019. The Respondent has argued that he had spent whatever he could on the Child[^27] and that the Complainant did not inform him about the expenses she had incurred for the Child[^28]. The Respondent submitted that he had directly contributed $23,000 to the child in terms of expenses such as antenatal care, postnatal care, delivery expenses and that he had incurred about $16,000 for the renovations[^29]. The Respondent has declared his take home as $4,500[^30] after CPF deductions in his affidavit of 19 December 2018. He had then updated the Court on his current salary when he submitted his latest payslips at the hearing of 18 October 2019. Page 3 of “R-4” showed that the Respondent’s nett pay in August 2019 was $8,255.16 while his nett pay for July 2019 was $7,522. The Respondent stated that his salary included some “back pay”[^31].

25     The Respondent has disputed the expenses of the Child declared by the Complainant and has stated that the expenses were “exaggerations of reality” and not “backed by facts”.[^32]

26     The Respondent has submitted that if the Court is inclined to order any maintenance for the Child, it should only be $750 per month.[^33]

27     The Respondent’s case is that he was unable to afford to pay more than $750 per month for maintenance for the Child and he has declared his monthly expenses per month[^34] as follows:

28     The Respondent had, in his submissions, cited the case of _UHA v UHB_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHCF 12</span> (“_UHA v UHB_”) stating that the Court should take into consideration factors stated at S69(4) of the Charter, including the contributions made by each party to the marriage, to the welfare of the family, and “contributions made by looking after the house or caring for the family”.[^35] The Respondent had also cited _UHA v UHB_ to submit that “there should be a reasonability in terms of satisfying that 1 parent has neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the child”[^36] and submitted that the Complainant kept the Child to herself without requesting for any maintenance.

### My Decision

#### (i)    What would amount to reasonable maintenance for the Child applying the factors in Section 69(4) of the Charter

29     The assessment of reasonableness of the maintenance for the Child is dependent on all the facts of circumstances of the case.

30     Having considered the evidence, I was of the view that the Complainant’s claim that the expenses of a 2 year old child amounts to $5,666.30 is certainly on a high side, even as I consider the standard of living enjoyed by the Child.

31     I would accord the same scrutiny towards the Respondent’s declared monthly expenses of more than $12,000 and consider these figures exaggerated and inflated.

32     I had accepted the evidence that the Complainant had to rent a place with the Child since April 2019[^37], for the monthly sum of $2,200. The Respondent had been renting the matrimonial home out since January 2019. The Respondent should therefore pay for half the rental of the Complainant’s rental apartment as contribution of the Child’s rental, to be back-dated to April 2019 when the Complainant had started to pay such rental. This rental expense would not have been necessary had the Respondent not rented the matrimonial flat out without the Complainant’s consent. I also noted that the Respondent had benefitted from a rental income of $2,000 a month for the rental of the matrimonial home since January 2019[^38], paid to his account[^39]. The Respondent had commented in “R-1” on the Complainant’s claim of $1,000 for the Child’s rental expenses that “(t)his expense is not necessary if she moves back to the matrimonial home”[^40]. It was no longer possible for the Complainant to move back to the matrimonial home with the Child as the Respondent had already rented the matrimonial home out since January 2019. The reasonable maintenance for the Child should include the Child’s rental expenses as the Child will need a roof over her head, unless the Respondent could provide a feasible alternative.

33     I did not include the Complainant’s delivery expenses which she sought as the Complainant had confirmed during the hearing that she had already sought reimbursement of her delivery expenses from her then employers.[^41]

34     While I accepted the evidence that the Helper was employed mainly for the care of the Child, I also noted that the Helper did perform chores for the Complainant such as cleaning the house and washing the Complainant’s clothes.[^42] In view of this, I have only included part of the Helper’s salary and Levy as the Child’s expenses. These expenses were included (even though only partially) as there was evidence that the Respondent had paid for the maid agency fees in May 2017[^43], which would be evidence of the standard of living enjoyed by the Child before the Respondent stopped contributing to the Child’s expenses, which is factor that the Court may take into consideration in S69(4) of the Charter.

35     One factor that the Court may consider is the manner in which the parties to the marriage expected the Child to be educated or trained. With regard to the claim of $1,188 as school fees for \[E\] Pre-school, there has been a dispute as to whether the Respondent’s agreement was sought on enrolling the Child in this school in August 2019, especially when as at July 2019, the Court had already ordered that parties share joint custody of the Child on an interim basis. There was insufficient evidence that the Complainant had sought the consent of the Respondent on enrolling the child at \[E\] Pre-School. In view of this, I had included $600 as a reasonable expense for the Child’s schooling expenses.

36     Having considered the evidence and adopting a broad brush approach, I am of the view that the Child’s reasonable monthly expenses would amount to $2,000 per month (excluding rental), calculated as follows:

37     I have adopted a global view of quantum rather than calculate to the last cent how much was needed: see _Chia Puay Hoong v Ng Hoon Teik_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] SGDC 41</span> at paragraph \[43\] and \[66\].

38     The Complainant has affirmed at the hearing that her current monthly salary is in the region of $9,938[^46], which excludes any additional working hours which she may take up on her own. As stated earlier, the Respondent’s nett pay in August 2019 was $8,255.16 while his nett pay for July 2019 was $7,522. The Respondent’s total income for the Notice of Assessment dated 7 May 2018 was $96,098, which meant that his monthly income was $8,008 per month.[^47] This is a reflection of parties’ earning capacity, and while I note that the Complainant was earning more than the Respondent, there was not much of a significant difference in their income or earning capacity. Both parties were gainfully employed as doctors, and while the Complainant earned more than the Respondent, the Respondent has been receiving a regular monthly rental income of $2,000 from the rental of the matrimonial home, which would constitute a financial resource of the Respondent which the Court is empowered to consider under S69(4) of the Charter.

39     While the Respondent has highlighted that he has to meet the mortgage payments for the matrimonial home from the rental income, I note that the mortgage payment of $1,926 per month is from his CPF account[^48] and funds from his CPF account can be used to meet these payments.

40     The Respondent had declared his monthly expenses to be more than $12,000, including $2,000[^49] to repay his parents for a loan for the payment of the matrimonial home. Such repayment, while important, should not take priority over the needs of the Child. The Respondent had confirmed at the hearing on 10 December 2019 that his expenses that was declared in his affidavit amounting to more than $12,000 have actually been reduced because he has “actually fulfilled some of the expenses” and that some of the instalment plans would have “ceased” by the time of the hearing.[^50]

41     As explained in _TBC v TBD_, in assessing a party’s financial capacity there is no reason to use the parties’ monthly salaries alone to determine the contribution they are to make for the Child’s maintenance. The Court can take into consideration, as provided in Section 69(4)(b), factors including a party’s income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources, including liabilities and commitments. A party’s salary should not be the only factor to be considered and the entirety of the circumstances has to be taken into account in assessing what would amount to reasonable maintenance. The ability to pay by the paying party must be considered but such ability to pay should not be entirely based on his/her salary alone. The financial capacity of the paying party is relevant as it can be taken into consideration under the “all the circumstances of the case” limb in the provision (see \[18\] of _TBC v TBD_).

42     I am guided by Section 68 of the Charter, and taking into account all the circumstances of the case, both parties should shoulder the expenses of the child equally. I am of the view that a monthly sum of $1,000 is a reasonable sum for the Respondent to pay to the Complainant for the expenses of the Child. In addition, the Respondent is to pay the Complainant a monthly sum of $1,100 for the Child’s rental expenses, from April 2019, when the Complainant started making such payments.

43     This figure is certainly not too far from the figure of $1,000 which the Respondent stated in his own affidavit that he had previously offered the Complainant to “assist” the Complainant financially[^51]. This offer was made with the offer that the Complainant and Child return to live in the matrimonial home. Even though this offer was made subject to the final adjudication of the maintenance proceedings and was never carried out as the Respondent said it was rejected by the Complainant, it would be an indication of an amount which the Respondent could afford to pay. The Respondent had already considered $1,000 as an affordable sum, excluding the need for rental. Since the matrimonial home was no longer accessible to the Complainant and the Child, the additional order for the Respondent to contribute $1,100 to provide accommodation for the Child is reasonable.

#### (ii)    Whether the Complainant had proved on a balance of probabilities that the Respondent had neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the Child;

44     The Respondent had used the case of _UHA v UHB_ to contend that the Complainant had failed to be reasonable in the communication of the Child’s expenses and that he was not aware of the child’s needs or expenses. I am of the view that _UHA v UHB_ would not further his case. Justice Debbie Ong in _UHA v UHB_ had stated at \[48\]:

> _“To find neglect or refusal to provide maintenance, the alleged non-paying party must be aware or ought to have been aware of the child’s needs or expenses. A parent ought to be aware that provision for basic needs would be required, whether or not a specific request for basic needs has been made. But where expenses are incurred for items beyond the usual necessities, it may not be reasonable to expect the parent to pay an undefined and unlimited amount at any time when no or little information is provided, for the purposes of finding neglect or refusal in s69(2). The precise facts and circumstances of the case must be considered in assessing the matter.”_

45     As stated in _UHA v UHB_, the Respondent should be aware that provision for basic needs would be required, whether or not a specific request for basic needs has been made.

46     The Complainant has asserted that the Respondent had refused to pay maintenance for the Child since the end of 2017[^52]. There was no evidence that the Respondent had made any regular provision for the Child’s basic needs or expenses, even though the Respondent had asserted that he made certain payments for the Child[^53]. The facts in _UHA v UHB_ are different from our current case, as the Father in that case had already transferred a substantial sum of money to the Mother in 2015 and 2016 at irregular intervals, and the Mother had even failed to respond to the Father’s lawyer’s request for details on the child’s expenses. The Mother had never communicated any specific needs to the Father and he had to estimate the child’s expenses, which was difficult as they were in separate countries. The Mother had also made an earlier MSS application and had subsequently withdrawn the application. Justice Debbie Ong had clearly stated that the facts in _UHA v UHB_ is to be distinguished “_from the more common cases where one parent, with no funds at all, has to repeatedly ask for moneys from the other parent, who pays only irregularly and/or an inadequate sum. A maintenance order provides the predictability and stability that ensures the child is financially provided for, and avoids a situation where a parent (who reasonably communicates the child’s expenses) has to continuously pursue contributions from the other parent.[^54]”_

47     While the Respondent has stated that he has made direct financial contributions to the Child amounting to $23,601.09[^55], there was no evidence of payment of regular maintenance for the Child’s needs. Save for a few food items, the purchase were more for toys for the Child, but there were certainly more regular expenses that had to be provided for, for the young Child. The Respondent also stated that he had made indirect contributions of $16,925.90[^56] for the Child in terms of home improvement such as anti slip tiles or balance payment for his home contractor. All these payments would be more suitably considered during the division of matrimonial assets, rather than maintenance of the Child.

48     The Complainant had already included a prayer for maintenance in her OSG application (OSGxx8/2018) which was filed in 27 August 2018, before the MSS application was filed in October 2018. There was no evidence that there was any regular maintenance forthcoming even then. I did not make any orders for maintenance in the OSG application as the parties’ evidence that was filed was more complete in the MSS application as the evidence in the OSG application was more focused on access issues.

49     As at 28 August 2019, there was no evidence of the Complainant being paid any further sum since December 2017 as maintenance for the Child save for the 3 payments of $750 (in April 2019, June 2019 and July 2019[^57]), the sum of which was agreed to be an interim payment out of goodwill, on a ‘without prejudice’ basis.[^58] At the hearing on 18 October 2019, the Complainant indicated that there were no further payments for May 2019, August 2019, September 2019 and October 2019[^59] and the Respondent then agreed at the hearing that he will pay the $750 monthly payment for August 2019, September 2019 and October 2019 in one lump sum, by 20 October 2019[^60]. At the final hearing of 10 December 2019, parties had agreed that the Respondent had only contributed a total of $5,500 as interim maintenance for the child[^61].

50     The Respondent, when being asked why he had not contributed to the Child’s maintenance since August 2018 to February 2019, explained that he did not do so because the Complainant “have this chunk of money” and that he was “saddled beyond (his) means whereby (his) expenses outlive (his salary)”, and “therefore (he) could not make any payments towards the child then”.[^62]

51     I have therefore made a finding that the Complainant had proven on a balance of probabilities that the Respondent had refused or neglected to provide reasonable maintenance for the Child.

#### (iii)    Whether the maintenance for the Child should be from the date of the order or backdated to the date when the application was made.

52     The Court’s determination of the operative date of a maintenance order was governed by the facts of each case (see _Lee Siew Choo v Ling Chin Thor_ at \[16\]). It is settled law that it is within the power of the court to make an order which would take effect from the date of the application and not the date when the order was made: _Sengol v De Witt \[1985-1986\]_ SLR (R) 809.

53     As stated in the case of _AJE v AJF_, one factor that would offer strong ground for back dating is if a party had to take up loans to make up the shortfall in maintenance. I am satisfied that the Complainant had to take up various loans[^63] to make ends meet[^64] in order to support the Child without any regular maintenance from the Respondent.

54     I have therefore exercised my discretion to backdate the maintenance to the month that the Complainant had filed the application, which would be October 2018, as I considered it fair and just to do so. This backdating is to take into consideration the expenses of the Child that the Complainant had been paying by herself since that date. I had also ordered the Respondent to pay for half of the Complainant’s rental expenses (as the Child’s rental expenses) from the time when she started renting a place for her and the Child to live in, which is April 2019.

55     I have deducted the sum of $5,500 which the Respondent had paid thus far, from the total arrears of maintenance due to the backdating, so I will deduct the sum of $5,500 from $22,800, which amounted to $17,300. I have ordered that the Respondent pay this sum in March 2020 so as to give time to the Respondent to raise this sum. The Respondent had confirmed at the hearing that he would be receiving his bonus[^65] in March 2020.

56     For the above reasons, I made the orders herein accordingly.
