Family Law – personal protection order – s65, Women’s Charter – Wife maintenance – child maintenance

21 April 2021

### District Judge Suzanne Chin:

## Introduction

1       The parties to this matter are husband and wife and they have a son who was at the time of the hearing 6 years old (“child”). The complainant wife (“Wife”) filed 2 applications against the respondent husband (“Husband”). She applied for a Personal Protection Order (“PPO”) for herself and the child against the Husband as well as a Domestic Exclusion Order (“DEO”) to be granted over the entire matrimonial property. She also filed an application applying for maintenance to be paid to herself and the child.

2       Both matters were fixed for hearing before me. After hearing from the parties, I dismissed both applications. The Wife has filed an appeal against my decision in both matters and I now set forth below the reasons for my decision.

## Background

3       At the time of the hearing, divorce proceedings had commenced. The Wife informed me that she was residing at a shelter and had been residing there with the child since 2019 while the Husband remained at the matrimonial home. She clarified however that when the incidents upon which the PPO was based occurred, the child had been residing with the Husband at the matrimonial home.

## A.   The Wife’s application for a PPO and a DEO

4       I will deal first with the Wife’s application for a PPO for herself and the child against the Husband as well as her application for a DEO over the matrimonial property.

## The Law governing family violence

5       Part VII of the Women’s Charter (Chapter 353) (“Charter”) provides the legislative framework for the protection against family violence.

6       “Family Violence” is defined under section 64 of the Charter to mean the commission of the following acts:

> (a)     wilfully or knowingly placing or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;

> (b)     causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;

> (c)     wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his will; or

> (d)     causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member.

7       Section 65 of the Charter states as follows:

>     “The court may, upon satisfaction on a balance of probabilities that family violence has been committed or is likely to be committed against a family member and that it is necessary for the protection of the family member, make a protection order restraining the person against whom the order is made from using family violence against the family member.” \[emphasis added\]

8       In view of the above, before the granting of a PPO, two limbs have to be satisfied on a balance of probabilities: (a) either that an act of violence has been committed in the past or is likely to be committed in the future; and (b) that it is necessary for the protection of the applicant that a PPO be granted. The burden of proof lies with the complainant in the matter.

## Incidents of family violence

9       The Wife referred to incidents which had occurred on 9th November 2019 and 14th November 2019 and asserted that during these 2 incidents, the Husband had committed family violence on her by causing hurt to her. It was her position that the child had witnessed the Husband committing family violence on her and had been traumatised. She also complained that the Husband had continually harassed her by making police reports against her in July and December of 2019 and had continually texted her with accusations and vulgarities. It was her position that his continual harassment had been with the intent to cause or which is known or ought to have been known to have caused her anguish. I will deal with each of the incidents in turn considering the evidence and submissions of both parties to determine if family violence had in fact occurred.

## 9 November 2019

#### Wife’s version of events

10     At the time, the Wife was residing at the shelter while the child had been residing with the Husband for the entire week preceding the incident. According to the Wife, the child had requested that they all go to the beach together and since her friend whom she considered to be a safe person was accompanying her, she agreed to go to the beach with the Husband and the child with her friend and her friend’s son accompanying. She also informed the court that as she had been granted an expedited order (“EO”) at the time, she had felt safe and protected enough to go on the outing with the Husband. It was undisputed that the Husband went to the shelter with the child and picked up the Wife, her friend and her friend’s son before heading off to the beach. Upon arrival at the beach, the parties headed towards the toilets and the Wife sat down on the beach outside of the toilets. According to her, the Husband proceeded to snatch her phone and run off with it. She started screaming, ran after him and told him to stop. She recounted that the Husband was laughing as all of this happened. She eventually managed to retrieve her phone from him. Hours later when she was sitting on the beach, she claimed that the Husband grabbed her feet and attempted to drag her towards the sea. He released her after a few seconds.

11     Thereafter, the entire party walked towards the Husband’s car to collect their things from the car. The Wife explained that when they reached the car, she sat on the edge of the boot as she was feeling tired. As she was relaxing, the Husband pushed her into the boot of the car and she fell in. She tried to get up but he pushed her in again. Subsequently when she tried to get up, the Husband then carried her, pushed her again and tried to shut the car boot. She was screaming throughout and recounted that she felt very traumatised. She said that her son was hitting the Husband and telling him to stop while the Husband laughed. The Husband eventually let her out of the car boot and told her that he was playing with her. The party then went roller skating together followed by dinner thereafter. After dinner, as the child wanted to go back to the beach, the entire party followed. It was the Wife’s position that the Husband then kicked her leg causing her to fall flat on the sand. She started crying. She recounted that the Husband then went to the washroom. When the Husband came back, the Wife continued to sit by the beach while the Husband took the child to the toilet for a shower. After all of this, the Husband dropped the Wife, her friend and her child off at the shelter and went back to the matrimonial home with the son.

#### Husband’s version of events

12     The Husband disputed the Wife’s version of events. It was his position that out of goodwill, he had invited the Wife to accompany him and the child on an outing to the beach. He had also extended the invitation to her friend and her friend’s son. He does not dispute that he had arrived at the shelter with the child to pick up the Wife, her friend and her child and they had all made their way to the beach together. According to him, when they arrived at the beach, they saw people roller skating and the child was interested but as the queue was very long, they decided to go to the beach while waiting. While on the beach, the Husband claimed that the Wife had passed him her phone to hold while she went to the toilet. As she came out from the toilet she ran towards the Husband to take the phone and asked him why he had been checking her phone. He told her that he could not access her phone as he did not know her password and she took the phone back. Immediately thereafter, together with the Wife, the child and the friend’s son, he started to make his way towards the beach. The Wife’s friend was not with them at the time as she had gone to the toilet. After a while, the boys wanted to play in the water. Before following the boys down to the water, the Husband approached the Wife to ask her to join them but she said she was not interested. In an effort to coax her, he then touched her legs and gestured for her to follow. He denies grabbing her leg and pulling her towards the beach. When she indicated that she did not want to follow them, he left her alone. According to the Husband the Wife was at the time sitting about 20 metres away from the water.

13     The party then left the beach and headed to the skating area where the boys skated uneventfully. After roller skating, they all headed towards the carpark to the Husband’s car. The Husband recounted that after he opened the car boot, the Wife sat at the edge of the boot announcing that she was very tired. The Husband then responded by lifting her legs and encouraging her to sleep if she was tired. The Husband related that the Wife was laughing and he was playing with her. After that everyone in the party got into the car and they drove off to the hawker centre to have dinner together. According to the Husband, dinner took place over one and a half hours and everyone, including the Wife, was laughing and chatting. He tendered a photo of the Wife during dinner to support his account that she was in a good mood and enjoying herself. After dinner, he bought ice cream for everyone and then uneventfully drove back to the shelter where he dropped off the Wife, her friend and her friend’s son.

#### Did the Husband commit Family Violence?

14     Upon examining the Wife’s evidence, it would appear that she was contending that the Husband had inflicted family violence on her with regard to the following actions:

> (a)     Snatching her phone and running off with her phone;

> (b)     Grabbing her legs with the intention of dragging her towards the sea;

> (c)     Pushing her into the car boot and attempting to shut her in the boot; and

> (d)     Kicking her so that she fell down flat on the sand.

15     I did not find the Wife’s version of events believable and I also found much of her evidence to be inconsistent. Listed below are some examples:

> \-    The Wife claimed that she had been willing to go to the beach with the Husband and the child on the day as she wanted to spend time with the child. She also felt safe as her friend who was a safe person was going to be accompanying her. While the Wife states this, she does not seem to dispute the fact that there were many occasions during the day when her friend had left her on her own with the Husband. It was baffling how the Wife’s “safe person” had left her alone with the Husband on several occasions during that day and the Wife did not seem at all concerned about this. In addition, the Wife claims that she had the protection of an EO and hence felt “safe”. Records however showed that on the day of this incident, there was no EO in existence. The Wife herself eventually admitted this[^1].

> \-    The Wife had contended that the Husband had pulled her legs and tried to drag her into the sea. By her own testimony while on the stand, she recounted that this had happened over a period of a few seconds. I note however that in her complaint form, she stated as follows:

>> “When we were seated at the beach, my husband suddenly grabbed both of my legs and forcefully dragged my body along the sandy patch. I managed to stand up but then my husband carried me again. My son then told him to put me down and repeatedly tapped my husband telling him to stop it as he was frightened that my husband would throw me into the sea. I was in pain and he carried the act for about 10 seconds for no apparent reason….”

> While on the stand during the trial, a very different account was given by the Wife and she no reference was made to the son’s responses as detailed in the complaint form. She stated as follows[^2]:

>> “ I was sitting down. I was ignoring him. I was just there for my son. He still came to me. He started to take---just pull my leg. And then I started scolding him, “Stop doing that. You know, this is too much. Why are you keep on harassing me?”

> If indeed her evidence that the whole “grabbing leg” incident happened over a period of a few seconds, it is unlikely that the Husband would have had the time to grab both of her legs and forcefully drag her body along the sandy patch.

> \-    The Wife claims that after dinner while they went on the beach the Husband had kicked her and she had fallen onto the sandy ground. In response to the Husband’s questions during cross-examination, she stated he had kicked her on the leg once. When asked what injury she suffered as a result of the incident, she stated that she had pain on the back of her knee. The following is an extract of her statement in her Complaint form about this same incident:

>> “Later when I was watching my son building sandcastle, my husband suddenly kicked me twice on my right thigh and I fell down onto the sand..”

16     I was also puzzled by the fact that if indeed these acts of violence had been committed by the Husband against the Wife on that day and all this led to the Wife feeling so traumatised, why she did not leave the beach or call the police. Instead of running off, the Wife continued to stay in the company of the Husband for the whole day and stayed on willingly even after the incidents. She even sat in the car with the Husband and drove off to another venue for dinner which took place a period of one and a half hours. Her friend, her “safe person”, also does not seem to have considered that any acts of family violence had occurred on that day as she had done nothing but go along with the events of the day culminating in a dinner which the Husband bought for all of them. Neither her friend nor the Wife thought it necessary to call for the police. The fact that the Wife had willingly sat in the Husband’s car on the way to dinner and had willingly allowed him to drive her back to the shelter lends further support to the conclusion that she was not in fact traumatised by the alleged series of events as recounted by her. The contentions of the Wife that the Husband had inflicted family violence on her that day simply are not borne out by the responses and actions of the Wife.

17     Taking all this into consideration, I determined that the Wife had not proven on the balance of probabilities that family violence had been inflicted by the Husband on her on this occasion.

18     With regard to the son, when specifically asked whether family violence had been committed by the Husband against the son on that occasion, the Wife replied, “At that point no”[^3]. Based on this I would conclude that the Husband had on this occasion also not inflicted family violence on the son.

## 14 November 2019

#### Wife’s version

19     According to the Wife, she had returned to the matrimonial home as it was her son’s birthday. While she was at the matrimonial home, the Husband had forcefully asked her to have sex with him and she turned him down. This happened in the living room while the parties sat together on the sofa. Roughly an hour later, the Wife headed to the master bedroom and went to lie down on the bed. Following this, the Husband also entered the master bedroom and sat on the bed next to the Wife. The Wife recounted that they then started talking and while they were talking, the Husband pinched her on her thigh and stomach. The Wife then scolded the Husband and walked away although she continued to remain at the matrimonial flat for another hour or so before the Husband drove her back to the shelter.

#### Husband’s version

20     While the Husband did not dispute the fact that the Wife had returned to the matrimonial home to celebrate their son’s birthday. The Husband explained that the Wife had actually returned to the matrimonial flat on the 13 November 2019 as it was the child’s birthday and she had expressed to him the desire to celebrate the child’s birthday with him. Accordingly, he went to the shelter to pick her up and brought her back to the matrimonial home. On that day, the Husband explained that they celebrated the child’s birthday with him by cutting cake and playing games and were awake past midnight. All three of them slept together in the master bedroom.

21     On 14 November 2019, according to the Husband, they stayed home. He contended that it was an uneventful day. Apart from going out to buy groceries and toys, they stayed home for breakfast lunch and dinner and the Wife lay on the sofa most of the time. Again, all three slept together in the master bedroom that night. On 15 November 2020, he woke up and make breakfast for their son while the Wife was still sleeping. According to him when she woke up, she came to massage his feet and told him that she wanted to go back to the shelter to take her things and then move back home. The Husband then drove her back to the shelter and waited for her outside. After a long time, she still had not come out and he tried to call her on the phone but could not reach her. With no response from her, he left the shelter and headed home with the child.

#### Did the Husband commit family violence?

22     Based on the Wife’s account of the version of events, it would appear that the alleged acts of family violence were (a) the Husband “forcefully” asking her to have sex and (b) the act of the Husband pinching her stomach and thigh when she refused to have sex with him.

23     I considered all of the evidence before me and each parties’ version of events. On the issue of the Husband forcefully asking her to have sex, the Wife admitted that shortly before he asked her to have sex they had been sitting very close to each other on the sofa and had been hugging each other. The Wife even went on to say that they had held hands.[^4] It was also not entirely clear what the Wife meant by saying that the Husband had “forcefully” asked her to have sex. She provides no details of his having used physical violence of any sort. I also noted that it was strange that after the Husband had “forcefully” requested for sex and she had declined, she went to lie down on the bed. Her actions taken in context, did not reflect the actions of someone who was in fear of hurt or someone who had been continually harassed. With regard to the Husband having pinched her thigh and her stomach, this was denied by the Husband. The Wife had claimed that she had gone to the hospital for treatment and that she would obtain and tender the relevant medical report to court. She eventually did not as she explained that she did not have the financial means to requisition the report. Even without the medical report, there could have been other corroborating evidence tendered eg photographs of the injuries etc. None of these were provided by the Wife.

24     After considering all of the evidence before me, in this instance, I again found the Wife’s account of events inconsistent and unbelievable. Firstly, if indeed family violence had occurred on 9th November 2020 and she had been so traumatised and in fear of what the Husband might do to her, or even anguished from his continual harassment, there was no explaining why she would have voluntarily put herself in harm’s way by returning to the matrimonial home for not one but two nights even if it were to celebrate the child’s birthday with him. Secondly, if she had been in fear of her Husband committing further family violence on her, why would she have slept together with the Husband and child in the same bedroom for the 2 nights that she had spent in the matrimonial home. Thirdly, if indeed the Husband had pinched her on the stomach and the thigh, given the events on 9 November 2019 as contended by her, why would she have massaged the Husband’s feet and hugged him. The display of affection on her part did not support her position that she was fearful of the Husband. Fourthly, if the Husband had caused hurt to her by “pinching” her, why did she remain in the matrimonial home after “scolding” him. All of these led me to reach the conclusion that on the balance of probabilities, the Wife had not shown that the Husband had inflicted family violence on her.

25     With regard to the child, when asked while she was on the stand whether the Husband had inflicted family violence on the child, the Wife replied in the negative[^5]

## Continual harassment by the Husband with the intent to cause the Wife anguish

26     The Wife claimed that the Husband had been making various police reports against her specifically in July and December 2019 and that this constituted continual harassment She also claimed that he had been texting her with accusations and using vulgarities on her and this amounted to continual harassment “with the intent to cause or which is known or ought to have been known was likely to cause anguish to her”. The Husband denied that he had made the reports to the police with the intent to harass her. He recounted how she had previously left the child alone and he was concerned about her whereabouts and the safety of the child. The Husband claimed that on each occasion, he had tried to call her but had been unable to reach her and in his desperation, he went to the police to file a police report.

27     The Wife had tendered a copy her statement to the police at the time[^6]. Set forth below is an extract from this:

>     “I have all the while been blocking Jay on my phone number. Time to time, I will unblock Jay to see what he is sending me and what is his next course of action. Between 10 and 16 December 2019, he sent me multiple messages asking to talk to my son and for me to unblock him. Sometime around 2.25am on 16 December 2019, he texted me to say “Call something urgent to tell”. At 3.13am, he texted saying “U ever told me Jack is threatening to expose your videos n forcing you take drugs n engage in sexual activities for him to earn money right. Now come forward n don’t be afraid. Thereafter in the evening he sent me more WA messages which I could not make sense of. This is a usual practise since last time. **I am afraid he is hallucinating about things which I have never done…**”

From this statement, it appears that even the Wife herself thought that the Husband might be hallucinating for whatever reason. I note also that in this report, she makes no mention that in filing these reports, the Husband had done so with the intent to cause or knowing that it would be likely to cause her anguish.

28     The Wife also filed a police report on 27 June 2019 where she alleged that over a period of 2 days she had continually received harassing messages and phone calls from the Husband where he had framed her for taking drugs and engaging in prostitution. She alleged that he had asked his family members to contact her and her family. She also mentioned in the police report that she had seen the Husband in possession of substances. Upon examination of the various pieces of evidence tendered, I did not find that the Husband had continually harassed the Wife with the intent to cause her anguish. From the various exchanges he had with third parties, it appears that for whatever reason, he genuinely believed that the Wife was involved in the stated activity and thought he was trying to save her. I also accepted that he had been genuinely concerned about her whereabouts and also about the safety of his son.

29     In view of the above, I had reached the conclusion that the Wife had not proven on the balance of probabilities that the Husband had inflicted family violence either on her or on the son. As I had made a finding that family violence had not occurred, there was no need for me to proceed to determine if a PPO would be necessary for the protection of the Wife and the child. Accordingly, I proceeded to dismiss the Wife’s application for a PPO and a DEO.

## B.   The Wife’s application for interim wife and child maintenance

30     The Wife requested for wife maintenance of $350 and child maintenance of $500.

31     At the time of the hearing, the Husband informed me that the child was living with him and that he would maintain the child fully. As it was not disputed that the child was living with the Father, I did not consider the Wife’s application for child maintenance but proceeded only to focus on her application for Wife maintenance.

32     The Wife was unemployed at the time of the hearing. She informed the court that she had worked in August earning a sum of $850 but had to leave her job as her son had been in quarantine. She claimed that she had taken various courses to improve herself and that she would likely be able to earn about $1,500 going forward, after she had completed the courses which would be by December 2020.

33     I proceeded to examine the Wife’s Expenses. The Wife claimed expenses totalling a sum of $620. She explained that notwithstanding that she was living in the shelter, there were still personal expenses that she had to take care of and these fell within the categories of food and groceries, eating out, telephone expenses, clothing, medical and public transport. The Husband challenged the Wife’s claim and argued that in the shelter, all of her food would be provided for and hence reasonable expenses for the Wife should be no more than $210. I considered each party’s position and determined that reasonable expenses for the Wife bearing in mind she remained in the shelter would amount to $400. Taking into consideration her position on her earning capacity, even if I accepted the Wife’s claim of expenses at their highest, it was apparent that the Wife would be able to maintain herself once she is able to find a job. I also was of the view that there was no impediment to the Wife finding a job. In light of this, I dismissed the Wife’s application for maintenance.

## Conclusion

34     Having considered all of the evidence and submissions before me, I dismissed both of the Wife’s applications.
