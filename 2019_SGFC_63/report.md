Probate and Administration – Time for Appeal-Further Arguments

11 June 2019

### District Judge Nicole Loh:

## Background

1       This case essentially revolved around a dispute between the Administrator of an Estate and the Beneficiaries of the Estate. The Administrator sought orders to enable her to withdraw and make payments towards debts and expenses of the Estate. The Beneficiaries sought orders for the Administrator to return monies she had withdrawn into the Estate.

2       The Administrator was the life partner of the Deceased and the Beneficiaries are the parents of the Deceased.

##### Salient portions of the applications for the appeal

3       It is not necessary to set out the full extent of the applications between parties. The relevant claims for the purposes of the appeal are:

a.     the Administrator had applied for a repayment of an alleged loan of $110,110 owed by the Estate to herself as a creditor. This was disputed by the Beneficiaries.

b.     The Beneficiaries sought the return of the Deceased’s mobile phone and laptop from the Administrator.

##### Chronology of hearings

4       The sequence of hearings is important for the purposes of this appeal.

##### The appeal filed by Appellant

5       The Plaintiff Administrator filed the current appeal on 13 March 2019 stating she was appealing against all orders made on 27 February 2019. The orders made on 27 February 2019 were:

a.     By consent, Plaintiff to furnish a copy of the contents in the Deceased’s handphone and laptop which pertains to the Deceased within 1 month from the date of this order.

b.     Plaintiff to personally bear cost to the Defendants fixed at $3,500 and disbursement at $490.

6       On 15 March 2019, a correspondence was sent under my direction to Appellant’s counsel to clarify the orders being appealed against by the Appellant. On 22 March 2019, the Appellant’s counsel wrote in to state they are appealing against the order with regard to the $110,110 debt, for which further arguments were heard on 27 February 2019. This was further confirmed by Appellant’s Counsel who attended a case conference with Respondent’s counsel on 6 May 2019.

##### The appeal is out of time

7       As shown in the Chronology of Hearing in paragraph 4 above, the order relating to the alleged $110,110 debt was made at the 1st hearing on 23 October 2018. However, I had expressly stated that the orders were to be extracted together with further orders made at the next hearing and time of appeal will run from the next hearing, which was eventually conducted on 18 December 2018. Pursuant to rule 825, the Appellant would have 14 days from 18 December 2018 to file an appeal.

8       The Appellant claimed further arguments were heard on 27 February 2019 in relation to this issue, whereupon time for appeal would then run from 27 February 2019.

##### Were further arguments heard on 27 February 2019?

9       On the eve of the hearing on 27 February 2019, Appellant had filed a fresh affidavit at 5:42pm in the case without any leave being granted. The Appellant also wrote in on the day of hearing at 9:47am to request for further arguments. The hearing was scheduled at 2:30pm and the letter was received after the Court sits for its morning session at 9:30am for the day, therefore there was no time for a response to be sent with regard to the request for further arguments.

10     During the hearing which had been scheduled for the remaining issues of the return of laptop, mobile phone and legal cost, the Appellant’s counsel explained that his request for further arguments were in relation to the issue of the loan of $110,110 and premised on the new evidence found in the fresh affidavit that was filed the evening before. Therefore, the first issue that I considered was whether to allow such evidence to be admitted after I had already made orders.

11     After hearing submissions, I did not allow the fresh evidence. As the fresh evidence was not allowed, there was no basis for further arguments and therefore I did not hear further arguments for the issue of the $110,110 debt.

##### Is the timeline for appeal affected by the request to hear further arguments?

12     This appeal is filed under Part 18 Division 59 of the Family Justice Rules. Within this division, there is no provision for a procedure for further arguments.

13     This is unlike an appeal filed under Part 18 Division 60 of the Family Justice Rules, where rule 839(3)(b)(ii) expressly states that the time for filing a notice of appeal shall begin on the date that the Court certifies, or is deemed to have certified, that it requires no further arguments.

14     Where there is an express provision in an immediately following Division of the Rules which stipulates that time runs from any certification that further arguments are heard, its absence in Division 59 must mean there is no exception to rule 825.

15     This issue came up before the High Court in UHA v UHB , wherein Justice Hoo Sheau Peng stated

“_Division 59 is silent on the procedure or timelines when a party requests for further arguments, and thus, the time for appealing stipulated by r 825(b) still takes effect_.”

16     Therefore, regardless of whether further arguments were heard on 27 February 2019, the Appellant's right to appeal against the order relating to the $110,110 debt has expired and her appeal is filed out of time.
