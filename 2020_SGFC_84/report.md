Family Law – Maintenance – Child

15 October 2020

### District Judge Kenneth Yap:

## Introduction

1       The Complainant in this case (hereinafter referred to as “the Care-Giver”) wished to recover maintenance for the sums she expended in maintaining the Respondent’s child (“the Child”), whom she had cared for over the course of six years. The Respondent (hereinafter referred to as “the Mother”) objected on the basis that the claim was time-barred, either on the basis of the three-year time bar under s 121(3) read with s 74 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353), or in the alternative, by virtue of the six-year time bar under s 6(1)(d) of the Limitation Act (Cap. 163).

2       I found that the three-year time bar under the Women’s Charter was applicable to this case. The claim was therefore dismissed without proceeding to a full hearing of the matter. The Care-Giver has appealed against my decision.

## The Facts

3       The facts of this case can be summarised briefly. The Care-Giver and her husband were asked by the Mother, who had borne her child out of wedlock on 4 November 2008, to look after the Child. This arrangement lasted from March 2009 to 3 March 2015. The Care-Giver agreed to this arrangement as she was under the impression that the Mother would eventually allow her to adopt the Child. However, a short while after the Child commenced her primary school education, the Mother took the Child back under her care. The Care-Giver was devastated. Her attempts to resume contact with the Child were rebuffed, and the relationship with the Mother turned acrimonious. This culminated in the Care-Giver filing a claim on 8 March 2018 to recover monies spent in maintaining the Child.

4       The Care-Giver claims a sum of $36,360. She claims that these were expenses over and above the monthly sum of $400 paid by the Mother towards the upkeep of the Child (this was later increased to $430 from 2012).

## The Applicable Law

5       The Women’s Charter imposes a duty on a non-parent who accepts a child as a member of his or her family to pay for the maintenance of the child. In return, the non-parent is permitted to recover this sum as a debt from the natural parent. The relevant provisions in s 70 of the Women’s Charter are reproduced for convenient reference:

> 70.—(1)    Where a person has accepted a child who is not his child as a member of his family, it shall be his duty to maintain that child while he remains a child, so far as the father or the mother of the child fails to do so, and the court may make such orders as may be necessary to ensure the welfare of the child.

> (2)    The duty imposed by subsection (1) shall cease if the child is taken away by his father or mother.

> (3)    Any sums expended by a person maintaining that child shall be recoverable as a debt from the father or mother of the child.

6       The Mother does not dispute the arrangement of care in this case. She objects on the basis that the claim is time-barred, and also disputes the quantum of expenses. The argument of time-bar is founded on s 121(3) of the Women’s Charter (under Part X on Divorce), which specifies that any arrears of unsecured maintenance that have accrued more than three years before the institution of a suit are unrecoverable. The time-bar is applicable to Part VIII (Maintenance of Wife, Incapacitated Husband and Children) of the Women’s Charter by virtue of s 74, which specifies that s 121 applies, with the necessary modifications, to any order for maintenance made under Part VIII, which would include a claim by a care-giver for maintenance under s 70(3). The relevant provisions are reproduced as follows:

> Section 121(1) and (3) of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353)

> 121.—(1)    Subject to subsection (3), arrears of unsecured maintenance, whether payable by arrangement or under an order of court, shall be recoverable as a debt from the defaulter and, where they accrued due before the making of a bankruptcy order against the defaulter, shall be provable in the defaulter’s bankruptcy and, where they accrued due before the defaulter’s death, shall be a debt due from the defaulter’s estate.

> (3)    No amount owing as maintenance shall be recoverable in any suit if it accrued due more than 3 years before the institution of the suit unless the court, under special circumstances, otherwise allows.

> Section 74 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353)

> 74.    Section 121 shall apply, with the necessary modifications, to any order for the payment of maintenance under this Part.

> Section 6(1)(d) of the Limitation Act (Cap. 163)

> 6.—(1)    Subject to this Act, the following actions shall not be brought after the expiration of 6 years from the date on which the cause of action accrued: …

>> (d)    actions to recover any sum recoverable by virtue of any written law other than a penalty or forfeiture or sum by way of penalty or forfeiture.

## The Date of Commencement of Proceedings

7       This matter was somewhat derailed at the early stage by uncertainty as to the correct forum to commence proceedings. While the issue of jurisdiction is dusted and resolved, it is necessary to delve into some background to ascertain the date at which proceedings should be taken to commence.

8       The uncertainty arose because s 70(3) of the Women’s Charter specifies that the claim by the care-giver “shall be recoverable as a debt”, but did not specify whether such an action should originate at the Family Justice Courts or the civil courts. The Care-Giver filed a summons under the CPC at first instance before the Family Court on 8 March 2018, but was rejected on the grounds that it should have been filed under the civil jurisdiction of the State Courts. When the Care-Giver duly filed her claim before the Magistrate’s Court at the State Courts, her civil suit was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The Care-Giver then applied to the High Court for leave to appeal. Dedar Singh Gill JC (as he then was) upheld the rejection on the basis that 70(5) of the Women’s Charter provided that s 69(4) to s 69(9) applied, and as sections s 69(4) and (5) refer to “court”, this must mean the “High Court or a Family Court” under s 2 of the Women’s Charter. Accordingly, the High Court settled the issue of jurisdiction under s 70(3) in favour of the Family Court or the Family Division of the High Court.

9       The procedural problems faced by the Care-Giver did not end there. The Care-Giver again commenced proceedings at the Family Court, this time under cover of an Originating Summons. In response, the Mother filed a summons to strike out the matter, on the basis that the Rule 20(1) read with 20(2)(d) of the Family Justice Rules specifies that an application to a Family Court under Part VIII of the Women’s Charter must be made by way of summons under the Criminal Procedure Code. I heard the application for striking out and agreed that an Originating Summons was not the correct mode to commence proceedings. However, mindful that the Care-Giver had done so because she had earlier been rejected for filing the correct process (with the hindsight of the High Court’s decision by Singh JC), I exercised discretion under Rule 10(4) of the Family Justice Rules to decline to set aside the proceedings and instead convert it into a summons under the CPC, to be dealt with as a Magistrate’s Complaint.

10     For completeness, the details of the procedural journey undertaken by the Care-Giver up to this point are fully summarised in the table below:

11     The complicated chronology is laid out above to aid the determination of the date at which the proceedings should be taken as being commenced by the Care-Giver. I note that it was most unfortunate that the Care-Giver had actually filed the correct application at the right forum on 8 March 2018, and that it had taken numerous applications across three courts before the matter came full circle on 18 December 2019 and was converted to the original application that had been filed. I did not think it fair to prejudice the Care-Giver for this unfortunate turn of events. I therefore accepted 8 March 2018 as the date that the Care-Giver effectively filed for relief under s 70(3). As the Child was returned to the Mother’s care on 3 March 2015, this would effectively mean that:

> (a)     If a three-year time bar under s 121(3) of the Women’s Charter applied, the Care-Giver’s claim would be completely time-barred.

> (b)     If a six-year time bar under s 6(1)(a) of the Limitation Act applied, the Care-Giver’s claim would be partially time-barred.

## Whether the Action is Time-Barred

### Whether Time Bar under s 121(3) of the Women’s Charter Applies

12     The statutory time-bar under the Women’s Charter is expressed in a fairly unambiguous manner. As a starting point, s 74 clearly states that s 121 applies “with the necessary modifications, to any order for the payment of maintenance under this Part”, meaning Part VIII, within which the right of a care-giver to claim maintenance under s 70(3) resides. s 121(3) then goes on to state in unequivocal language that “no amount owing as maintenance shall be recoverable in any suit if it accrued due more than 3 years before the institution of the suit”, unless the court finds special circumstances to lift the time bar.

13     Before this court, the Care-Giver sought a liberal interpretation of the High Court’s decision in _Lee Siew Choo v Ling Chin Thor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 185</span> (“_Lee Siew Choo_”), which held that the time-bar did not apply to maintenance orders made in the context of ancillary proceedings to divorce. Counsel for the Care-Giver essentially argued that this case represented the thin end of the wedge, and the true _ratio decidendi_ should be that all “fresh” maintenance orders, including those made under s 69 or s 70(3) of the Women’s Charter, should be exempted from the time bar under s 121(3). By implication, this would mean that the time-bar would only apply to enforcement of “existing” maintenance orders under s 71 of the Women’s Charter.

14     I examine this argument by first recapping the facts of _Lee Siew Choo._ The case involved an order for maintenance made during the ancillary matters hearing to a divorce proceeding. The wife in that case filed for divorce on 18 June 2012, and interim judgment was granted on 10 August 2012. She sought a lump sum maintenance for her daughter which commenced from the year 2009. Choo Han Teck J granted an award of lump sum maintenance from 2009 as requested by the wife, even though some portions of the claim in 2009 would have been time barred if such a limitation applied.

15     The rationale for this decision appears to be premised on a practical reality, which is that the divorcing parent cannot evade parental responsibility by being liable only from the point at which an action is taken out. It also ensures that the best interest of the child is met, by giving the care parent the assurance that there would be redress if sums are incurred first for the urgent needs of the child. This rationale was underscored by Choo J at \[15\]:

> 15    The fact that the wife did not ask for interim maintenance for her second daughter earlier does not preclude her for asking for backdated maintenance at the ancillary hearing. A backdated order for maintenance ensures that the parent in default pays for the child’s needs right from the outset instead of from only from the time maintenance is sought. It is a practical and pragmatic tool that, if used judiciously and as the circumstances warrant, can vindicate parental responsibility for a child’s needs. The Women’s Charter is silent on whether maintenance orders for children can be backdated. But the Family Courts have been granting backdated maintenance where the circumstances warrant (see eg: _TEL v TEK_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGDC 229</span>; _TAW v TAZ_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGDC 101</span>; _BEM v BEO_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGDC 328</span>; _ACM v ACN_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGDC 411</span>; _WB v WC_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGDC 22</span>). There are no cases from the High Court and the Court of Appeal on backdating of maintenance for children. Nonetheless, there are principles that can be gleaned from the cases involving backdating spousal maintenance (see eg: _AMW v AMZ_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 3 SLR 955</span>; _AJE v AJF_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 3 SLR 1177</span>; _TG v TH_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] SGDC 172</span>) that apply to children.

16     His Honour went on to discuss the considerations that the court should bear in mind in deciding whether to grant an order for backdated maintenance (at \[16\] and \[17\]). It is at \[18\] where Choo J expounded on whether the time bar under s 121(3) should limit the power to order backdated maintenance. His Honour’s view was as follows:

> Section 121(3) ostensibly suggests that an order for maintenance should only be backdated three years since an order for backdated maintenance can be a way of recovering arrears. Punch Coomaraswamy J, in referring to the 1975 version of this provision (which does not have the phrase “unless the court, under special circumstances, otherwise allows”), alluded to this possibility in _Gomez v Gomez_ <span class="citation">\[1985\] 1 MLJ 27</span>. But Punch Coomaraswamy J ultimately held that he would express no definite view on this point as the question was not before him. However, **I do not think that s 121(3) restricts the backdating of an order for maintenance for children to only three years for the following reasons:**

>> (a)    First, s 121(3) does not apply here; **it only applies in cases of maintenance of an ex-wife by her former husband** _(Elements of Family Law at p 433)_;

>> (b)    Second, it would be unworkable to apply s 121(3) as a restriction on the date of commencing the maintenance order as there is no date of the institution of a civil suit as a reference; and

>> (c)    Third, Coomaraswamy J’s comment in _Gomez v Gomez_ was made in reference to the 1975 version of s 121(3), which as mentioned, does not have the phrase “unless the court, under special circumstances, otherwise allows”. That phrase now permits a claim for arrears before 3 years from the date of commencing a civil suit if required. There is thus no longer any immutable and absolute time restriction even if that had been the case previously.

> \[Emphasis added\]

17     The ambit of Choo J’s reasoning appears to apply to maintenance orders made _within_ ancillary proceedings, i.e. that maintenance orders made within ancillary hearings can be backdated precisely because they are not stand-alone maintenance proceedings contemplated by s 121, and for which a denial of backdating (beyond three years) may compel parties to apply for interim maintenance in the midst of divorce proceedings, which would be a waste of costs, time and resources. Indeed, a perusal of some of the considerations listed by Choo J in \[16\] reveal that the intent was to avoid duplicative applications for interim maintenance:

> 16.    In deciding whether to grant an order for backdated maintenance, the court should have regard to the overall circumstances of the case, and in this regard, the following are some of the considerations that it ought to bear in mind:

>> …

>> (b)    Second, the applicant should give reason(s) for the delay in seeking maintenance for the child/children. Not making interim maintenance to save costs is a good reason in explaining the delay (_TG v TH_ (see above: \[14\] at \[43\]);

>> …

>> (d)    Fourth, the applicant should generally not be obliged to apply for interim maintenance pending the hearing of ancillaries if she is willing or able to wait until ancillary matters are heard. As Woo Bih Li J In _AMW v AMZ_ held at \[10\]:

>>> There is no reason why, generally speaking, an applicant for maintenance should be compelled to apply for interim maintenance pending the hearing of ancillaries. I say \[the applicant\] is compelled to do so because if she does not, she faces the risk that she will be penalised.

>> (e)    Fifth, potential savings in costs, time and resources in having maintenance for children dealt with in the ancillary hearing, instead of having a separate hearing for interim maintenance. The court in _AMW v AMZ_ held at \[11\]:

>>> To claim interim maintenance, \[the applicant\] has to file a set of cause papers. In addition, there will be a hearing for the interim maintenance application. The process is duplicated to some extent after a writ is filed for a judgment to dissolve the marriage and maintenance is sought. Why should costs be incurred and the time of the court be spent on an interim maintenance application if the wife is able and willing to wait until the ancillaries are heard to obtain maintenance? To \[do otherwise might\] encourage applicants to incur unnecessary costs and to clutter the court’s calendar with unnecessary applications.

18     I turn now to Care-Giver’s argument. Her learned counsel invited this court to interpret the underlined words in \[18\] of Choo J’s decision more liberally, by suggesting that only enforcement of _existing_ maintenance orders (i.e. under s 71 of the Women’s Charter) would have to meet the time bar under s 121(3). By the Care-Giver’s reasoning, all “fresh” maintenance orders, i.e. those made in the context of divorce proceedings under Part X of the Women’s Charter, or under s 69 or s 70(3) of the Women’s Charter, would otherwise be exempted. I would add, although counsel did not specifically refer to this text, that this view mirrors the opinion of Prof Leong Wai Kum, _Elements of Family Law in Singapore_ (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2018) _(“Elements of Family Law”)_, where she expressed the view, at para 12.146:

> There is provision in Part X of the Women’s Charter, ie section 121, for maintenance of a former wife by her former husband, to the effect that no former wife may recover as a debt what has not been paid from more than three years before. Although this provision does not apply to maintenance of a wife during the subsistence of marriage nor maintenance of a child and, even though it is directed to the different matter of recovery of arrears as a debt, the author suggests that no court is likely to order maintenance to begin from longer than three years before. It is far more likely that maintenance will be ordered to be given from the date of judgment or only for a short while before that.

19     Having considered carefully the Care-Giver’s position, I confess to having some difficulties with this broad interpretation of Choo J’s dicta in _Lee Siew Choo_:

> (a)     It flies in the face of the wording of s 74, which explicitly states that s 121 (which is worded to refer to arrears of maintenance recoverable as a _debt_) shall apply “with the necessary modifications” to _any order_ for the payment of maintenance under Part VIII. The clear and unequivocal meaning when both provisions are read together is that the time bar applies to _both_ Part VIII applications (i.e. including applications for “fresh” maintenance under s 69 and 70(3) or enforcement of maintenance orders under s 71) as well as an action to recover arrears of maintenance as a debt. Technically, no mention is made of orders of maintenance granted within ancillary proceedings under Part X, which allows for the exception carved out in _Lee Siew Choo._

> (b)     There does not seem to be an explicable legal policy why enforcement of arrears of maintenance should be limited by the time bar under s 121 while all “fresh” orders of maintenance under Part VIII may be backdated to any point. If anything, a fresh maintenance order may present greater hardship to the paying party because there would be no prior expectation of the exact quantum of such liability. An enforcement claim for arrears, however, is clearly quantifiable and within the realm of knowledge of the respondent to such an application. If one were to look purposively at the rationale for a time bar, the protection afforded by a time bar would ironically seem more applicable to “fresh” orders of maintenance rather than the enforcement of arrears. There is, simply put, less of an element of surprise, and therefore less risk of financial hardship and prejudice, in the enforcement of an “existing” order of maintenance.

> (c)     The rationale for Choo J interpreting that claims for maintenance in divorce proceedings would not be subject to the time bar is found in His Honour’s reasoning in \[15\] that a backdated order for maintenance is a “practical and pragmatic tool” to vindicate parental responsibility towards the upkeep of children, and to discourage filings for interim maintenance for children in the course of divorce proceedings (at \[16 (b), (d) and (e)\]). This rationale has no application in stand-alone applications for maintenance under Part VIII, as there are no existing proceedings within which a maintenance order can be made, and no corresponding concern about duplication of proceedings.

> (d)     The rationale for the power to grant an order of maintenance is ultimately to provide for urgent and pressing financial needs of the receiving party, and to ensure that such needs are not deferred due to a lack of assurance that sums expended would eventually be compensated. Hence, a claimant who waits an inordinately long time only invites an inference that the financial need was not truly of sufficient magnitude to seek the assistance of the court. To my mind, the time-bar in s 121(3) seeks to strike a careful balance by recognising only timely claims as indicative of true need on the part of the claimant, while providing the paying party the certainty that no claims would arise after the passage of three years.

> (e)     Finally, and more by way of a post-script, I would add that the Care-Giver’s suggested interpretation of Choo J’s decision is technically _obiter dicta_, as the decision only related to the backdating of maintenance within an ancillary matters hearing, and not the filing of maintenance applications under Part VIII of the Women’s Charter.

20     For the above reasons, the only proper and consistent interpretation of Choo J’s decision that is compliant with the clear and unambiguous wording of s 74 read with s 121 would be that while the time bar in s 121(3) does apply to orders of maintenance made under Part VIII, it does not apply to orders for maintenance made in ancillary hearings pursuant to Part X of the Women’s Charter. The interpretation that counsel for the Care-Giver has asked this Court to adopt would, with respect, be tantamount to judicial legislation as it re-writes the clear and literal wording of s 74 read with s 121(3).

21     For these reasons, I found that the three-year time bar under s 121(3) applied to this case. It follows that, even if the earliest date of filing was taken (i.e. 8 March 2018), the Care-Giver’s action would effectively be time-barred as the last date of maintenance claimed was 3 March 2015.

### Whether Time Bar under s 6(1)(d) of the Limitation Act applies

22     For completeness, I turn to briefly deal with the arguments made under s 6(1)(d) of the Limitation Act. The simple answer to this submission is that the proceedings under Part VIII, being now converted to a summons before a Magistrate under the auspices of the Criminal Procedure Code, would not allow for a time bar under s 6(1)(d) of the Limitation Act as the latter applies to civil claims. In any case, the provision of a specific time-bar under s 121(3) read with s 74 of the Women’s Charter should clearly take precedence over the general provision found in the Limitation Act. I accordingly did not find the general time bar under the Limitation Act to be applicable to this case.

## Whether Special Circumstances Justify Lifting the Time Bar

23     Finally, I turned to consider whether there existed any special reasons to lift the time bar in this matter. The legislative purpose of a time bar is to impose a careful balance between the need on the part of the claimant to exercise a lawful right, and the countervailing desire for certainty and insularity from legal action on the part of a respondent once a sufficient period of time had elapsed. Indeed, Choo J was mindful of the detriment that a retrospective maintenance order would have on the parent in default, citing the following consideration in \[16(f)\] considering whether backdated maintenance should be ordered:

> Sixth, the detriment caused to the parent in default if the backdated maintenance is ordered (_AMW v AMZ_ (see above: \[16\] at \[12(c)\] – \[12(d)\]). It is not difficult to appreciate why this might be the case. On the backdating of an order, the payer is instantly in arrears in respect of the payments due prior to the claim for maintenance. The payer might not have then means to pay, or if he does, at the cost of hardship to himself;

24     It should also be borne in mind that the maintenance regime under the Women’s Charter is founded upon an assessment of the legitimate needs of the claimant under s 114 of the Women’s Charter. If the claimant does not perceive a demonstrable need to file stand-alone maintenance proceedings under Part VIII outside of the context of a divorce, it would take exceptional reasons to hold that the certainty afforded to the respondent by the sanctity of the time bar should be removed. The Care-Giver in this case had every opportunity to file her claim under s 70(3) as expenditure mounted, or at least, no later than when the child was returned. Even if she did not wish to incur unnecessary acrimony, she could have preserved her rights expressly and obtained from the Mother either an agreement not to raise the time bar, or a representation sufficient to raise an estoppel in that regard.

25     I do acknowledge that it is entirely understandable that the Care-Giver is upset and aggrieved that the Mother had denied her the opportunity to adopt the child after creating the impression that this was her intention, and had also denied her any access to the child thereafter, despite many attempts made to facilitate such access. The transcript of a recorded conversation between the parties in June 2015[^1], after the child had been handed back, bears testament to the frustration and hurt felt by the Care-Giver at that point. However, it was also evident in the conversation that the Care-Giver had contemplated the possibility of bringing the Mother to court[^2], although I accept that this was a general threat and she was at that point unadvised as to the possibility of filing the claim under s 70(3). When queried further on whether any such special reasons existed justifying waiver of the time bar, counsel pointed that the Care-Giver had spent the three years trying to secure access to the child, as her priority was to restore her bond with the child.

26     While I am sympathetic to the plight of the Care-Giver, there does not appear to be sufficient reason to absolve her of the need to protect and enforce her rights in a timely fashion, by seeking advice and filing suit at that point, instead of waiting until March 2018, some three years after the end of the custody period. Should the Care-Giver be allowed to be exempted from the time bar simply due to the ignorance of the need to protect her rights, then the limitation in s 121 would habitually be observed only in its breach. I am further mindful that to affix such a substantive and accumulated liability so long after the fact would present serious financial detriment to the Mother, whereas there is no corresponding evidence that the Care-Giver has suffered indelible hardship by the financial outlay in looking after the child. If anything, the continued pursuit of these proceedings by the Care-Giver appears to be an expression of the hurt and disappointment which she has experienced in having a child she considered to be her own taken from her, and to have all pleas for access thereafter to be denied (despite some attempts at mediation even before this Court). However, sympathy for a claimant’s hurt or outrage at a respondent’s actions cannot be considered an exceptional ground sufficient to lift the time bar. Two wrongs no matter how squared would not make a right.

## Conclusion

27     For the reasons provided above, I dismissed the Care-Giver’s claim in MSS 4421/2019, and awarded costs fixed at $2,000 all-in to be paid to the Mother. I was also reminded that in my previous decision in SUM 3501/2019 (OSF 57/2019), costs in the cause fixed at $500 all-in had been ordered. The Care-Giver is therefore liable to pay total costs fixed at $2,500 all-in to the Mother for both matters.
