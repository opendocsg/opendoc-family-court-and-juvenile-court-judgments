Family law – International Child Abduction Act – Habitual Residence – Wrongful Removal

30 August 2019 - Judgment reserved.

### District Judge Chia Wee Kiat:

## Introduction

1       In the main, FC/OSF 47/2019 (“OSF 47”) is an application for the return of a child, \[A\], to the Netherlands pursuant to s 8 of the International Child Abduction Act (Cap 143C, 2011 Rev Ed) (“the ICAA”) brought by the child’s mother on the ground that the child had been wrongfully removed to Singapore by the child’s father.[^1]

2       The mother is a 39 years old Australian citizen and a Singapore Permanent Resident and the father a 40 years old Singapore citizen. There is one child to the marriage, A, who holds dual citizenship as a Singapore and Australian citizen. The child is 5 years old this year.[^2]

3       The mother and the father met in 2002 and the mother had moved to Singapore on 8 August 2008 to be with the father. The parties were married on 25 February 2012 and A was born in March 2014. They live in a matrimonial home at Ballota Park which they purchased in 2010.[^3] The child was born[^4] and raised in Singapore.

4       The mother started working for company \[C\], her current employer, sometime in 2013[^5] and in June 2018 was approached about the possibility of taking on a new role in the company which required her to move to Amsterdam for about 3 years with an option to extend for another 5 years.[^6] This eventually led to the mother moving to Amsterdam with A on 11 January 2019.[^7]

5       Prior to the move to Amsterdam, A was studying at an international school \[SCH\] in Singapore. On 21 January 2019, he started schooling at his new school \[OOL\] in Amsterdam and is in the Maple class in Reception year, the equivalent of Singapore’s Kindergarten.[^8]

6       It is not disputed that the father had agreed for A to move to Amsterdam in January 2019.[^9] However, the father contends that the agreement was for A to be in Amsterdam on a “trial basis”, with A returning to Singapore at specific points in time (one of which was April 2019), and parties were to further discuss and jointly decide what is best for A.[^10] The mother asserts that the father had consented to the relocation of the mother and A to Amsterdam pursuant to her contract of employment for 3 years.[^11]

7       On 1 April 2019, the father received an email from the mother where she wrote:[^12]

> Hi \[father\],

> I thought about it a long time but I think it is in the best interests of \[A\] that we won’t be coming to Singapore for the school holidays. You and your mum are of course welcome to come and spend time with him here during the holidays, I am not travelling to Boston.

> \[A\] has just settled in well at school and has formed friendships and relationships with his teachers. He is happy. I’ve been thinking about him a great deal, I don’t want to confuse him and really do want what is best for him. He has settled in well here and I do worry about going back to Singapore now for the holiday and the impact it would have on him not returning to Amsterdam. We looked at schools, we made a decision to let him start school and I’d like for that to continue for this moment. I am also concerned that if we do come to Singapore, you will not let us return to Amsterdam, as you said.

> It is clear that we have to talk about our future and taking care of \[A\] must be our top priority. At the moment, I feel that staying here in Amsterdam for the holidays is best for all of us.

> I’m sorry.

> \[mother\]

8       On 3 April 2019, the father texted the mother. The texts stated:[^13]

> \[At 7.23 am\]

> I have asked tt \[A\] to be back, as what you had promised. I DO NOT agree for him to stay at \[OOL school\]\] during the school holiday. I want him to be back tis wkend.

> \[At 7.28 am\]

> \[A\] have said many times he wants to come back to Singapore. I promised him he will.

9       The mother and A did not return to Singapore but stayed in Amsterdam.[^14] This led to the father visiting Amsterdam on 17 May 2019.[^15] On 21 May 2019 the father told the mother that he wanted to take A to Paris to see the Eiffel Tower during his school holidays.[^16] The father communicated his intention to travel to Paris on Monday, 27 May 2019 and returning to Amsterdam on Wednesday, 29 May 2019, and invited the mother along.[^17] Due to her work schedule, the mother decided not to join them on the trip.[^18]

10     On 29 May 2019, the mother received the following message from the father:[^19]

> \[A\] have been asking to go back to SG. I will be taking him back to SG. He dun wan to talk now, will have him call you when we arrive.

11     Alarmed by the father’s message, the mother lodged a police report on the same day.[^20] The mother alleges that the father’s conduct is unlawful under Dutch law and constituted international child abduction under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction 1980 (“the Convention”).[^21]

12     The mother called the father many times on WhatsApp and the father eventually picked up her phone call on 30 May 2019 and told her that A and him were back home in Singapore.[^22]

13     Given the father’s refusal to return A to Amsterdam, the mother decided to take urgent leave from work to fly to Singapore to see A.[^23] Prior to her departure, she had contacted the Dutch Central Authority about the alleged wrongful removal of A and was advised to submit a formal application which she did on 31 May 2019.[^24] She departed Amsterdam on the same day and arrived in Singapore on 1 June 2019 and headed home to see A.[^25] A was due to resume school in Amsterdam on 3 June 2019, but was unable to do so because of what had happened.[^26]

14     On 6 June 2019, the father filed FC/OSG 89/2019 (“OSG 89”) for, i_nter alia_, an order that the mother be restrained from relocating A to Amsterdam without a relocation order.[^27] Concurrently, the father filed an _ex parte_ application FC/SUM 1851/2019 (“SUM 1851”) for an interim order that the mother be restrained from taking \[A\] out of jurisdiction pending the resolution of OSG 89.[^28] In his supporting affidavit, the father stated as follows:[^29]

> 6 On 11 January 2019, my wife \[name\] took \[A\] from Singapore to Amsterdam. She is relocating to Amsterdam and have found employment, permanent accommodation (for her herself and \[A\]), a school for \[A\] and even a nanny for \[A\]. I will elaborate on the unilateral steps that \[mother\] took towards her plans of relocation of \[A\] from Singapore to Amsterdam but \[mother\] has refused to allow \[A\] to return to Singapore. I was left with no choice. In late May 2019, I travelled to Amsterdam and brought \[A\] back to Singapore.

> 7 \[Mother\] immediately travelled back to Singapore and she is now in Singapore. I believe that she may be on to \[A\]’s passports and she has access to \[A\]. \[Mother\] can remove \[A\] out of jurisdiction at any time and there is a high and imminent risk that she does so. If she succeeds in doing so, I may not be able to get \[A\] back again.

15     On 7 June 2019, the father obtained an _ex parte_ order for the mother to have supervised access pending the hearing of SUM 1851.[^30]

16     On 13 June 2019, the mother filed OSF 47 seeking an order for the child to be returned to the Netherlands.[^31] For ease of reference, I shall refer to this order as the “return order”.

17     On 18 June 2019, the parties recorded a consent order that pending the outcome of OSF 47, A’s passports and European ID card shall be surrendered to the respective solicitors and neither party shall remove A from Singapore without leave of court or the other party’s written consent.[^32] On 1 July 2017, interim orders were made granting _inter alia_ shared care and control, with the mother having A from Sunday 10 am to Wednesday 4 pm and the father having \[A\] from Wednesday 4 pm to Sunday 10 am.[^33]

18     Pending the outcome of OSF 47, the father made enquiry and confirmed with A’s school (SCH) that there are available places for A. The mother, however, alleges that the father’s intention to enrol A in SCH school is completely mischievous on his part. The mother states as follows:[^34]

> He is seeking to make custodial decisions on \[A\]’s schooling in Singapore without my consent and without a Court order, in order to change the status quo pending the outcome of the ICAA proceedings herein. The fact that A is currently not attending school is brought about solely by my \[father\]’s conduct of wrongfully removing \[A\] from Amsterdam. But for \[father\]’s wrongful removal of \[A\], \[A\] would have resumed his school term at the \[OOL school\] as he was meant to. I therefore do not agree to \[A\] being enrolled in \[SCH school\] until such time the ICAA proceedings, and any appeals that may arise therefrom, are disposed of.

19     OSF 47 came up for hearing before me on 6 August 2019. After hearing extensive submissions by counsel, I reserved my decision to give the matter further consideration. The parties have no objections for the decision of the court to be rendered in writing. This is permissible under Rule 670 of the Family Justice Rules.

20     Having carefully considered the parties’ submissions and reviewed the evidence, I find that the requirements under s 8 of the ICAA have not been satisfied. Accordingly, the application is dismissed.

21     These are the reasons for my decision.

## Requirements for a return order

22     Section 8(1) of the ICAA provides as follows:

> 8(1) A person who claims that, in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person, either jointly or alone, under the law of a Contracting State, a child has been wrongfully removed to or retained in Singapore within the meaning of the Convention may apply to the Court for an order that the child be returned.

23     Article 3 of the Convention, which has the force of law in Singapore by virtue of s 3 of the ICAA, states as follows:

> Article 3

> The removal or the retention of a child is to be considered wrongful where –

>> (a)    it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person, an institution or any other body, either jointly or alone, under the law of the State in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention; and

>> (b)    at the time of removal or retention those rights were actually exercised, either jointly or alone, or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention.

> The rights of custody mentioned in sub-paragraph (a) above, may arise in particular by operation of law or by reason of a judicial or administrative decision, or by reason of an agreement having legal effect under the law of that State.

24     As noted in Debbie Ong, _International Issues in Family Law in Singapore_ (Academy Publishing, 2015) at page 287 (at \[8.39\]):

> Applicants seeking a return of a child from a contracting state must first establish that the removal or retention is “wrongful” within the definition of Article 3. The removal must be “in breach of rights of custody under the law of the State in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention” and that “at the time of removal or retention those rights were actually exercised … or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention”.

25     At page 288 (at \[8.40\]), it was further noted:

> Breach of rights of custody can be established by reference to the applicant’s rights under the law of the child’s habitual residence.

26     To succeed in her application, the mother must establish:

> (a)     that A was habitually resident in the Netherlands immediately before his removal to Singapore;

> (b)     A was wrongfully removed in breach of rights of custody attributed to the mother under the law of the Netherlands and the mother was actually exercising those rights at the time of removal.

27     As noted by the Court of Appeal in _BDU v BDT_ \[2014\] 2 SLR (at \[26\]):

> Put simply, the court of the country to which the child has been brought (in this case, Singapore) is – pursuant to the Hague Convention – concerned _only_ with the return of the child concerned to his or her country of habitual residence from which he or she was first abducted, subject only to the limited exceptions set out in, _inter alia_, Art 13 of that Convention. It is _not_ concerned with the substantive merits relating to the relevant issues of custody and/or care and control between the parents concerned (still less is it a Convention for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of foreign custody orders (see David McClean, _The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction_ – _Explanatory Documentation prepared for Commonwealth Jurisdictions_ (Commonwealth Secretariat, London, 1997) (“_McClean_”) at p 6).

28     There are a limited number of exceptions under the Convention to the return of the child but none of these exceptions are relevant to the current application.

29     As such, the sole question for determination is whether the requirements of s 8 of the ICAA are satisfied. This depends on (i) whether the child was habitually resident in the Netherlands immediately before the removal and (ii) whether the removal of the child by the father constituted wrongful removal under the law of the Netherlands. I shall now turn to discuss each of these requirements respectively.

## The habitual residence of the child

30     The term “habitual residence” is not defined in the ICAA or in the Convention. In _TUC v TUD_ \[2017\] 4 SLR 901 (“_TUC v TUD_”), the court (sitting as a Coram of 3 Judges) reviewed a number of cases and distilled the following general principles (at \[74\]):

> (a)    The question of habitual residence is ultimately a question of fact to be determined having regard to all the circumstances of the case including the joint intentions of the parents, the child’s reasons for and perceptions of being in the new jurisdiction (in the case of older children), as well as the objective “indicia of integration into the social and family environment” in the new jurisdiction. As Ong JC put it in _TDX v TDY_ at \[43\], this is a broad-based inquiry that will extend to a consideration of “how integrated \[the child\] is to the country in terms of the environment, education system, culture, language and people around \[him or her\] in that country”.

> (b)    In general, in the case of the relocation of younger children and in the case of relatively short periods of residence in the new jurisdiction, the joint or shared intentions of the parents can be a significant factor in pointing towards whether there is any change in the habitual residence of the child.

> (c)    The longer the period of residence in the new jurisdiction, and the greater the evidence of integration into the social and family environment there, the less relevant will be the parents’ original reasons, purposes and intentions (even shared ones) for the relocation in determining whether the child’s habitual residence has changed.

> (d)    An intention on the part of only one parent for the child to change his or her habitual residence will seldom, if ever, have weight in this analysis.

> (e)    The principles at sub-paras (b) to (d) above do not derogate from the general point that the search for the child’s habitual residence depends on all the circumstances of the case.

31     It is clear from the above that the habitual residence of a child is a question of fact, and where the child is young and the period of residence in the new jurisdiction is relatively short, the shared intention of the parents is a significant factor in determining the child’s habitual residence. In addition, the court is required to consider all the circumstances of the case to determine if the habitual residence of the child had changed during the period of the child’s stay in the new jurisdiction.

32     In the present case, A is 5 years of age and the period of his stay in Amsterdam is less than 5 months from 12 January 2019 to 29 May 2019. Given the young age of A and the relatively short period of his stay in Amsterdam, the habitual residence of A would depend on (a) the intention of the parents and (b) the objective circumstances.

33     As this is a fact-intensive inquiry, it will be necessary at this juncture to go into some detail the respective version of events as recounted by the mother and the father in their affidavits.

### The intention of the parties

#### The mother’s version

34     The mother recounts that on 11 June 2018, she was approached by the manager about the possibility of taking on a new role in the company. This role requires her to move to Amsterdam for about 3 years with an option to extend for another 5 years. Thereafter, there was opportunity to return to Singapore or convert to a local package in Europe.[^35]

35     The mother was very excited as the move to Amsterdam would be a great opportunity for the family to experience new experiences and exciting adventures. It could also be an opportunity for the father to quit his job and pursue his studies. The father, according to the mother, had been unhappy in his job. The mother shared the good news with the father, who initially showed a keen interest and encouraged her to explore it further.[^36]

36     On 30 July 2018, the mother received her first formal written offer from her company. However, the offer was a local contract. The mother and father were disappointed with the offer and from this point, the mother says it became difficult to engage the father in further discussions even though the package was being reviewed and revised by the company.[^37]

37     In August 2018, the father and mother purchased another property, a 3-bedroom apartment at a condo called The Inflora (“the Inflora Apartment”). The intention at the time of the purchase was to find a bigger apartment for the family’s needs. They had planned to move into it and rent out the current home, which is a smaller 2-bedroom apartment at Ballota Park. As the previous owners had rented the Inflora Apartment from them for 3 months, they could only take over the property in December 2018.[^38]

38     On 28 August 2018, the mother received an email attaching an expat policy and shared this with the father.[^39]

39     On 31 August 2018, the mother received her expat contract. Although the contract was in draft, she shared it with the father as she wanted to ensure that he had a view on the contract amounts as soon as possible and this was important information for them to make a decision around.[^40]

40     In early October 2018, the father told the mother to accept the new role and package from the company. However, the father said that A and the mother should move to Amsterdam without him as it did not make financial sense for him to leave his job.[^41]

41     On 16 October 2018, the mother signed the expat contract. The new role required the mother to be based in Amsterdam for 4 years from January 2019 to December 2022.[^42]

42     After she had signed the contract, they started making plans for the relocation.[^43]

43     On 24 October 2016, the mother emailed to the father sharing the education consultant’s recommendation on schools for A in Amsterdam.[^44]

44     On 12 November 2018, the mother sent another email to the father suggesting OOL school as her preferred school for A and enclosing the school’s parent handbook for the father’s reference.[^45]

45     On 13 November 2018, the mother sent the father an email with flight bookings for a recce trip to Amsterdam to scout for a suitable school and accommodation. The trip was from 24 November to 1 December 2018.[^46] The mother felt it was important for the father to go to Amsterdam so that he was kept well informed and could participate in any decision making.[^47]

46     On 15 November 2018, the mother sent an email to the father to update him for the Amsterdam trip.[^48]

47     On 21 November 2018, the mother asked the father to sign the permission letter for A to move to the Netherlands. According to the mother, the letter was part of the documentation that is required for immigration. The father signed the letter in the evening after A had gone to bed. The mother held on to the letter. That night at about 3 am, the father suddenly asked for the letter back. He said that he was not comfortable and was angry at the mother for asking him to sign it. The mother gave the letter back to him.[^49]

48     In November 2018, the mother started searching for a suitable nanny to care for A in Amsterdam[^50] and arranged for meetings with three different nannies during the recce trip.

49     The recce trip to Amsterdam from 24 November to 1 December 2018 went very well. They visited two of the short-listed schools and also viewed a number of houses and had an enjoyable time.[^51] The father also joined the mother to meet up with one of the nannies but they felt that this nanny was unsuitable.[^52]

50     On 7 December 2018, after they returned from their trip to Amsterdam, the father finally agreed for A and the mother to go to the Netherlands and said that the mother could submit the permission letter, which the mother had in soft copy. The mother asked if he wanted to rewrite the letter and change the wording to whatever he wanted, but he said no. The mother submitted the paperwork to the immigration consultant. The start date for her new role in Amsterdam was pushed back from 1 January 2019 to 17 January 2019 as the permission letter from the father was submitted late.[^53]

51     By then, SCH school had already been notified that A was not going to carry on his enrolment in the school when the semester ended in December 2018.[^54]

52     In or around December 2018, the mother had several discussions with the father regarding A’s Mandarin tuition in Amsterdam.[^55] The mother asked the father to go with them when they moved in January 2019 to help them to settle down and asked him to help her review the Chinese tutors for A.[^56]

53     On 14 December 2018, the mother sent the father an email attaching the profile of a nanny, \[J\], and informed the father that she would like to arrange for him to meet J with her during his trip to accompany them in their move to Amsterdam in January. The mother had earlier met J during the recce trip in November 2018 and that meeting went well. [^57]

54     On 8 January 2019, the mother sent an email requesting that the father sign the agreement for A to be enrolled in OOL school as the company had already paid for his school registration fee. The father asked the mother if this was her decision. The mother says that although the father had already given her his consent for A and the mother to relocate to Amsterdam, he kept changing his mind, one day he would say no and the next day he would say yes depending on his mood. The mother did not engage the father as she did not want him to get angry. As they had both seen the school and agreed it was the better option, she asked the father to sign the agreement.[^58]

55     The mother and A eventually moved to Amsterdam on 11 January 2019.[^59] The mother had booked a short stay apartment on 2 January 2019 for 22 nights from 12 January 2019 (the day of their arrival) and forwarded the details to the father in an email dated 11 January 2019. The mother explains that this was because the housing market moves very quickly in Amsterdam. It was not practical to secure accommodation so early in November 2018 when they were only on a recce trip and have not started to sort out all the paperwork and logistics of their move to Amsterdam.[^60]

56     The father joined them in Amsterdam from 15 to 24 January 2019. During his visit, they arrange to view all the houses that the relocation consultant had shortlisted for them. The father shared his thoughts about each of these houses in an email to the mother dated 15 January 2019.[^61]

57     On 18 January 2019, they went to OOL school together to buy uniforms for A. They also had lunch with J, the nanny.[^62] After lunch, the father told the mother that he felt J was assertive and was unsure if that was best for A. The mother shared with the father that she believes A needed someone who would follow through the house rules she has set. According to the mother, they eventually settled on hiring J.[^63] J signed the contract on the same day for a period of 12 months commencing 28 January 2019.[^64]

58     On 21 January 2019, A started school at OOL school in Amsterdam. The mother and the father went together in an Uber to take A to school.[^65] The same day at 3.10 pm, they picked A up after school.[^66]

59     On 23 January 2019, the mother signed the tenancy agreement for their accommodation in Amsterdam after coming to a decision.[^67] The mother had found this listing online. She had viewed the house alone as she did not want to trouble the father as they had already viewed 9 houses the day before. She shared the online listing with the father and he did not object.[^68]

60     Whilst in Amsterdam, the father had also joined the mother to visit one of the shortlisted tutors together at his home.[^69]

61     The father left Amsterdam on 24 January 2019. The mother and A would be seeing the father again in about two weeks’ time when they return to Singapore for the Chinese New Year holidays from 2 to 10 February 2019.[^70]

62     The mother found a Singaporean lady living in Amsterdam called \[M\] who agreed to go to her house every Monday to help A with Mandarin and also recommended books from Popular bookstore for A’s Mandarin lessons. The father purchased these books in Singapore and sent them to the mother in Amsterdam.[^71]

63     In January 2019, the parties also started looking for tenants for the Inflora Apartment. They had earlier decided that as the father would stay on in the current home at Ballota Park, they would put up the Inflora Apartment for rent instead.[^72]

64     On 2 February 2019, the mother and A flew to Singapore for Chinese New Year where they stayed till 10 February 2019.[^73]

65     The first indication that things were not right with the father was during his trip to Amsterdam from 13 to 22 March 2019. The father planned the visit as they were celebrating A’s birthday in March 2019.

66     The mother had organised A’s birthday party on 14 March 2019 which was held at the park near school after school ended.[^74] During the party, the mother noticed that the father was not helping with the party. He stood back and did not really engage with any of the children or parents at the party.[^75]

67     After the party, that evening the father told the mother he wanted to talk. He then brought up the subject of their relationship and told the mother that it was clear that things were not going to work out between them. He also said that as a result, he was going to take A back to Singapore to live with him for good and he will do so at the end of his trip when he returns to Singapore on 22 March 2019. He also suggested that he might return to Singapore earlier than planned.[^76]

68     The mother became very worried that the father was going to carry out his threat of taking A away from her in Amsterdam and bringing him back to Singapore without her consent. In order to stall for time and hoping that she could persuade the father not to carry out his threat, the mother asked him to let A participate in the school play that he had been practising so hard for. The play was scheduled on 28 and 29 March 2019.[^77]

69     On 16 March 2019, they visited Rotterdam as a family over the weekend and stayed one night as originally planned. Although the father told the mother that she did not have to go given their conversation on 14 March 2019, the mother went along for that trip as she was worried sick about where the father would take A to and whether he would really bring A back to Singapore without telling her.[^78]

70     Between 16 and 21 March 2019, the father and the mother exchanged a series of WhatsApp messages regarding this issue.[^79] The mother refers to the following extracts:[^80]

> **16 March 2019**

> \[2:39:54 am\] (Father)

> Last nite \[A\] was crying in his slp. I am not sure if it is bcos of our conversation last nite. To be sure we dun affect him in anyway I rather we talk here.

When u got the job offer, i am not convinced tt it will work out better financially for us, thus decided not to move forward. I was very sad when you proceed to agreed to the offer without much discussion. It shocked and sadden me even more that you took the job, knowing how bad our r/s is. I rem all the sacrifices you made and everything i did was trying to be a good husband and trying to salvage our marriage. However, whatever i tried or did in the past months only made things worst. I even tried giving you space, but it just made us grew further part. Today my wife hated me so much tt she wldnt want to talk to me or touch me. I am like a plague. No words can describe the pain and no amount of tears makes it better. I am not sure how much longer i can handle tis.

> You said you broke down in tears whenever sme1 asked how you were. I will like to hear from you and knw what I can do to make things better, but you don’t share with me.

> Many decisions had been made against my wish, even though i shared explicitly my tots and decisions. \[A\] had said to me many times he wants to be back to sgp, and I will very much want to do so too. I am not sure if we get any chance to talk abt it as you will be going away, so I am sharing with you again now tt I will bring \[A\] back to sgp. We made the agreement when we were still in sgp, tt we will decide in Mar if \[A\] will stay in \[OOL school\]. Both \[A\] and I will very much like you to be back to sgp with us together.

> I have said many times, i am not sure what i can do to really salvage our r/s, if you can tell me how or what i can do. I will very much do it, as long as it is within my possible means and it does not stop \[A\] from coming back to sgp.

71     The mother disputes all the allegations made by the Father.[^81] However, she did not see any point in engaging in a battle with the father over WhatsApp and therefore did not respond substantively. The mother says they have had countless arguments and circuitous discussions over the same topic during that period and the father would never listen to her or her views. She was also afraid of him. She was afraid to say anything because of how angry he would get and she was scared that he would do something irrational – like taking A back to Singapore without discussing it with her first.[^82]

72     The father left Amsterdam on 22 March 2019 and returned to Singapore alone. However, he was clear that the mother was to return to Singapore with A by 6 April 2019 and thereafter, A is not allowed to go back to Amsterdam.[^83]

73     The mother was very worried about the father’s threats and concerned that he was acting against A’s best interests.[^84] The mother finally decided that in the best interests and welfare of A, and to prevent the father from carrying out his threat in refusing to allow A to return to Amsterdam, to send an email on 1 April 2019 to the father informing him that they were not travelling to Singapore for the school holidays (see paragraph 7 above).[^85]

74     When he received the email, the father got angry and tried to call the mother several times on WhatsApp. He spoke loudly, alleging that the mother had lied to him. The mother repeated to the father what she had said in the email and he responded to say that he never wanted A back in Singapore “for good” and he was not going to carry out his threat that A could not go back to Amsterdam once he visits Singapore for the school holidays.[^86]

75     Over the next few days from 1 April 2019, the father sent several WhatsApp messages to the mother. In particular, he gave the mother the ultimatum and said he expected A to be home by the weekend (of 6 April 2019).[^87]

76     On 6 April 2019, they spoke over the phone again and he expressed his displeasure that the mother had not booked the flights back to Singapore. The mother reminded the father of his threat to her on 21 March 2019. The father responded by asking if the mother wanted him to kill himself.[^88]

77     Given the circumstances, the mother thought it would be best that A and she stayed in Amsterdam during the school holidays, or at least for the time being until things cooled down between the father and the mother and they could discuss matters more civilly.[^89]

78     On 26 April 2019, after not speaking to the mother for about 2 weeks, the mother overheard a conversation between the father and A, with the father telling A that he was going to visit A in Amsterdam in mid-May.[^90]

79     On 27 and 29 April 2019, the mother sent messages to the father asking when his travel dates are. It was only on 29 April 2019, when the mother asked for the second time that the father informed her that he was arriving in Amsterdam on 17 May 2019. When the mother asked when he was leaving, he said he had not decided.[^91]

80     On 17 May 2019, the father arrived in Amsterdam and arrived at the house just as the mother and A were getting ready for school. The father spoke to A and told him that he would be dropping him off at school and picking him up after school that afternoon. When the mother told the father this was not possible as she had not filled up the requisite school form authorizing a non-regular person for a pick up that day, the father was annoyed.[^92]

81     On 21 May 2019, the father told the mother that he wanted to take A to Paris to see the Eiffel Tower.[^93] The mother had initially proposed taking A on a road trip to a holiday park and offered the father his car for this purpose. He declined and insisted on taking A to Paris.[^94] The mother did not join them on this trip due to her tight schedule.[^95]

82     On 27 May 2019, the father and A departed for Paris.[^96] That morning, the mother handed to the father A’s European ID card in case he needed some form of identification for A.[^97] The mother asked the father what time was their train that day and he said 1 pm. When the mother asked about the return train to Amsterdam, the father said he had not booked a return train ticket yet as he did not want to worry about having to rush for a train.[^98]

83     On 29 May 2019, whilst she was at work, the mother sent the father a message asking what time they were heading back to Amsterdam. The father replied with a message to say that he will be taking A back to Singapore (see paragraph 10 above).[^99]

84     The mother recounts how she started to panic and the events leading to the lodging of the police report and application to the Dutch Central Authority about the wrongful removal of A.[^100]

85     The mother recounts speaking to the father on 30 May 2019 where the father told her, amongst other things, that he could not accept that the mother did not bring A back to Singapore during the school holidays in April and his reaction was extreme but he was left with no choice. The father said the mother made things worse by reporting the incident to the police in Amsterdam and he could not let A return to Amsterdam as he would no longer be able to visit A. The father alleged that he would not stop the mother from seeing A but he does not know how right now.[^101]

86     The mother arrived in Singapore on 1 June 2019, after making arrangement to take urgent leave from work.[^102]

#### The father’s version

87     The father recounts that in the middle of 2018, the mother spoke to him about looking for job opportunities abroad. This was a very big surprise to the father because they had just exercised the option to purchase the Inflora Apartment on 11 June 2018.[^103]

88     In September 2018, the mother told the father that she did not love him anymore. This came as a complete shock to the father because he thought they were doing fine and he was happy with the anticipation of moving into a new home for them.[^104] The conveyance for the Inflora Apartment was completed on 13 August 2018.[^105]

89     The father tried to try and work things out. He voluntarily signed them up for a marriage counselling session with the Singapore Counselling Centre. They attended the counselling session but that did not help the state of their marriage.[^106]

90     The father felt that it could be that the mother was showing a “tantrum” by claiming that she wanted to relocate abroad to show her displeasure with the marriage. To the father, it was illogical for them to move abroad at that point in time, particularly when they were going to move into their new home soon.[^107] The purchase of the Inflora Apartment was a big financial decision and the plan was for the family to move into the Inflora Apartment and to rent out the matrimonial home to help with the mortgage payments for the Inflora Apartment.[^108]

91     However, the mother is quite ambitious and has a strong character.[^109] She was eyeing for a position at her employer’s headquarters and told the father that this posting was for a period of 3 years.[^110]

92     They spoke about this and the mother told the father that she was not very optimistic in clinching the job. Despite this, she decided to go for the interview. The father was worried then but because the mother thought that she could not get the job, the father kept quiet about his worry. He even tried to appear supportive, although deep down, he worried about the ramifications to the family and particularly, A, if the mother got the job and relocated to the Netherlands.[^111]

93     The father’s concern became real when the mother was offered the posting in Amsterdam.[^112] What was also worrying to the father is that the mother’s Amsterdam posting did not make financial sense for the family. The entire family moving to Amsterdam would mean a decrease in the total combined household income. To the father, this was an imprudent move, especially when they had just committed to the purchase of the Inflora Apartment.[^113]

94     According to the father, there was no point for the entire family to move to Amsterdam. They have two apartments here in Singapore, with a million-dollar mortgage to service. Furthermore, they had agreed to purchase the Inflora Apartment so that they, as a family, would have more space and that A could enjoy a better environment for cycling and swimming and his other play activities. The move to Amsterdam was illogical.[^114]

95     The father voiced his objections to the mother’s intended move to Amsterdam. She became angry and ignored him.[^115]

96     Despite his objections, the mother went ahead to accept the job offer.[^116] The mother negotiated and obtained a remuneration package that includes A’s school fees. With that, she suggested to the father that A should relocate with her to Amsterdam for the duration of her posting there, i.e. 3 years. The father was not agreeable to this, but the mother insisted. This issue caused a considerable strain on the marriage. The mother effectively told the father that it would be the end of their marriage if he did not relocate with them.[^117]

97     To make matters worse, the mother refused to confirm whether this intended relocation to Amsterdam was a permanent or a temporary one for 3 years. When asked, she refused to confirm that she would return to Singapore after 3 years, and indicated that she might wish to extend her contract or find another job in Amsterdam, all of which made the father very anxious.[^118]

98     More importantly, the father was very worried about his relationship with A. Even if the mother and A moved to Amsterdam just for 3 years, the father was sure that there would be irreversible damage to the bond that he shared with A since his birth. A would effectively live out these few years and possibly more in a “single-parent” family, without the paternal grandmother or their helper \[K\].[^119] A’s grandmother lives with them at the matrimonial home on weekdays and helps to take care of A, whilst K has helped in taking care of A since 2017.[^120] The mother has no family members to help her in Amsterdam and no familial support there.[^121]

99     In voicing his objections to the mother about the move to Amsterdam, the father told the mother that this was a very important decision and his views should be thoroughly considered. The father told the mother that A’s move to Amsterdam, away from him, the paternal grandmother, K and all that A is familiar with here in Singapore is not beneficial to A.[^122] However, the mother was adamant about taking up the position in Amsterdam.[^123]

100    The mother tried to convince the father that it is in A’s best interests to look for a trial school in Amsterdam for him. She told the father that this would be on a “trial basis” only.[^124]

101    According to the father, there was tension between the both of them then and with his marriage on the line, he felt that he had no choice.[^125] He says he has tried his very best to avoid acrimony. He hopes to salvage and work things out with the mother.[^126] In any event, he agreed to this “trial” then because the mother assured him that this was on a “trial” basis only and that they should not deny A an opportunity to have a “trial” at life in Amsterdam as well. The father thus relented and agreed to explore having A have a “trial” school in Amsterdam.[^127]

102    The mother then told the father that for schools in Amsterdam to consider accepting A, the father had to give his written consent for A to “relocate” to Amsterdam. The father believed the mother because he knew she had spent a lot of time doing her research on life in Amsterdam and she was even in touch with professional migration experts and had sought advice from them on the move for matters concerning herself and A.[^128]

103    On 21 November 2018 at about 8 pm, the mother asked that the father sign a written consent for A to move to Amsterdam. This document was drafted by the mother herself without any input from the father. At the time she gave the father the document to sign, she told the father very clearly that this was for A to have a “trial” school only.[^129]

104    The father thus signed. At the time of signing, the father felt very uneasy, but he thought that this was only to facilitate the “trial” of A in Amsterdam and at that instant, he felt assured by the mother.[^130] The text of the written consent that the father signed on 21 November 2018 reads:[^131]

> I, \[Father’s name\], allow my son \[A\] to relocate to the Netherlands in January 2019 with my wife, \[A\]’s mother \[Mother’s name\].

105    According to the father, he signed the written consent only to facilitate A to let him attend school during that three months that A was to be there (from January 2019 to April 2019). The father never agreed for A to start school in Amsterdam on a permanent basis. At all times, A was to return to Singapore in April 2019. The father told the mother and the mother knows that if a decision was to be made for A to permanently relocate to Amsterdam, this was a decision that was to be made by the both of them as parents.[^132]

106    Although the written consent was only for a “trial” basis, the father felt extremely uneasy immediately after signing the written consent. He did not know whether the mother would go back on her word and misuse the written consent that he signed. The consequences were dire – he could lose his son. The more he thought about it, the more worried he became. He became very nervous and anxious and that same night, he asked the mother to return the signed written consent. She did so, and the father kept it in his wardrobe, safe from the mother.[^133]

107    The father is very perplexed that the mother now says that he agreed for her to submit the written consent. He did not. The father is even more perplexed to note the mother deposing to the fact that she had the written consent in “soft copy”. The father says the mother only had the signed written consent in her possession for a few hours. During this time, both of them were at home and there is no scanner at home. The copy of the signed written consent exhibited in the mother’s supporting affidavit seems to be a photograph of the document, taken by a mobile phone. How the mother has a soft copy of the written consent remains a mystery to him.[^134]

108    The father believes that the mother had taken the signed written consent surreptitiously, without his consent or knowledge and had unilaterally submitted the same to OOL school.[^135]

109    The father recalls that sometime in end December 2018, there was an evening which the mother and he sat down at the living room of the matrimonial home after A slept. They discussed the plans for A’s temporary stay in Amsterdam and they both agreed that it was only for a “trial” basis.[^136]

110    That evening, they had with them a calendar. On the calendar, they marked out the significant dates in relation to A for the first half of 2019. The calendar shows:[^137]

> (a)     They marked out the date, 11 January 2019, for A to go to Amsterdam;

> (b)     They also marked out that the father was to go over to Amsterdam from 12 March to 22 March 2019. This was for A’s birthday;

> (c)     Between 18 to 25 March, they were to “discuss \[A\] school”. They also wrote – “worst case of \[A\] coming back”;

> (d)     In July, it was written that “assuming \[A\] cont school in \[OOL\], he will retn latest by 14 July”.

111    The father says the markings on the calendar show that there was never any agreement for the father to consent to A relocating to Amsterdam permanently or for any prolonged period of time. A going to Amsterdam in January was just a “trial”. He was supposed to return in April 2019 or at the very latest, 14 July 2019.[^138]

112    Because the father was expecting A to be back in Singapore by April 2019, the helper K remained employed and he did not terminate her employment.[^139] If he had agreed for A to permanently relocate to Amsterdam, he would have then taken steps to end K’s employment, bearing in mind he was very conscious of finances then because of the purchase of the Inflora Apartment.[^140]

113    Pursuant to the impending move to Amsterdam, A stopped attending his classes at SCH school from 7 January 2019. Thereafter, on 8 January 2019, SCH school emailed the father and mother to ask if A would be returning to the school. On the same day, the mother in her reply said the following:[^141]

> We have advised \[A\]’s teachers that A will not be returning to \[SCH school\] for now. If we do come back to the school, do we need to pay a registration fee again?

114    In an email to the mother on 9 January 2019, the father stated:[^142]

> Hi, I have signed the letter with the understanding that this is to allow A to try out the school. We/I can chose to stop the school at any time with no reason required, and have \[A\] back to Singapore.

115    After the mother and A went to Amsterdam on 11 January 2019, the father made 3 trips to Amsterdam. First, he went from 15 January 2019 to 24 January 2019 to help the mother and A settle in.[^143] According to the father, when they met J the nanny, the father told the mother that they should consider the matter further and not hire J immediately. The father was concerned that J’s previous experience was working at a day care centre, as a humanitarian, and doing social work in relation to children. These environments are very different from being a nanny. The mother disregarded his views and insisted on employing J there and then.[^144]

116    On 18 January 2019, the mother wrote to immigration consultants to explore the possibility of A returning to Singapore before her. She wrote:[^145]

> Hi \[Z\],

> Hope all is well! I left a message for you today, hoping you could answer a few questions.

> Is there any penalty imposed if my son were to return to Singapore earlier than me to live?

> Would he have any issues coming in and out of the Netherlands to visit me if I were to remain here?

117    On 21 January 2019, the immigration consultant confirmed that there was no penalty if A is to return to Singapore earlier than the mother.[^146]

118    The next trip the father made to Amsterdam was from 13 March 2019 to 22 March 2019. The primary purpose of this trip was to celebrate A’s 5th birthday, and to be with him on his birthday. This was also the point in time (as they had marked out in the calendar) when the mother and the father had agreed to discuss whether A should return to Singapore and or how long was he to be in Amsterdam for.[^147]

119    According to the father, A told him repeatedly that he wants to come back to Singapore during the father’s visits in January and March 2019. The father would comfort A whenever he said that he wanted to come back to Singapore. The father told A that he would soon be returning to Singapore in April 2019 (because the mother and the father agreed that A would return to Singapore then).[^148]

120    The father says the mother is aware of A’s wishes to come back to Singapore. Because A repeatedly raised this issue with him, the father would text the mother about it[^149] An example was the text he sent to the mother on 21 March 2019 (see paragraph 70 above). For ease of reference, the text is reproduced:[^150]

> Can we have a talk? Our r/s is getting worst by the day. Not talking and avoiding me is not going to solve the problems. Not long ago, u said u wan to try to make things work, and all changes now. I tried to give you space and it ended up worst. What you want is it really worth it, at the cost of our family? Even if not for me, for \[A\] wad wld u like me to do? \[A\] have been saying he wants to go bk to sgp with me and go to school in sgp. I will like to bring him home with me on fri.

121    The mother simply ignored his text message and did not reply.[^151] On the same day at 4.26 pm, the father texted the mother again, saying that “I will like to buy \[A\] ticket soon. Pls let me knw”. The mother replied him this time, stating that she disagreed.[^152] The father’s text reply to her was:[^153]

> His last day of school is on 4th Apr, u said he will be back once his school holoday starts. I wan him back to sgp by 6th apr.

122    The father says his text message above shows that his agreement with the mother was that A would be back in Singapore in April 2019. However, the mother did not reply him, and she ignored him again.[^154]

123    On 1 April 2019, the mother sent the father an email, stating her intention not to allow A to come back to Singapore in April 2019 (see paragraph 7 above). The mother had gone back on her word and their agreement.[^155]

124    The father points out that the mother’s email shows he did not agree or consent for A to permanently relocate to Amsterdam for any prolonged period of time. If he had consented as such, the mother could have simply said that A would be there for the next 3 years or 4 years to refute him. Instead, the mother said that that she would like for A to continue school in Amsterdam “for the moment”, and “at the moment” she feels that staying in Amsterdam is best. This, the father says, is symptomatic of the mother’s way of stringing him along, step-by-step, in relation to A’s move to Amsterdam.[^156]

125    The father says that the mother first got him to agree to allow A to move to Amsterdam on a “trial” basis. Then she surreptitiously used the written consent that he signed to get A a school without his knowledge and consent, whilst promising that school was a “trial” basis only. The mother promised that A would be back in April 2019. Then, she unilaterally decides that A is not coming back anymore, and that “it is best” that A stays in Amsterdam.[^157] The father is emotionally affected to see the mother do this.[^158]

126    On 3 April 2019, the father texted the mother, again reiterating the fact that A wants to come back to Singapore, and she should allow A to come back in April 2019 as she had promised (see paragraph 8 above).

127    The father made his third trip to Amsterdam on 17 May 2019 and returned with A on 29 May 2019.[^159]

128    The father recounts that he had asked the mother on 20 May 2019 and again on 22 May 2019 whether she could take some time off work to visit the Eiffel Tower with the father and A. He thought the short trip would do them good as a family. The mother said she was unable to take time off work because of her work commitments. She asked that the both of them go without her.[^160]

129    The father says that at that point in time, he had absolutely no intention to bring A back to Singapore. It was only after the mother told the father that she would not be joining them to visit the Eiffel Tower that he then entertained the thought of bringing A back to Singapore.[^161]

130    The father says that during this third trip, A was asking him about Singapore numerous times each day. A kept asking him when he could come back to Singapore and the father simply did not know how to answer him.[^162]

131    At that time, the father was confused and conflicted. He had agreed for A to go to Amsterdam on a “trial” basis because he wanted to salvage his marriage and keep his family whole. Yet, if he were to bring A back to Singapore without the mother’s permission, this would probably mean that the marriage with the mother would be over. He felt as if he had to choose between his son and his marriage.[^163]

132    The father mulled over this issue for two days. During this time, A continued to ask when he could return to Singapore. The father asked A if he would really like to return to Singapore. A told the father “yes”. The father then asked A what about the mother. A told the father that they could go on a “boys’ trip” back to Singapore and he asked the father not to tell the mother.[^164]

133    On 24 May 2019, the father purchased tickets for A and himself to return to Singapore on 29 May 2019, to depart from Paris at 12 noon. After booking A’s air ticket, the father started searching for his passport in the mother’s rented apartment but could not find it. The father believed that A’s passport was lost or misplaced.[^165]

134    On 27 May 2019, the father and A took a train from Amsterdam to Paris.[^166] After arriving in Paris, the father made a police report about A’s missing passport.[^167] The police report is required for the purpose of applying for a Document of Identity in Lieu of Passport (“DOI”) to the Singapore Embassy.[^168] After making the police report, the father applied and obtained a DOI for A.[^169] The father and A then went to visit the Eiffel Tower.[^170]

135    On 29 May, the father and A took the flight back to Singapore.[^171]

### The parties’ submissions

#### The mother’s submissions

136    The mother’s case, as set out in the Written Submission, is that the parties had jointly intended for the mother and A to relocate to the Netherlands following her offer from her employer to take up a 3-year expat contract in the Netherlands.[^172]

137    The mother asserts that the father was involved and engaged in discussions every step of the way and the decision in relation to the acceptance of the mother’s new job in the Netherlands and for A to relocate to the Netherlands with the mother. In particular, the mother highlights the following:[^173]

> (a)     In June 2018, the mother had discussed the initial offer for a new role in the Netherlands from the company with the father when she first received the news from her manager. The father encouraged the mother to explore this opportunity further.

> (b)     On 30 July 2018, the mother received a formal written offer from the company and shared it with the father. Although the mother was to receive a promotion, the remuneration package for her role in the Netherlands was less than her existing salary. Both the mother and the father were disappointed and the mother then tried to re-negotiate the package.

> (c)     The mother kept the father up to date and tried to engage him throughout the entire process.

> (d)     On 28 August 2018, the mother received a revised expat package and on 31 August 2018, the mother received her expat contract. The mother shared all of this with the father.

> (e)     Having discussed this with the father, the father then informed the mother to accept the new role and package but that only the mother and A will relocate. The father took the view that it would not make financial sense overall for him to move as well, as the mother’s income would not cover the father’s current salary. The father had even prepared a spreadsheet with his calculations.

> (f)     On 16 October 2018, the mother went ahead to sign the new contract with the company as agreed. The contract was for the mother to be based in Amsterdam for 4 years from January 2019 to December 2022.

138    In addition, the mother highlights the following evidence with respect to the other aspects of the relocation:[^174]

> (a)     The mother had engaged the father in discussions over suitable schools for A in Amsterdam. Following the mother’s consultation with the education consultant, the mother forwarded to the father the recommendations made by the said education consultant in an email dated 24 October 2018.

> (b)     The mother had arranged for the whole family to go on a recce trip to Amsterdam from 24 November to 1 December 2018, to scout for suitable schools and accommodation in respect of the relocation. The mother had sent the father the flight bookings on 13 November 2018 and the accommodation details on 15 November 2018 via email.

> (c)     The mother obtained a permission letter on 21 November 2018 from the father for A to relocate with her to the Netherlands. It is the mother’s case that on 7 December 2018 after the recce trip to Amsterdam, the father gave his consent for the mother to submit the said permission letter to the Dutch immigration authorities.

> (d)     The mother also explored options for a Mandarin tutor and a suitable nanny for A in Amsterdam. These were all discussed and shared with the father between November 2018 to January 2019.

> (e)     The mother also obtained the father’s written consent on 9 January 2019 for A to be enrolled in OOL school. According to the mother, the father had signed his consent and sent it to the mother via email.

> (f)     The parties shelved their initial plan to move into a bigger home in Singapore, at the Inflora Apartment, which was purchased in August 2018. Instead, they decided to put the Inflora Apartment up for rent in January 2019 and it is still currently on the market.

> (g)     There were also arrangements made to terminate K’s employment as the mother and A were no longer in Singapore. This is explained in the mother’s 2nd Affidavit dated 24 July 2019 (at \[75\]-\[77\]).

> (h)     The father flew to Amsterdam to help the mother and A settle into their new home in Amsterdam. The mother and A relocated to Amsterdam on 11 January 2019 and the father joined them from 15 to 24 January 2019. During this trip, the father was also involved in viewing apartments, visiting OOL school and interviewing the nanny, J.

> (i)     During the father’s trip in January 2019, he had also marked out on his calendar A’s school holiday schedule for the entire year in order for the family to plan their holidays and visits. This is explained in the mother’s 2nd Affidavit dated 24 July 2019 (at \[65\]-\[74\]). For example, it contemplated the following:

>> a.       the mother and A will visit during Chinese New Year in February 2019 (which they did);

>> b.       the father will visit in March 2019 for A’s birthday (which he did);

>> c.       the mother and A will return for the April 2019 and the July 2019 school holidays; and

>> d.       the mother and A will be in both Singapore and Australia over the December 2019 Christmas holidays.

139    The mother submits that there was a joint intention for the mother and A to relocate to the Netherlands and the father had simply regretted his decision later on and decided to abduct A to Singapore when he realised his marriage was not working out. It was the initial plan for the family to relocate to the Netherlands and the father decided not to join the mother and A as he felt that the mother’s remuneration package was insufficient and less than the combined income. Nevertheless, the father still consented to the mother and A relocating to Amsterdam. It was his decision not to join the family.[^175]

140    The mother submits that the father’s evidence is not to be believed. The mother says this is a father who:[^176]

> (a)     has blatant disregard for authority, being prepared to lie and did lie to authorities in Paris and Singapore;

> (b)     is prepared to lie and/or mislead the court by presenting various versions of events; and

> (c)     is dishonest in manipulating evidence and being selective in respect of the evidence he presented to the court in order to paint an incomplete and inaccurate picture to the court.

#### The father’s submissions

141    The father accepts that he did agree for A to move to Amsterdam in January 2019.[^177] Where the father is concerned, the dispute is whether A was to be in Amsterdam permanently and throughout the wife’s posting in Amsterdam or on a “trial basis”.[^178]

142    The father points to the following evidence to show that the parties did not have a shared intention for A to permanently relocate to Amsterdam: [^179]

> (a)     Parties’ purchase of the Inflora Apartment;

> (b)     The written consent of 21 November 2018 prepared by the mother and signed by the father, read with the mother’s employment contract;

> (c)     The fact that the mother herself was unclear as to how long she would be in Amsterdam, with reference to the mother’s draft employment contract and signed employment contract;

> (d)     The marked calendar of December 2018, which states the dates which A was to return to Singapore;

> (e)     The mother’s email of 8 January 2019 to SCH school contemplating A’s return to Singapore and SCH school;

> (f)     The father’s email of 9 January 2019 to the mother stating that A was to enrol in the OOL school to “try out” and that A could be back in Singapore anytime, and the fact that the mother did not reply to this email;

> (g)     The fact that the helper K was retained throughout A’s stay in Amsterdam;

> (h)     The mother’s email of 18 January 2019 (when she was in Amsterdam) to the immigration consultant, showing doubts as to the duration of A’s stay in Amsterdam; and

> (i)     The mother’s email of 1 April 2019 to the father.

### Analysis

143    The mother paints a dismal picture of the father in her affidavits and submissions.

144    The mother says the father did not take to fatherhood well and suggests that he is uncaring and prone to taking out his anger and frustration on the child. In her 1st Affidavit (at \[16\]-\[17\]), she describes the father as follows:

> The moment A was born at the hospital delivery room, I recalled that \[Father\] said to me, “no more kids!” He did not take to the idea of fatherhood well, and over the years, it became apparent that he did not enjoy fatherhood at all. On the other hand, I really wanted to have another child, a sibling as a companion for \[A\]. In order to change \[Father\]’s mind, I set out to prove to \[Father\] that I could handle caring for \[A\] without any help from \[Father\]. Whenever \[A\] cried, or needed to be fed or have his nappy changed, I would be the one to take care of it. \[Father\] would hardly have to lift a finger when it came to \[A\]’s everyday well-being

> \[Father\] is generally impatient with A. I recall an incident in December 2017 when we were driving along the Central Express Way and \[A\] was throwing a tantrum, crying and kicking his feet against the front driver’s seat. \[Father\] got so angry that he threatened to hit \[A\]. He then leaned back and grabbed \[A\]’s t-shirt collar. After we exited the expressway, he said to me, “Having a child was the worst fucking decision of my life and I want to fucking kill myself!” I became very worried and confused as I did not think it was normal for someone to threaten suicide in a moment of anger or frustration.

145    Against this picture of an angry father, there is objective evidence that points to the more tender and loving aspects of the father. For instance, the testimonial from the child’s school OOL, obtained by the mother, reveals the child’s affection for the father in these words:

> \[A\] often talks about Singapore and that he also has another school. He also talks about having three or four homes. He does so in a factual sense but without emotion. \[A\] talks openly about how he and his Mum have been buying new furniture for their home or fun things he has done at the weekend. He gets very excited about family celebrations such as birthdays and enjoy sharing details about them. **\[A\] is aware of when his dad is coming to visit or if he is coming to collect him from school, he likes this.”**

> \[Emphasis added\]

146    There are also silent facts that speak for themselves, such as the father going on a recce trip with the family to Amsterdam from 24 November to 1 December 2018, the father joining the family in Amsterdam from 15 to 24 January 2019 to help them settle down (during which he saw no fewer than 9 houses with the mother, gave the mother his views on each of these houses, met up with J the nanny and visited one of the shortlisted Mandarin tutors at this home), and the father travelling to Amsterdam again on 13 to 22 March 2019 to celebrate the son’s 5th birthday. Amsterdam is far away. Yet in the short span of time between November 2018 and March 2019, the father made no less than 3 long-haul trips to Amsterdam for the sake of the family.

147    The mother says the father did not love and care for her. In her 1st Affidavit (at \[16\]-\[18\]), she describes it as follows:

> Since \[A\]’s birth, \[Father\] and I were not physically intimate for more than 2 years. In order to maintain our marital relationship, I mandated that \[Father\] hug and kiss me each day before he left the house. However, this did not improve matters between us. Although I broached the subject a few times with \[Father\], he would get angry that I brought it up and not speak to me for days after. I recall a particularly bad argument in December 2014 when we were on holiday in Australia, staying in an AirBnb home in Sylvania, when I brought this subject up and \[Father\] started saying things like, “stop pressuring me” and “don’t push me”. I felt unloved and uncared for as a wife because I have a husband who did not listen to me when I expressed my feelings and concerns. It also severely affected my self-esteem as I felt that my own husband saw me as fat, ugly and unattractive.

148    Against this picture of an unloving husband, there is undisputed evidence that the father has tried to salvage the marriage. For instance, the father volunteered for marriage counselling and took the initiative to book an appointment with the counsellor for this purpose.[^180] And as has been seen, he retreated from his initial objections and gave in to the mother’s wish to relocate to Amsterdam despite all his concerns.

149    The mother accuses the father of manipulating the child. The mother says that A started to say he wanted to go to Singapore only because the father had planted the thoughts in the child’s mind (the mother had probed A about it).[^181] She paints a rosy picture of the child having settled in very well in Amsterdam in the short time that the child was there.

150    Yet, the fact remains that this is a young child who was born and raised in Singapore and Amsterdam presents a completely new environment and culture to the child. Except for the mother, there is no one the child is familiar with in Amsterdam. The place is new, the school is new, the Mandarin tutor is new and even the nanny is new. So it would be hardly surprising for any child in those circumstances to miss home especially during the initial phase of adjustment.

151    A in fact often talks about Singapore and his other school and homes as was observed independently by his teacher in OOL school. A has to cope without one parent, though this is no doubt mitigated by the trips of the father to Amsterdam in January and March 2019 and the trip home with the mother in February 2019 to celebrate Chinese New Year. Despite that, the following testimonial provided by the nanny J to the mother reveals that A has difficult moments:[^182]

> A few weeks ago \[A\] was sick and could not go to school.

> I would come over all day to look after him and keep Mommy informed through the Whatsapp. This shows that he accepts me and he is also affectionate towards me and wanted hugs.

> I recognise \[A\] here in Amsterdam as a very cheerful guy, who loves to be in the Netherlands. He already has some nice friends and is doing very well in school.

> **Sometimes he has difficult moments, just like all the children who go to school for the first time. He understands that fathers and mothers need to work. Wherever they are.**

> \[Emphasis added\]

152    Again, this is hardly surprising. As noted in _BNS v BNT_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 187</span> (“_BNS (HC)_”) (at \[21\]), citing _BG v BF_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 3 SLR(R) 233</span>), “a child will feel more secure if both his parents continue to be involved in his life”. It was further noted in _BNS (HC)_ (at \[22\], citing _HKMB v LKL_ \[2007\] HKCU 291) that it was “important for the child’s “emotional and psychological stability” to maintain “regular and meaningful contacts” with both parents and that the child would experience a “sense of loss” if his relationship with the parent who is left behind was adversely affected”.

153    By putting all the blame on the child’s wish to go back to Singapore on the father, the mother may have inadvertently failed to appreciate the possibility that the child may be experiencing real distress arising from the drastic changes brought by the change in his living environment.

154    The mother next accuses the father of manipulating the evidence. The mother submits as follows:[^183]

> 66.    Further, the Mother had given evidence to show that the Father was once again blatantly dishonest about the calendar he had produced to this Court. He had only shown the Court the calendar from January to July 2019, without showing the rest of the calendar which had been marked all the way to December 2019.

> 67.    The Mother had shown to this Court that in reality, the Father had marked out all of \[A\]’s school holidays for the entire year of 2019. In particular, the Father had also marked out:

>> (a)    \[A\]’s school holiday for October 2019; and

>> (b)    \[A\]’s school holiday for December 2019 – including plans for \[A\] to visit both Singapore and Sydney during the December Christmas holidays.

> 68.    Clearly, the Father was deliberately selective and deliberately manipulative in respect of the evidence he presented to this Court. He consciously disclosed parts of the calendar that would support his case that Amsterdam was a “trial” for \[A\] but did not wish to disclose the calendar up to December 2019, which would demonstrate that the intention of the parties was for A to be based in Amsterdam throughout and for the family to arrange visits and holidays. The Father has misled this Honourable Court.

155    Yet, I note that in the mother’s detailed 353-page supporting affidavit, there was no mention of the marked calendar. When the marked calendar is produced by the father, the mother seeks to throw doubt on the credibility of the father by saying that he should have produced the full year of the calendar instead of just 7 months. As will be seen, the marked calendar is a critical piece of contemporaneous evidence that provides a valuable insight into the minds of the parties at the material time. It will also be seen that the parts left out by the father (in particular, the December calendar) actually strengthen the father’s case.

156    The mother says it is “shocking”[^184] that the father has given 3 different versions of events. First, it is the father’s case that he had objected to the said relocation.[^185] Then, the father changes his story to say that he agreed to a conditional relocation for a trial period of 3 months.[^186] Then the father presents a third version by claiming that the long-stop date for the trial period is July 2019.[^187] The mother submits as follows:[^188]

> It is submitted that the Father had presented 3 different versions of events to this Court, in the hope that the Court would accept one version as the truth. It is further submitted that there cannot be 3 versions of events and if one version is true, then the Father must be lying about the other 2 versions of events. The alternative is that all 3 versions are untrue. The Father’s dishonesty is evident.

157    I have, as seen earlier, set out in some detail the version of events as recounted by the mother and the father respectively. I did not find anything that is “shocking” in the story that each has told. Both have provided explanations in the narratives they have given. The narratives and explanations provide the full context as to how events unfolded. When these narratives and explanations are properly understood, I do not see how it can be said that the father has presented three versions of events.

158    Finally, the mother says that the father’s conduct of eventually abducting A to Singapore on 29 May 2019 shows the father’s capability in disregarding authority and doing anything in order to achieve his means.[^189] The mother says the father has no qualms lying to the police in Paris to make a false declaration that A’s passport is lost in order to obtain a temporary travel document for A to travel to Paris to Singapore on 29 May 2019. The mother suspects that the father might have also made a false declaration to the Immigration Checkpoint Authority (“ICA”) that A’s passport is lost or missing in order to obtain a replacement passport for A,[^190] and at the hearing on 6 August 2019 before me, invited this court to direct the father to produce a copy of the form he would have submitted to the ICA. The mother reiterates that the father has no qualms about doing all the above in order to achieve his aims.[^191]

159    On the other hand, it was the mother who had breached the agreement with the father to have A back in Singapore for the April 2019 holidays. The mother explains that she “had no choice but to decline to visit during the school holidays”[^192] as she was afraid that the father might not let them return to Amsterdam (see the mother’s email of 1 April 2019 at paragraph 7 above). The mother says,[^193]

> If \[Father\]’s case is that I had “wrongfully retained” \[A\] in Amsterdam from April 2019, which I categorically deny given the consensual relocation, then his recourse would have been to institute proceedings in Netherlands on the basis of my alleged wrongful retention and to seek an order for return. It would not be to take matters into his own hands and plot behind my aback to abduct \[A\] to Singapore without my knowledge or consent.

160    The mother says the father could have instituted proceedings instead of taking matters into his own hands. However, what is true for the father must also be true for the mother. In a similar vein, the mother could have kept to the agreement to have A back in Singapore and take out an application for relocation so that the issues can be properly ventilated and resolved. Instead, the mother made the unilateral decision to keep the child in Amsterdam without any indication as to whether the child would be coming back to Singapore at all, which only aggravated matters.

161    In summary, I do not find any of the accusations levelled at the father to be helpful at all in getting to the truth of the matter. In my view, they serve to obfuscate rather than clarify issues. If the father did commit any offence, he would no doubt have to face the consequences. Where this application is concerned, the crux of the matter is whether the parties had jointly intended for A to relocate to Amsterdam for 3 years as alleged by the mother.

162    I begin first with the marked calendar because the veracity of this piece of evidence is not disputed by either of the parties. Unlike the mother’s email dated 18 January 2019 to the immigration consultant on the possibility of A returning to Singapore before her (which the mother claims was sent under pressure from the father),[^194] the probative value of the marked calendar is unaffected by any allegation, qualification or explication.

163    In fact, the mother herself has, by her own evidence, admitted that “we had marked out the calendar dates for the entire year of 2019, in order to plan our trips and holidays for the entire year”. The relevant parts of her evidence in her 2nd Affidavit (at \[68\] to \[74\]) state:

> 68    Further, \[Father\] only showed the calendar from January to July 2019 – in order to support his case that Amsterdam was a trial for 3 months or 7 months (depending on which version he wishes to rely on).

> 69.    In reality, **we had marked out the calendar dates** for the entire year 2019, in order to plan our trips and holidays for the entire year. \[Father\] only showed the calendar for the first 7 months of the year in order to pain a misleading picture to the Court.

> 70.    For example, **we have marked out the dates** for the December holidays for 2019 for our travel as well. **The agreement** was that we will spend 1 week in Singapore and 1 week in Australia during the Christmas period. In fact, the handwriting on the bottom page of the December 2019 calendar states “assuming \[A\] cont school in \[OOL school\], he will be in SIN on 20th ->23rd, Syd: 24-31”.

> 71.     **We had also marked out** \[A\]’s school holidays for April and July 2019 so that we would be able to plan \[Father\]’s visits to Amsterdam or our visits to Singapore during the school holidays. There was never an agreement for a long-stop date in July 2019 as alleged by \[Father\].

> 72.    As for \[Father\]’s March 2019 visit, **the intention was for us** to discuss during that visit how \[A\] was settling in Amsterdam – if the mandarin tutor was appropriate, how he was doing at school and with \[J\] our nanny. This was merely to update \[Father\] given that \[A\] would have been in Amsterdam for about 2 months. It was not contemplated that we would only try Amsterdam for 2-3 months and then return to Singapore.

> 73.    I would also point out that these markings are \[Father\]’s handwriting which was done when we first flew to Amsterdam in January 2019 and \[Father\] joined us to help us settle into Amsterdam. At that time, I recall that we were still staying at the temporary apartment before we found the apartment which we are no residing at in Amsterdam.

> 74.    Exhibited hereto and marked as ‘SEM-1” at pages 62-73 is a complete set of images of the same calendar from January to December 2019.

> \[Emphasis added\]

164    It is clear from the above that by the mother’s own account (in particular, the parts in bold), the markings on the calendar reflect the shared intention of the parties. The mother, as can be seen from the above extracts, has attempted to give a subjective interpretation to the markings on the calendar. However, what do these markings reveal objectively?

165    Of particular significance is the entry in the month of March 2019 where the marking for the period 18 to 25 March 2019 states:

> _Discuss \[A\] school_

> _Worst case of \[A\] coming back_

166    The mother’s explanation says that this is for the father’s visit in March 2019 “to discuss during that visit how \[A\] was settling in Amsterdam – if the mandarin tutor was appropriate, how he was doing at school and with \[J\] our nanny”. However, the mother’s explanation does not comport with the clear wordings of the marking. In particular, the explanation provides no explanation for what the parties had intended by the words “_Worst case of \[A\] coming back_”.

167    The next material marking is found in the month of July 2019. It states:

> _Assuming \[A\] cont school in \[OOL school\], he will rtn latest by 1 July_

168    The mother explains that this is “to plan \[Father\]’s visits to Amsterdam or our visits to Singapore during the school holidays. There was never an agreement for a long-stop date in July 2019 as alleged by \[Father\].” Once again, the explanation does not comport with the entry. It fails to shed any light on the words “_Assuming \[A\] cont school in \[OOL school\]_” and “_he will rtn latest by 1 July_”.

169    Finally, there is yet another material marking in the month of December 2019 which states:

> _assuming \[A\] cont school in \[OOL school\], he will be in SIN on 20th ->23rd, Syd: 24-31_

170    The mother explains that this is to mark out “the dates for the December holidays for 2019 for our travel as well”. However, the explanation fails to account for the words “_assuming \[A\] cont school in \[OOL school\]_”.

171    Leaving aside the subjective explanations provided by the mother, the markings on the calendar show objectively that in the minds of the parties, it is contemplated that A may discontinue school in Amsterdam in the course of the year and return to Singapore. There is, in this regard, a noticeable consistency in the markings in March, July and December 2019.

172    This consistency is also discernible from a number of documentary evidence before the court:

> (a)     The mother’s email of 8 January 2019 to SCH school (see paragraph 113 above):

>> We have advised \[A\]’s teachers that A will not be returning to \[SCH school\] for now. **If we do come back to the school**, do we need to pay a registration fee again?

>> \[Emphasis added\]

> (b)     The father’s email of 9 January 2019 to the mother (see paragraph 114 above):

>> Hi, I have signed the letter with the understanding that this is to allow A to **try out the school**. We/I can chose to stop the school at any time with no reason required, and have \[A\] back to Singapore.

>> \[Emphasis added\]

> (c)     The mother’s email of 18 January 2019 to the immigration consultant (see paragraph 116 above):

>> Hi \[Z\],

>> Hope all is well! I left a message for you today, hoping you could answer a few questions.

>> Is there any penalty imposed **if my son were to return to Singapore earlier than me to live?**

>> **Would he have any issues coming in and out of the Netherlands to visit me if I were to remain here?**

>> \[Emphasis added\]

> (d)     The father’s text message on 18 March 2019 (at 7:54:08) am to the mother (see paragraph 70 above):

>> Looking back a few months, i was trying to be supportive husband, by supporting you to go for the job interview. When u got the job offer, i am not convinced tt it will work out better financially for us, thus decided not to move forward. I was very sad when you proceed to agreed to the offer without much discussion. It shocked and sadden me even more that you took the job, knowing how bad our r/s is. I rem all the sacrifices you made and everything i did was trying to be a good husband and trying to salvage our marriage. However, whatever i tried or did in the past months only made things worst. I even tried giving you space, but it just made us grew further part. Today my wife hated me so much tt she wldnt want to talk to me or touch me. I am like a plague. No words can describe the pain and no amount of tears makes it better. I am not sure how much longer i can handle tis.

>> You said you broke down in tears whenever sme1 asked how you were. I will like to hear from you and knw what I can do to make things better, but you don’t share with me.

>> Many decisions had been made against my wish, even though i shared explicitly my tots and decisions. \[A\] had said to me many times he wants to be back to sgp, and I will very much want to do so too. I am not sure if we get any chance to talk abt it as you will be going away, so I am sharing with you again now tt I will bring \[A\] back to sgp. **We made the agreement when we were still in sgp, tt we will decide in Mar if \[A\] will stay in \[OOL school\].** Both \[A\] and I will very much like you to be back to sgp with us together.

>> I have said many times, i am not sure what i can do to really salvage our r/s, if you can tell me how or what i can do. I will very much do it, as long as it is within my possible means and it does not stop \[A\] from coming back to sgp.

>> \[Emphasis added\]

> (e)     The mother’s email of 1 April 2019 to the father (see paragraph 7 above):

>> Hi \[father\],

>> I thought about it a long time but I think it is in the best interests of \[A\] that we won’t be coming to Singapore for the school holidays. You and your mum are of course welcome to come and spend time with him here during the holidays, I am not travelling to Boston.

>> \[A\] has just settled in well at school and has formed friendships and relationships with his teachers. He is happy. I’ve been thinking about him a great deal, I don’t want to confuse him and really do want what is best for him. **He has settled in well here and I do worry about going back to Singapore now for the holiday and the impact it would have on him not returning to Amsterdam.** We looked at schools, we made a decision to let him start school and I’d like for that to continue **for this moment**. I am also concerned that if we do come to Singapore, you will not let us return to Amsterdam, as you said.

>> It is clear that we have to talk about our future and taking care of \[A\] must be our top priority. **At the moment**, I feel that staying here in Amsterdam for the holidays is best for all of us.

>> I’m sorry.

>> \[mother\]

>> \[Emphasis added\]

173    The mother explains that her email of 8 January 2019 to SCH school was “simply seeking clarification with the school in respect of the costing and procedure in the event that \[A\] returns to Singapore and continued attending SCH school.” She says that there was “no specific date indicated in that email” and “international schools are expensive and I have always been the one paying for \[A\]’s school fees entirely”.[^195]

174    However, I do not find the explanation convincing. The mother’s posting to Amsterdam as per the signed expat contract is for 4 years. That is so far away in the future that it does not make sense for a question of this nature to be put to SCH school at this point in time, unless it is contemplated that A may return to SCH school well before the expiry of her contract.

175    In contrast to the above evidence, there is a marked absence of any documentary evidence that shows a shared intention for A to relocate to Amsterdam for 3 years. The mother has sought to explain that this is because she has refrained from replying substantively to the father to avoid getting into an argument with the father and that she is also afraid of him.[^196] Yet, there can be no doubt that the mother is capable of asserting herself and putting down her foot when push comes to shove. A clear example is when the father texted the mother on 16 March 2019 to tell her that A will start SCH school from July for 1.5 years to prepare him for primary school (see paragraph 70 above). The mother relied in no uncertain terms:

> **I’m not ok with that**. We need to talk about it rather than it be a decision on one side.

> \[Emphasis added\]

176    The assertiveness is also discernible from her affidavits in the way she discredited the father and reduced the role of the paternal grandmother and the helper K to a “a minimal role in caring for \[A\], if at all”.[^197] It is also evident in her unilateral decision to keep the child in Amsterdam.

177    The father had reminded the mother over email and text messages in January and March 2019 that the parties had agreed that A was only to try out OOL school but not once did the mother refute or clarified any of those allegations with the father. Whilst the mother says that she wanted to avoid getting into an argument with the father, her silence in the face of these serious allegations is also entirely consistent with the fact that the father was stating the truth. In light of the objective evidence provided by the marked calendar, the latter explanation would seem more likely to be the case.

178    The main substantive piece of documentary evidence relied upon by the mother is the permission letter signed by the father on 21 November 2018 and even this does not state that the father had agreed to A’s relocation to Amsterdam for 3 years. Moreover, the question as to when and why the mother had taken a photograph of the permission letter instead of taking the original signed copy from the father remains unexplained despite her explanation in her 2nd Affidavit.[^198]

179    It is also worthwhile to take a step back and ask a broader question - is it plausible at all for the parties to have agreed for A to relocate to Amsterdam for 3 months on a trial basis? In her 2nd Affidavit (at \[52\]-\[55\]), the mother states:

> 52    His allegation that he agreed to the relocation on a trial basis because our marriage was on the line is a **ridiculous and a preposterous rationale.** If indeed our marriage was on the line, the last thing he would be to agree to \[A\] and I moving to a different country. He would have insisted that we stayed on in Singapore and continue with our marriage counselling. \[Father\] is again simply trying to find excuses to explain away his rationale for agreeing to the relocation when in reality, he did provide his consent and his reasons for doing so is irrelevant.

> 53    It would also defy logic that we would agree to \[A\] relocating to Amsterdam for only 3 months on a trial basis and for him to return in April 2019. This would mean uprooting him necessarily from his life and routines in Singapore, only to have him establish a new life and routine in Amsterdam for 3 months and then return to Singapore to restart everything all over again. This is not only an illogical decision but one that was disruptive to \[A\]’s life and against the welfare and interests of \[A\]. \[A\] is at an age when he thrives on routine and stability and I would never have planned a relocation for him if it was only for a 3-month period.

> 54.    I refer to paragraph 70 to 70 of \[Father\]’s affidavit.

> 55.    Again, Father is trying to re-write history by putting a different spin on the actual events that took place to our relocation…

> \[Emphasis added\]

180    The mother says that it is “ridiculous” and “preposterous” that the father would agree to a relocation on a trial basis because the marriage was on the line. However, some lessons can be drawn from _TUC v TUD_ where the court noted (at \[40\]) as follows:

> The present case is potentially one of wrongful retention rather than wrongful removal. The children were not wrongfully removed from the USA since both parties agreed that they should be brought from the USA to Singapore for a family holiday. **The Father’s case** is not that he did not agree at all to the children leaving the USA for Singapore. Rather, as his counsel, Mr Yap Teong Liang, explained, his case **is that his agreement to the children’s stay in Singapore was for a limited period of time and**, as Mr Yap developed his arguments in the course of this appeal, **for the limited purpose of saving the marriage and keeping the family together**, a purpose which expired when the Mother indicated her intention to divorce him on 2 June 2016; accordingly, the children were wrongfully retained on that date.

> \[Emphasis\]

181    In _TUC v TUD_, the husband had similarly agreed to a relocation of the children for a limited period for the purpose of saving the marriage. So a factual matrix of such nature is not unusual. There is nothing ridiculous or preposterous for a spouse to make sacrifices for the sake of the marriage and the family.

182    In the present case, the father is clearly very concerned about losing the child as is evident by the fact that he had asked the mother for the signed permission letter to be returned back to him that very same night. He had initially objected to the relocation but because the marriage was so strained, he gave in to the mother. The fact that he has agreed for the child to go on a trial basis is not at all implausible. Understandably, it was an attempt on his part to accommodate the mother despite all his concerns.

183    Certainly, it may well be the mother’s intention for A to relocate with her to Amsterdam for 3 years or more. However, there is no evidence to show that this was ever communicated to the father apart from the mother’s bare assertion. The permission letter, which the mother drafted, did not even set this out. In contrast, there are several pieces of documentary evidence (in particular, the marked calendar) which corroborate the father’s account that A was to relocate to Amsterdam on a “trial basis” only.

184    As noted in _TUC v TUD_ (at \[61\]-\[62\]):

> **We prefer the view that the unilateral intent or purpose of one of the parents** **_cannot_** **be a factor to be considered in determining the habitual residence of a child.** Our principal reason for taking this view is that where the parents are at odds on the issue and there is no shared intention, the intention of the one parent that _could_ be relevant to a _change_ of the child’s habitual residence will be the intention of the abducting parent. To accord weight to this as a relevant consideration seems to us to be contrary to the purpose of the Hague Convention and, indeed, to good sense. In the words of the New Zealand Court of Appeal in _SK v KP_, to hold that the unilateral purpose of one of the parents can change a child’s habitual residence “would not accord with the \[Hague Convention\] and would provide an encouragement to abduction and retention” (at \[76\] _per_ Glazebrook J). The purpose of the Hague Convention is to prevent parents from acting unilaterally and engaging in, as it were, self-help remedies.

> This consideration becomes particularly significant **where, as in this case, one parent has agreed to a relocation of the children in the context of attempting a reconciliation with the other. That parent may have consented to a temporary relocation in an effort to be constructive by taking a less adversarial and more conciliatory approach. The abducting parent, on the other hand, may by then have formed a settled intention to relocate permanently with the children. In such a situation, it would be especially unsatisfactory, in our judgment, if the court were to ascribe any weight to the abducting parent’s unilateral intention in determining whether the children’s habitual residence has changed.**

> \[Emphasis added\]

185    It is clear from the above that the unilateral intention of the mother is irrelevant in determining whether A’s habitual residence has changed.

186    In summary, the evidence does not support the mother’s claim that there was a shared intention to relocate the child to Amsterdam for a period of 3 years. Whatever the mother’s intention might have been, I find that the father had only agreed for the child to relocate to Amsterdam on a trial basis. The marked calendar shows clearly that the parties were to review the arrangement in March 2019 which they did and the father had indicated unequivocally his decision to the mother for the child to return to Singapore. There was as such no shared intention to change the habitual residence of the child to the Netherlands.

**_The objective circumstances_**

187    In _TUC v TUD_, the court observed as follows (at \[55\]-\[56\]):

> Here again, we agree with the views of Ong JC in _TDX v TDY_, where she noted (at \[44\]–\[45\]) that:

>> (a)    Where older children are concerned, the inquiry into habitual residence should include objective factors such as the length of their stay in the new country, their living conditions there and whether they had attended school or worked there, as well as subjective factors such as their reasons for and perceptions of being in the new country.

>> (b)    In contrast, **where the child is very young, the objective factors and the parents’ intentions and place of residence take on greater significance**; much less, if any, weight is placed on the subjective factors (specifically, the child’s perceptions and intentions).

> 56    Indeed, in the case of very young children, there are unlikely to be any “subjective” factors to speak of. Such children are likely to have relocated entirely because of their parents’ decisions; it is therefore the intentions of the parents in relocating the children which will be significant in determining whether the children’s habitual residence has changed.

188    It is clear from the above that where the child is very young, the objective factors and the parents’ intentions take on greater significance in determining the child’s habitual residence.

189    The testimonial from the nanny J shows that A has difficult moments. The mother acknowledges A’s difficult moments but says that they are due to A’s separation anxiety and have nothing to do with adjustment issues:[^199]

> \[J\]’s comment about \[A\] having difficult moments is with reference to his separation anxiety when he has to attend school or is separated from his parents. This is common at his age and also when we were living in Singapore. It has nothing to do with any adjustment issues in Amsterdam, for which there are none. In fact, I have shown that \[A\] has separation anxiety in Singapore during my visits with him in the past 1.5 months. He would throw tantrums on many occasions when I have to leave after each visit and would ask me to stay on.

190    However, it is important to remember that the challenges a young child may face when put into a new environment are very real. This is because a young child usually takes a longer time to settle in a new environment than older children. As observed by Debbie Ong JC (as she then was) in _TDX v TDY_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHCF 4</span> (at \[48\]):

> As B is a very young child, she would not have been as settled in a community the way an older child who has been living and schooling in a community for more years might have.

191    If A has separation anxiety as stated by the mother, there is all the more reason to believe that it would be so much more challenging for A to adjust to a new environment.

192    Further, as noted earlier, a child will feel more secure if both his parents continue to be involved in his life. In the present case, A has to cope with living in a new environment without the presence of the father, as well as the paternal grandmother and the helper K, at a time when their presence is most needed to comfort him. Therefore, one simply cannot discount the possibility that A may be experiencing a sense of loss which may have contributed to the difficulty he is facing.

193    In fact, the mother has alluded to an appointment to meet A’s school child psychologist as she was concerned that A “started to display unusual behaviour since \[Father\] arrived in Amsterdam on 17 May 2019”.[^200] Although the mother appears to blame A’s unusual behaviour on the father, I do not think it is safe at all to draw any conclusion from these bare allegations.

194    In my judgment, the objective factors do not support a finding that A has settled and integrated fully into the community in Amsterdam. This is understandable given that A is of such tender age and was only in Amsterdam for a brief period of time. As such, the habitual residence of A had not changed to the Netherlands.

195    Finally, the following observations of the court in _TUC v TUD_ (at \[127\]) bear reiterating:

> As we mentioned earlier (at \[62\] above), a court should be slow to conclude that the habitual residence of a child has changed in circumstances where one parent acquiesces to a move to another country as part of an effort to attempt a reconciliation with the other parent and where only a short period of time has passed in the new country. The position in this case might well have been different if the parties had gone on to stay in Singapore for a sufficiently long period of time because then, at some stage, the children would have become so settled in Singapore that their habitual residence would have changed regardless of what their parents’ intentions were when they first came here. On the facts before us, however, we are satisfied, **given the brief duration of the children’s stay in Singapore coupled with the absence of any joint parental intention to move here for a definite period of time, that the habitual residence of the children remained the USA and had not changed to Singapore by 2 June 2016.**

> \[Emphasis added\]

196    A similar conclusion can be drawn in the present case. The brief duration of A’s stay in Amsterdam and the absence of any shared parental intention to change the habitual residence of A would also support the finding that A’s habitual residence remained in Singapore and had not changed to the Netherlands.

### No change in habitual residence

197    For the reasons set out above, I find that A’s habitual residence remained in Singapore and had not changed to the Netherlands at the material time. In the circumstances, the first requirement under s 8(1) of the ICAA has not been made out.

198    I now turn to the second requirement of s 8(1). This involves a consideration of whether the removal of A by the father constituted wrongful removal under the law of the Netherlands.

## Wrongful Removal

199    As noted earlier, Article 3 of the Convention stipulates that the removal of a child is to be considered wrongful where it is in breach of the rights of custody attributed to a person under the law of the State in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal.

200    Since the mother’s application is premised on the habitual residence of the child being in the Netherlands, I sought clarifications from the parties at the outset of the hearing whether there is any dispute that the removal of the child was in breach of rights of custody attributed to the mother under the law of the Netherlands. This is because I note from my perusal of the supporting and reply affidavits of the mother that she did not produce any evidence on the law of the Netherlands relevant to this application. All that was set out in her 1st Affidavit (at \[150\]) was as follows:

> I was of course thankful that \[A\] is safe and sound and that nothing untoward had happened to him. However, I was extremely distraught that \[A\] was taken away from me in this manner without my knowledge and consent. Not only was \[Father\] dishonest, his conduct in wrongfully removing \[A\] from Amsterdam without my permission is unlawful under Dutch law and I believe constituted international child abduction under the Convention.

201    The mother, if I understood counsel correctly, took the position that the onus is on the father to take up the issue as a defence. Since the issue of wrongful removal was never raised by the father, there is no requirement for the mother to produce evidence of the law of the Netherlands. The mother suggests that the father is making an issue out of this only because of the clarifications sought by the court. The father’s position is that there is an evidential gap in the mother’s case.

202    In my view, it is important to draw a distinction between the requirements of s 8(1) that an applicant will need to satisfy to obtain a return order and the defences that may be raised by a defendant as provided for in the limited exceptions under the Convention. The burden of proof is on the applicant in the former and the defendant in the latter.

203    Article 14 of the Convention states:

> In ascertaining whether there has been a wrongful removal or retention within the meaning of Article 3, the judicial or administrative authorities of the requested State may take notice directly of the law of, and of judicial or administrative decisions, formally recognised or not in the State of the habitual residence of the child, without recourse to the specific procedures for the proof of that law or for the recognition of foreign decision which would otherwise be applicable.

204    In the present case, no material has been produced by the mother to enable the court to consider whether the removal of A constituted wrongful removal under the law of the Netherlands. It must be noted that the mother had breached the agreement with the father when she decided unilaterally that she would not take the child back to Singapore and this led to the father removing the child from Amsterdam without the consent of the mother. It cannot be assumed that the removal of the child under these circumstances necessarily constituted wrongful removal under the law of the Netherlands or for that matter, under the law of any other Contracting State.

205    Pursuant to the judge-led power under Rule 22 of the Family Justice Rules, I would have been minded to direct the mother to provide evidence of the law of the Netherlands in relation to the current proceedings so that the mother’s application may be fully considered based on its substantive merits, and not defeated solely on technical ground. However, having reviewed all the evidence, I find that it would serve no purpose to do so as it has not been shown that A’s habitual residence had changed to the Netherlands.

## Conclusion

206    For the above reasons, the application is dismissed.

207    I would encourage parties to agree on the issue of costs. If there is no agreement, they are to file and exchange submissions on the issue of costs within 2 weeks from the date of this judgment.
