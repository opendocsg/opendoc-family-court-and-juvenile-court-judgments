Variation In Care And Control

30 November 2020

### District Judge Toh Wee San:

1       There was an appeal from the Defendant Husband (“Husband”) against my decision to vary the consent order between parties from sole care over the child to joint care over the child. There was no appeal against my decision for parties to maintain the child jointly. I provide my reasons below.

## Background

2       The parties were married on 12 January 2015. There is one child, a girl, to the marriage. The child is currently 5 years old. The Plaintiff Wife (“Wife”) is 27 years old and works as a singer in a nightclub (para 20 of PA1[^1]). She leaves for work at about 10pm to 10:30pm and return home around 2:30am to 3am (para 11 of PA3[^2]). She is currently cohabitating with her partner and her partner’s mother. The Husband is 34 years old and works as a pub owner (para 12 of DA1[^3]). He leaves for work after 8:30pm when the child goes to bed (para 12 of DA1).

3       In December 2015 parties separated and the Wife left the matrimonial home. The child resided with the Husband together with the paternal grandmother. In 2016, the Husband filed an application under section 5 of the Guardianship of Infants Act (Cap. 122) for care and control of the child. Parties entered into a consent order for joint custody of the child, with sole care and control to the Father. The Wife had reasonable access to the child once a week.

4       In 2018, parties divorced without contest based on the Father’s unreasonable behavior and they entered into a consent order for joint custody of the child, with sole care and control with the Father and reasonable access for the Mother. In particular, the Wife has access every Tuesday from 9am to 7pm, and access to the child on the second day of Chinese New Year and the day after the child’s birthday. The consent order also provided that the Husband will solely maintain the child.

5       In April 2020, the Wife filed a summons to vary the consent order dated 2018. Specifically, the Wife prayed to have sole or shared care and control of the child. Alternatively, the Wife prayed for increased access to the child including weekends, overnight and overseas access. The Wife also sought to vary the maintenance order such that both parties were to jointly maintain the child.

6       The Husband objected to the Mother’s application and the matter was placed before me for hearing. After hearing parties, I was persuaded that parties should have joint custody and care over the child, with Husband to be the final decision maker if there was a deadlock. A copy of my order is annexed. I elaborate on my reasons below.

## Parties’ cases in brief

### Mother’s case

7       The Mother’s reasons for sole or joint care of the care were:

> (a)     First, she wanted to be more involved with the child and submitted that she can more devote time to care for the child. The Wife submitted that her current job offered her with the flexibility to plan her schedule and to allocate time to look after the child (para 24 of PWS[^4]). The Wife also mentioned that she is in a stable relationship with her partner and they intend to get married soon (para 50 to 52 of PA1).

> (b)     The Wife argued that the Husband was also busy with his pub business and relied on his family to care for the child. (para 22 and 23 of PWS).

> (c)     The Wife highlighted that it would be in the child’s best interest to be placed under the care of her own parent rather than a grandparent especially given the child’s young age (para 24 of PWS). The Wife also stated that her partner’s mother has agreed to assist in looking after the child at night when the Wife is at work or during the day when the Wife is still sleeping (para 55 of PA1, para 12 of PA3). In the Mother’s supplementary affidavit, she stated that she has employed a foreign domestic worker to help look after the child (para 8 of PA3).

> (d)     Second, the Wife took the position that the Husband had not been co-parenting effectively. The Wife referred to incidents where the Husband refused to allow her access to the child and had even threatened to call the police (para 17 of PWS). The Wife had also cited an instance where the Husband did not consult with her and had enrolled the child in a school of his choice (para 18 of PWS). The Wife further argued that the Husband refused to register her name with the school and she was therefore unable to pick up the child from school.

> (e)     In addition, the Wife stated that the Husband and his mother had spoken ill of her and her partner to the child causing the child to behave in a fearful manner at times when the Wife fetches her for access (para 20 to 21 of PWS).

> (f)     Lastly, the Wife argued that the child is often reluctant to return home to the Husband after her access (para 25 of PWS). The Wife urged me to consider the child’s young age and the fact that the child should have her Mother’s guidance on her road to puberty (para 29 of PWS).

8       The Wife submitted that she is willing to grant the Husband with reasonable access to the child as she acknowledges the need for the child to have both parents by her side (para 30 of PWS).

9       In the event that I was not minded to reverse care and control or make an order for shared care and control of the child, the Wife urged me to vary the access arrangements such as to allow her greater access to the child, including weekend access, overnight access and overseas access (para 38 of PWS).

10     The Wife further highlighted that the child has since started school and her access time has been reduced from 10 hours a week previously to 7 hours per week (para 42 of PWS). She further submitted that she should be given school holiday access since the child has started to go to school (para 46 of PWS) and her current living arrangements whereby she resides with her partner and the partner’s mother enables her to accommodate the child for overnight access (para 45 of PWS).

### Father’s case

11     The Husband objected to the Mother’s application for reversal of care and control or shared care and control of the child for several reasons: -

> (a)     The Husband was doubtful of the Mother’s current relationship with her partner and highlighted that the Wife had changed several romantic partners during their marriage and after the divorce (para 16 of DWS[^5]). On this premise, the Husband argued that the Mother’s conduct was immoral and would not be a good environment for the child (para 18 of DWS). This was contested by the Wife who countered that she only had two relationships and the second one was the current permanent relationship she was in.

> (b)     The Husband raised concerns about the child’s modesty when she is with the Mother’s partner (para 16 and 17 of DA1, para 11 of DA2).

> (c)     The Husband argued that the Wife did not have a stable support system in place especially since she was not legally married to her partner at the time of the application. As such, the Husband highlighted the possibility of the Wife being forced out of her partner’s residence should their relationship end (para 19 of DWS).

> (d)     The Husband submitted that the Wife is not a good caregiver for the child and cited the “driving incident” where the Wife allowed the child to sit on her partner’s lap while her partner was driving even though this is prohibited under traffic regulations (para 21 of DWS). The Husband also highlighted that the Wife fed the child with unhealthy meals during access time (para 22 of DWS).

> (e)     The Husband argued that status quo should be maintained and he should continue to have sole care of the child to ensure stability in the child’s life. He referred to the example where his mother always prepared nutritious meals for the child but the Wife would not be able to do so given that she only woke up at noon and would have to resort to takeaways to feed the child (para 23 of DWS).

12     The Husband reiterated that the Wife lacked a proper care plan for the child. The Husband argued that the Wife only woke up at noon and would have to rely on her partner or her partner’s mother to look after the child (para 29 of DWS). The Husband also highlighted that even if the Wife engaged a domestic helper, she would still be delegating the responsibility of caretaking to outsiders (para 3 of DWS). In contrast, the Husband argued that he was able to provide a stable environment for the child where his parents had been helping to look after the child if he was at work (para 32 of DWS).

13     In view of the Wife’s working schedule and the lack of a caregiver for the child that the Husband can trust, the Husband was also not agreeable to allow the Wife overnight access with the child (para 33 of DWS).

14     In the event that an order for shared care and control was made, the Husband proposed for there to be an incremental increase rather than for the child to be uprooted from his household (para 11 of DA2).

## Decision and reasons

15     I applied the law[^6] and accepted the Wife’s argument that there was a material change in circumstance in two ways. First the Wife’s circumstance had changed. She is now in a stable relationship with plans to marry her male partner. More-ever she had engaged a helper to help her with the care of the child. In addition, her partner and partner’s mother expressed willingness to help her to care for the child. The Wife was presently gainfully employed and therefore financially, physically and emotionally able to care for the child. Second, there was also a change in the child’s circumstances. The child has grown up and was now a preschooler. Being a female child, it was understandable that the child craved much time, affection from and bonding with her mother.

16     It was clear to me that both parties loved their child very much and only wanted the best for her. Applying the law[^7], I opine that it will be in the best interest of the child for both her parents to care for her. As both parents worked, it was natural that they would require help from others like their close ones and/or domestic helper to care for the child when they were at work. I was also satisfied that both parents could communicate and co-parent when they treat each other cordially and focus on the common objective which was the child’s happiness and best interest. I granted the wife’s application to have more opportunity to care for the child and for both to have shared care over the child.

17     I was not persuaded by the Husband’s objections based on:

> (a)     Continuity of arrangement / stability for the child – Shared care does not affect the continuity or stability of the child.

> (b)     Wife’s profile and relationship status – Parties were in dispute over the Wife’s past. However, what was more important was the present. Presently, the Wife was in a steady relationship with her partner and they have plans to marry in the future once her partner is divorced.

> (c)     Wife’s caregiving ability – Before the application, the Wife had limited time with her child. Hence, she admitted to being more indulgent with the child. She informed that once she has more time, she will naturally be stricter with the child’s diet and activities. Re the “driving incident”, it was not ideal but more of an one-off incident. On balance, I find that the Wife should still have a chance to care for her child more.

> (d)     Wife’s change in her childminding plans – The Wife had modified her plans along the way. I found that there were nothing adverse as parties had been embroiled in this disagreement for some time. The Wife herself admitted that she started with just wanting overnight access but found that she wanted to have shared or sole care and control over the child when she filed her present application.

> (e)     Non-related parties caring for the child – Both parties were working parents. Naturally, they would require support and assistance to care for the child in their absence. The Husband’s objection was that the Wife’s helpers were not her relatives while his were. There was a lack of evidence to show that the Mother’s helpers were not suitable. It was common for a working parent to rely on a foreign domestic helper. In addition, the Wife’s steady partner and the partner’s mother can be seen to be akin to her family. The Wife has also stated that she plans to marry her partner in due course. Regarding the Husband’s objections to the Wife’s partner to bath, dress and sleep in the same room as the child, I agree that these should be avoided and the relevant restrictions were included in my court order.

18     I accepted the Husband’s request that shared care can be implemented incrementally for better transition by both sides and the child. While preparing to transit to shared care, we must not forget the Husband and his family’s painstaking efforts to care for and facilitate the access to the child in the past. It was understandable that the Husband will feel some loss and may need some time to accept this change. Nevertheless, I urge the parties to put their differences behind and place the child’s happiness and interest above all.

19     In view of the above, I decline to order costs against either side. I also directed parties, the child and their relevant helpers to attend counselling and will monitor their progress.
