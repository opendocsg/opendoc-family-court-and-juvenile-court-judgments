Family Law – Interim Access – Interim Maintenance

31 October 2019

### District Judge Lo Wai Ping:

## Introduction

1       The plaintiff (“Mother”) and the defendant (“Father”) were married in 2006 and they have two children, a daughter and a son (the “Children”) who are presently 13 years old and 8 years old respectively. On 5 March 2019, the parties obtained interim judgment for divorce (“IJ”) on their claims of unreasonable behaviour against each other.

2       Following the IJ, I heard the Father’s application in SUM 3365/2018 (“SUM 3365”) in the divorce suit. He was seeking interim orders for joint custody and shared care and control of the Children (amongst other things). I also heard the Mother’s application in SUM 3222/2018 (“SUM 3222”) for interim maintenance. These are my grounds of decision for the orders I had made on 28 June 2019 giving the Father interim access to the Children and dismissing the Mother’s application for interim maintenance. I will deal with the interim access orders first.

## Background

#### OSG 225 /2017 - Consent Order dated 1 February 2018

3       Prior to the commencement of the divorce suit, there were separate proceedings between the parties in OSG 225/2017 (“OSG 225”) in relation to the custody, care and control of the Children. A consent order dated 1 February 2018 (“Consent Order”) was recorded in these proceedings on the terms that the parties were to have joint custody and the Mother was to have care and control of the Children.

4       On the issue of access, the Consent Order stated that the Father was to have interim access to the Children every week pending divorce proceedings with effect from 6 February 2018 and the terms of the Father’s interim access were as follows:

> (a)     He was to have access to the Children _twice a week_ as follows:

>> (i)       Once on a weekday (“Weekday Access”)

>>> For this access, the Children were to go to the Father’s residence after school until 8.30pm every Tuesday. For the Son, the Father was to pick up the Son from his school. For the Daughter, she would be dropped off at 4.30pm at the Father’s residence by the Mother.

> (ii)     Once during the weekend (“Saturday Access”)

>> For this access on Saturday, the Father was to do the following:

>>> \-       pick up the Son at 1.15pm from Venue XX,

>>> \-       pick up the Daughter at 4.30pm from Venue YY,

>>> \-       bring the Son for his tennis class at 5pm and pick him up when it ends at 6.30pm,

>>> \-       bring the Children for dinner at 7pm and return them to the Mother’s residence by 9pm.

> (b)     He was also to have FaceTime access to the Children once on a weekday (Thursday) for half an hour (9pm to 9.30pm) (“FaceTime Access”).

5       However, about 3 months later, in May 2018, despite the Father’s objections, the Mother cancelled his Weekday Access and his FaceTime Access with the Children. The Mother’s position was that the Father was only entitled to his weekend access on Saturday.[^1] Shortly thereafter, in July 2018, the Mother commenced divorce proceedings against the Father. The Father contested the divorce and filed SUM 3365 in September 2018. The Mother’s SUM 3222 was also filed in September 2018. Thereafter, the parties proceeded for mediation. Eventually, in January 2019, parties agreed to proceed with the divorce on an uncontested basis and IJ was granted on 5 March 2019.

## SUM 3365 - Interim Access Orders

6       I heard SUM 3365 on 28 June 2019 after parties had obtained IJ. At the time of the hearing, the Children were living with the Mother (in her rented unit) whilst the Father was living alone in the matrimonial home (“Home”). The parties agreed to have joint custody of the Children and argued on the issues of care and control and access. The Father was acting in person whilst the Mother had counsel.

7       The Mother did not deny that she had refused the Father of all his Weekday and FaceTime Access to the Children since May 2018. Her main argument then was that these changes were necessary and justified because of the changes in the Son’s schooling schedule and extra-curricular activities with his move from kindergarten to his new school (“J School”) in April 2018.

8       The Father did not agree with the Mother’s actions and regarded her unilateral restrictions of his access rights under the Consent Order as breaches of the said order. In his view, the Mother was abusing her ‘care and control’ powers by reducing the frequency of his access to the Children and she was doing this intentionally to alienate the Children from him. The Father stated that before the Mother left the Home with the Children, he was a hands-on father and he wanted to be able to continue playing his role in actively engaging the Children and caring for them.

9       In SUM 3365, the Father prayed for interim shared care and control of the Children with the Mother. Specifically, he wanted the Children to stay with him during weekends (overnight from Saturday afternoon to Sunday afternoon) and he wanted to spend time with each child during the weekday (once a week). He wanted the Children with him for half of the school holidays and public holidays, with leave to take the children overseas during his half of the holidays. He also wanted to have make-up access on Sundays for all the access time he had been denied by the Mother since May 2018.

10     The Mother argued that she should continue to have care and control of them, with the Father having access to them only on Saturdays (to reflect the Children’s current schooling schedules and available timeslots for access). She denied that there was any intention on her part to alienate the Children from the Father. She had only their safety and well-being in mind and the Father had not demonstrated himself capable of caring for them properly.

11     After hearing the parties and considering the evidence filed before me including the 2 reports (the Supervised Access Summary Report in September 2018 and the Specific Issues Report in May 2019), I ordered that it was in the welfare of the Children that the Mother was to continue to have interim care and control of the Children pending the ancillary matters (“AMs”). It was noted that the AMs were very likely to be heard before the end of this year (2019) as the parties had by May 2019 already filed their affidavits of assets and means.

12     On the issue of interim access pending the AMs, I made orders that essentially gave the Father more contact time with the Children each week, on a regular basis. I did not grant the Father any overnight access. In brief, I ordered that, in addition to his existing Saturday Access, the Father was to have the following:

> (a)     One (1) weekday access (Tuesday) with the Son (from after school which ends at 3.40pm to latest, 9.15pm and in between the Father was to fetch the Son to and from his soccer class at 5-6.30pm);

> (b)     One (1) weekday access (Wednesday) with the Daughter (from after school (art club) which ends at 4.15pm to latest, 9.15pm);

> (c)     half of all public holidays, on an alternate basis (from 9.30am to 8.30pm);

> (d)     half a day for special occasions such as each child’s birthday, subject to school timings (if applicable), and

> (e)     FaceTime access with the Son on one weekday (between 6pm to 6.30pm or such other timing as may be agreed between the parties). There was no order on this for the Daughter as the Father was able to contact her directly on her mobile.

13     Whilst I did not grant the Father’s prayer that he be given access to compensate for all the access he had earlier been denied by the Mother since May 2018 (under the terms of the Consent Order), I did allow for the provision of make – up access moving forward. I ordered that the Father was to be provided make – up access if he should miss any of his access sessions (from the effective date of my orders on access) and for this make-up access, parties were to arrange for the equivalent make-up in terms of time missed with the Children, on a Sunday or any other day as may be agreed between the parties.

14     Concurrent with my orders on access (which were to be effective from 1 July 2019), I also made orders that the parents and the Children were to go for counselling at the Divorce Support Specialist Agencies (“DSSA”).

15     The Mother has appealed only against my (additional) access orders set out in paragraphs 12(a) to 12(d) and paragraph 13 and these are my reasons for these orders.

## Reasons for the Interim Access Orders

16     I begin with the incident that had led to the Mother leaving the Home with the Children on 18 October 2017. In brief, it was an incident between the parties in their bedroom at Home in the early hours of about 2.00am on 18 October 2017 (“the Incident”) when the Father tried to have intimate relations with the Mother. I noted that the Children were not involved in the Incident and when the Mother left the Home at about 5.00am with the Children, the Father was asleep. About 9 days later, Mother applied for a personal protection order (“PPO”) against the Father for herself as well as for the Children, alleging that the Father had committed family violence against them. The Father contested the PPO applications.

17     There was a full hearing of the PPO applications and this concluded in May 2019 and before the hearing of SUM 3365 on 28 June 2019. The PPO applications in respect of the Children were dismissed and there were no appeals against the dismissals.

18     Next, I considered the proceedings in OSG 225 which had led to the Consent Order of 1 February 2018.

19     The Mother filed OSG 225 on 1 December 2017 seeking sole care and control of the Children and supervised access for the Father. This was whilst the PPO proceedings were pending against the Father. On 7 December 2017, the Father filed an urgent application (SUM 4246/2017) for interim supervised access to the Children (amongst other things). According to the Father, he had done this in the interest of seeing the Children sooner rather than later (even though his position was that supervision was unnecessary) as by then (7 December 2017), he had not seen or spoken to the Children for 50 days due to the Mother’s refusal to grant access. In SUM 4246/2017, the Father had prayed for interim supervised access to the Children at the Family Service Centre (or that a private specialist be engaged to supervise access if the Family Service Centre was not able to accommodate the Children’s available timings for access).

20     In the end, the Mother agreed to the arrangements made for a private specialist (“Dr X”) to supervise the access and the Father was finally able to see his Children. He had a total of 13 supervised access sessions with the Children over about 7 weeks between 9 December 2017 and 30 January 2018. At this time, the Son was 6 years old and attending kindergarten and the Daughter was 12 years old and attending an international school.

21     It is pertinent to note that in her Supervised Contact Summary Report (“the Initial Report”) rendered in September 2018, Dr X had stated the following:

> (a)     that the Father was a hands-on parent who planned engaging activities that the Children enjoyed and that _there was genuine love and happiness when they were together_; and

> (b)     that he took active interest in the Children’s school work and extra- curricular activities and that _they definitely looked forward to their time with him_.

22     I also noted the following observations as stated in the Initial Report. At the first session on 9 December 2019 (this was after the Children had not seen the Father for about 50 days), it was observed that the Son hugged the Father the moment he saw him and frequently sought physical contact with him. When it was time to leave, the Son held on to his father’s leg and had to be dragged away. The Son could be heard crying loudly for a very long time. The Daughter too was observed to have warmly hugged her father. For the second session on 16 December 2017, it was observed that the Son ran to hug his father at the start and again at the end, the Son found it very difficult to say goodbye to his father and had to be dragged away crying loudly. Then the following sessions from 27 December 2017 to 20 January 2018 were reported to have become normalized. In summary, for these subsequent sessions, it was observed that the Son would wait excitedly for his father’s arrival if he had arrived earlier than his father and he became more composed at saying goodbyes. And, it was further observed that what the Son seemed to enjoy most was being picked up and held tightly by his father. As for the Daughter, she was at ease with her father and participated in the fun and laughter they had at the sessions. During some sessions, it was observed that her father had also helped her with her homework.

23     It was evident to me from a reading of the Initial Report that there was, at the time, a loving relationship between the Father and the Children and that it was in the Children’s welfare that the Father continued to have frequent and regular access to them, to maintain that loving relationship between them (notwithstanding the parties’ separation and marital tensions then).

24     And, importantly, on 1 February 2018, the parties agreed that whilst the Children remained under the care and control of the Mother, the Father would have (pending divorce proceedings) regular access to the Children vide his Weekday Access, Saturday Access and Face Time Access and this was set out in the Consent Order.

25     I then examined the Mother’s reasons for refusing the Father his Weekday Access and FaceTime Access since 14 May 2018. As I understood it, her main reason was the change in the Son’s schooling and activities schedule with his move from kindergarten to his J School.

26     Reading the correspondence that had been exchanged between the parties as well as their respective counsel over this matter at the material time (from April to June 2018), I did not agree that what the Mother had done in unilaterally terminating the Father’s Weekday Access and FaceTime Access was reasonable or acceptable.

27     Whilst there were certain changes to the Son’s schooling and activities schedule with his move to J School, it was nonetheless still feasible for the Mother (as the care parent) to have worked out a revised schedule that would allow the Father his agreed access to the Son and the Daughter on a weekday (albeit with some timing changes).

28     First, the change to the Son’s schooling schedule (which now ended about 3.40pm daily) did not actually affect the Father’s weekday access to the Daughter which was from 4.30pm to 8.30pm every Tuesday. Further, it was also the Mother’s obligation to drop the Daughter off at the Father’s Home every Tuesday at 4.30pm under the Consent Order. As such, these arrangements and access to the Daughter could have continued.

29     However, it was the Mother who wanted to have both the access to the Son and Daughter moved to a single weekday on Wednesday and on her proposed new terms which were these: that effective from 16 May 2018, the Father was to pick both Children up from her residence at 5.00pm every Wednesday, but in the event that the Daughter was to attend art class, then the Father was to pick the Son up from her residence at 4.50pm before picking the Daughter up from another venue at 5.05pm, and thereafter, he was to provide them dinner and bring them back to her residence at 8.30pm.[^2]

30     But, when the Father objected to her new terms and confronted her with the points in paragraph 28 above, the Mother then argued that the Children were not comfortable being split up for individual access sessions with him and that they had never gone for individual access with him.[^3] However, this was contradicted by the very fact that the Father had been having individual access to the Son every Saturday, since the Consent Order, from 1.15pm to about 4.30pm (before the Daughter joined them) and importantly, the Mother was in full agreement with him continuing with his Saturday Access. Under the terms of his Weekday Access in the Consent Order, the Mother had also agreed to the Father fetching the Son every Tuesday from his kindergarten and thereafter having his individual access to the Son from about 1.15pm until about 4.30pm (before the Daughter joined them) and the Father had been doing this for about two and half months since the Consent Order and prior to the Son’s move to J School.

31     Further, I noted that in response to the Mother’s proposed new terms for the Wednesday access (set out at paragraph 28 above), the Father had really only one request and that was that the agreed handover terms recorded in the Consent Order for the Weekday Access be followed as closely as possible on Wednesdays. This was not an unreasonable request. As I understood it, the Father’s position was that the Son had always looked forward excitedly to him picking him from his kindergarten on Tuesdays and both had enjoyed this precious one-on-one time together. As such, the Father wanted to be able to continue fetching the Son from school after it ends (albeit now at 3.40pm) and for the Mother to continue to drop off the Daughter at Home at 4.30pm. Here, I noted that if the Mother’s concern was that the Father would not be at Home by 4.30pm on Wednesdays with the Son (given the longer travelling time from the Son’s new school to the Home), then it would have been reasonable and within her control to drop the Daughter off later at 5.00pm. After all, under her proposed new terms, she had wanted the Father to fetch both Children from her residence at about 5.00pm.

32     The Father had also confirmed with J School directly that parents were not precluded from making separate arrangements with the school to pick up their children. As such, the Mother could have accommodated his one request and followed as closely as possible the agreed handover terms in the Consent Order.

33     The Mother had also contended that with the demands of the Son’s new schooling schedule, the Son needed a substantial amount of time to complete his homework and attend his extra-curricular activities, and he also needed sufficient time for rest on weekdays.

34     However, I noted that the Mother had scheduled the Son for (a) tennis lessons on Monday (4.30-5.30pm) and (b) soccer lessons 3 times a week on Tuesday (5-6.30pm), Thursday (6-7.30pm) and Saturday (9-10.30am). In addition, the Son also had enrichment classes for Japanese and Mathematics every Friday (5.15-6.55pm). At this time, the Son was 7 years old and just starting his primary school education. If the Son was in need of more time for school homework or rest during the weekdays, then the Mother (as the care parent) could have reduced the number of soccer lessons or tennis lessons. No explanation was given as to why the Son had to have 3 soccer classes a week in addition to his 2 tennis classes. It was noted that these were all private classes arranged by the Mother for the child and not part of the school curriculum.

35     The Mother also claimed that the Daughter needed time for rest and for homework. I noted that the Daughter too had many scheduled extra-curricular activities. She had swimming 3 times a week on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays (3.15-4.15pm). On Saturdays, the Daughter also attended Japanese Supplementary School from 1.30pm to 4.30pm. These arrangements were all under the purview of the Mother as the care parent. Again, if the Daughter needed more time for rest or for homework, she could have reduced her extra-curricular activities. Also, based on the evidence before me, I was of the view that the Daughter (at 12) was capable of letting her father know whenever she needed time or his help to complete her homework. I accepted the Father’s evidence that he had no issues helping the Children with their homework during his access time with them. There was no reason to deny him entirely of all his Weekday Access and FaceTime Access rights granted under the Consent Order.

36     Having regard to the observations stated in the Initial Report and to ensure that the Father and Children continued to have a close and loving relationship, it was more important and in the welfare of the Children for the Mother to have maintained a weekday access for the Father and the Children (as was set out in the Consent Order) together with the FaceTime Access, and it was feasible for her to have made arrangements since May 2018 to achieve this.

37     I turn now to address the other concerns that the Mother had raised (in May 2018 and at the hearing) to support her case that the Father should not, in the interim and pending the AMs, have more access than his Saturday Access to the Children. These were essentially concerns about the Father’s conduct and his breaches of the Consent Order. The Mother claimed that he was incapable of caring for the Children in a responsible manner and he did not have the ability to manage the Children if he was allowed to have separate access time with each of them on a weekday.

38     I noted the Father’s admission of his mistake in breaching his undertaking (in the Consent Order) not to consume alcohol during his access with the Children. He had admitted to doing this on 3 occasions (between February and early March 2018) whilst having meals with the Children. According to the Father, the last time he had done this was on 3 March 2018 (when he drank a pint of beer during dinner with the Children). He had apologised for his mistake and had promised not to breach his undertaking again. Before me, there was no evidence adduced of any further such similar breaches by the Father and he was also willing to continue to undertake not to consume alcohol before or during his access with the Children.

39     As for the Mother’s various other allegations against the Father: (a) that he had forced through unsanctioned access sessions with the Son (by presenting himself unannounced at the Son’s soccer sessions); (b) that he had failed to abide by and or had repeatedly missed the FaceTime slots as provided in the Consent Order, and (c) that he had habitually returned the Children late after his access sessions, I had considered her account as well as the Father’s explanations for them and on balance, I did not find them to be flagrant breaches on his part. In particular, for the soccer sessions, the Father’s evidence was that the Son had asked him to come and watch him play. I did not find this unbelievable given the close relationship between the Son and the Father (as was noted in the Initial Report) and the fact that the Father had brought him for soccer training in the past. More importantly, these episodes showed that the parties needed to learn to be better co-parents, for the welfare of their Children. They needed to have better communication, understanding and co-operation as parents of their Children and they needed to manage their conflicts so that these conflicts would not affect their Children negatively.

40     I was also not persuaded on the evidence before me that the Father was not able to manage the Children independently or properly if he was given more access time or separate access time with each of them. As mentioned earlier, the Father had been having separate access time with the Son on Saturdays (from about 1.15pm to about 4.30pm) since the Consent Order (1 February 2018). At the time of the hearing, more than one year had already passed and the Children were now both older. The Son, who is 8 years old this year, would have become used to spending time with his Father on his own without the presence of his sister on Saturdays.

41     Secondly, as mentioned earlier, the Father was willing at the hearing to continue to undertake not to consume alcohol before and during his access with the Children. Since April 2018, there has also not been any objective evidence to suggest that the Children have been placed in any danger by the Father or that they are afraid of him. The Mother had made much about how irresponsible and unprepared the Father was in March this year when the Father took the Children to East Coast Park for an outing. Admittedly, clear and more advanced notice should have been given by the Father to the Mother (given that it was an outing to the beach). If that had been done, appropriate wear and other necessities could have been prepared ahead of time for the Children. It appeared that the Father had only emailed the Mother at about 9am that morning stating simply that she was to provide swimwear and googles for the Children. As the Father did not provide more details, the Daughter had assumed that they were going to be swimming at the pool at Home and she decided not to bring her swimwear with her. To my mind, this was a rather unfortunate thing to have happened. But, I noted that the Father was sensitive to his Daughter’s disappointment and to lift her spirits, he took her out later to eat her favourite seafood dish and they had a good time.

42     At the end, having heard the parties and all considered, I did not find the Father to be a parent incapable of caring for his Children independently or properly. But, I noted that he had found it challenging at times given the limited time he had with them on Saturday and also because they were at different cognitive levels and age, and they also had different interests and emotional needs and consequently, he had prayed for more and separate access time with each of them.

43     I refer now to the Specific Issues Report (“SIR”) provided in May 2019. I had called for the SIR in April 2019 given the allegations that the parties had made against each other and the Mother’s actions in limiting the Father to his Saturday Access since May 2018. This confidential report provided some valuable insights into these matters, the current relationship between each of the parties and the Children and also how the Children have been faring and their wishes.

44     It should be noted that by the time the SIR was ordered, more than a year had passed since the dates of the observations stated in the Initial Report on the loving relationship between the Father and the Children. The SIR noted that the Children were protective of their Mother as she was their primary caregiver and they shared a strong attachment with her. However, despite this strong attachment, both Children indicated their desire to preserve and maintain their relationship with their Father.

45     However, the SIR noted that there was a certain level of gatekeeping by the Mother and cautioned that if this continued, it could compromise the Children’s relationship with the Father in the long term. It was further noted that if the Children were to continue to have limited contact with the Father, there was a possibility that they would in future become alienated from the Father. There was, in my view, a real need for the Father to have more frequent access to the Children than what he had currently on Saturdays.

46     Furthermore, it was observed that the Daughter wanted her Father to know her better and she wanted her Father to do with her the things she wanted to do during their time together. The Daughter indicated that this was currently not possible during their Saturday joint access time as she and her brother had different interests and she understood that her Father had to accede to the wishes of her brother as he was younger and needed more attention. But, whilst she wanted to have more opportunities with her Father, she was not keen to increase the current access as that would mean less time for school work which could affect her results. As for the Son, he also shared his preference not to have any access sessions during the weekdays. His reason was that he would be tired after his soccer sessions. Whilst he had displayed spontaneous and deep affection for the Father during the observed sessions stated in the Initial Report, he was less expressive about his Father at the interview sessions for the SIR.

47     Whilst I noted the wishes of the Children, I was mindful that I had to consider what was in their best interests given what had happened since October 2017 through to now as set out above, together with the observations and recommendations set out in the 2 reports (the Initial Report and the SIR) the objectivity of which was not in doubt.

48     In this regard, I was of the view that it was critical to maintain the warm and loving relationship between the Father and the Children that had been observed in December 2017 and January 2018, a few months after the Mother left the Home with them. Efforts should have been made to maintain and improve that relationship. Unfortunately, the Mother unilaterally cancelled Weekday and FaceTime Access rights of the Father (against the terms of the Consent Order). Notwithstanding this, and more than a year later, as observed in the SIR, the relationship between the Father and the Children was still generally positive although there were the concerns of gatekeeping and possible future alienation highlighted earlier at paragraph 45.

49     As I agreed that the Children were at different cognitive levels and had different interests and emotional needs and having considered their wishes and feelings, I was also of the view that it would be beneficial in this case to grant the Father and each child separate time together. As between the 2 siblings, this would also work for the better to reduce any rivalry and jealousy between them for their Father’s attention and affections.

50     Taking into consideration all of the above, I therefore granted the Father in the interim and pending the AMs, separate weekday access sessions with each child (in addition to the existing Saturday Access), and access on half of all public holidays, on an alternate basis (from 9.30am to 8.30pm) and half a day for special occasions such as each child’s birthday, subject to school timings (if applicable). I also granted the make up access set out in paragraph 13 as that was fair and reasonable in my view moving forward. I had directed that parties were to give each other advance notice if there were to be any changes required to any of the access times ordered due to work or medical reasons.

51     I should add that I had determined the weekday access sessions for the Son and the Daughter after going through the latest schedules of the Children (tendered to the court on 28 June 2019). For the Son, I had ordered that it was to be on every Tuesday and the Father would pick him up from school after it ends and the Father would be responsible for fetching the Son for his soccer lessons. Thereafter, he was to have dinner with the Son and return him to the Mother’s residence (bathed and changed) by 9.15pm latest. The SIR had recommended that it would be good for the Father to bond with the Son by allowing him to bring the Son for his soccer training. As for the Daughter, separate access with the Father was to be on every Wednesday. The Father would likewise be responsible for fetching her from school after it ends, having dinner with her and returning her to the Mother’s residence by 9.15pm latest. As mentioned, I accepted the Father’s evidence that he would help each child with their homework during this time if required.

52     Finally, for completeness, I should mention that as there was a concurrent need to address the concerns identified in the SIR with appropriate counselling for the parents and the Children at DSSA, I made these orders accordingly which included counselling for the parents (these were to be joint and / or separate sessions as the DSSA counsellors deemed fit), and also joint counselling sessions for the Father and Son, and separate ones for the Father and Daughter.

## SUM 3222 - Interim Maintenance

53     I now turn to the Mother’s application in SUM 3222 for interim maintenance. After hearing the parties, I had dismissed the application on 28 June 2019 for the reasons set out below.

54     As mentioned earlier, the divorce proceedings against the Father were commenced in July 2018, and whilst the divorce was being contested, the Mother had filed SUM 3222 on 10 September 2018 pursuant to sections 113(1)(a) and 127 of the Women’s Charter (“the Charter”).

55     In her supporting affidavit[^4], the Mother alleged that the Father had not provided her and the Children with any maintenance since they left the Home in 2017, except for one payment of $2,500 in February 2018 for the Daughter’s enrolment fee at her international school. Prior to October 2017, the Father had borne all the family expenses and he was the family’s sole breadwinner. As such, the Mother had to seek her family’s assistance to help her meet the Children’s expenses (for their education, various extra-curricular activities and daily living), her own expenses and the expenses for their accommodation.

56     The Mother listed her monthly living expenses at $2,600 and that of the Children’s at $3,200 per child (excluding school fees). She sought orders for the following:

> (a)     interim monthly maintenance in the sum of $9,000 for herself and the Children (at $3,200 per child per month and $2,600 per month for herself) and that the Father be ordered to pay the Children’s school fees as and when they fell due; and

> (b)     reimbursement from the Father for certain expenses that had been incurred for the Children since 18 October 2017 to the date of the hearing. These expenses were for the following items: school fees, school bus fees and fees for various supplementary classes and extra-curricular activities (“ECAs”) attended by the Children.

57     The Father’s case was that he had never neglected or refused to provide the Mother and the Children with reasonable maintenance. In his reply affidavit[^5], he stated that he had provided her the use of several supplementary credit cards for her expenses for the whole family and he had always given her free rein with these credit cards and as such she had never been in want or had to ask him for more money. It was stated that there was even one card with a high spending limit of $99,000. It was the Father’s position that all these supplementary credit cards had continued to be available for her use after she left Home in October 2017 but she had refused to use them. In addition, she also had, at the same time, direct access to funds in their Joint Account in XX Bank (“Joint Account”) and she had in fact withdrawn a sum of $213,852.05 from their Joint Account on 8 December 2017 (this was about 1 ½ months after she left the Home with the Children). The Mother had not accounted to him for the use of this sum since 8 December 2017. She had only informed him on 8 December 2017 that she had taken the monies as she had legal expenses to pay. There was no communication from her that the said sum had been depleted by 10 September 2018, or how much was left of it. Finally, it was the Father’s position that the Mother had also not been reasonable in the communication to him of her expenses and the Children’s expenses before she filed SUM 3222 on 10 September 2018. He did not agree with some of her claims, in particular, her claim that he should pay for her rental expenses of $4,800 per month.

58     The law is clear as to the legal threshold that has to be met under sections 113(1)(a) and 127 of the Charter when a wife brings an application against her husband for maintenance for herself and their children during the course of any matrimonial proceedings. It is this – that before the court makes an order under these sections, it must first be satisfied that the husband/father has neglected to provide reasonable maintenance for the applicant wife and the children and the burden of proof is on the applicant wife to satisfy the court that the husband has failed to provide reasonable maintenance for her and the children.[^6]

59     It is also not disputed that in determining the amount of maintenance to be paid by a man to his wife or child during the course of any matrimonial proceedings, the court shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the matters set out in sections 114 and 69 (4) of the Charter

60     In the recent case of _UHA v UHB and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHCF 12</span> (“_UHA_”), which concerned an application by a mother for child maintenance under section 69 of the Charter, the High Court said this at \[45\]:

> _“In determining whether the legal threshold is satisfied, the court will assess what is “reasonable maintenance” as a monetary sum on the facts of the case, and will take a practical approach to assess whether the parties have reasonably provided such maintenance. Cooperating reasonably as parents is part of parental responsibility whether or not the parents are married or divorced, or were never married”._

61     The High Court in _UHA_ then went on to set out the several ways the court could consider “reasonableness”:

> (a)     First, the court could consider the _reasonableness of the expenses_ in question. The High Court explained that this went towards the quantum of maintenance that the court considered reasonable on the specific facts of the case and stated the following at \[46\] – \[47\]:

>> _“46_      _… Not all expenses are reasonable and the non-payment of such expenses is not conduct envisaged in s 69(2)._

>> _“47_      _Suppose, hypothetically, the mother of a child does not consult the father about enrolling the child in horse-back riding classes that cost $1,500 a month. The father is of the view that their family of five, with a monthly household income of $9,000, cannot afford such an expenses, and such expenses are in any case not the more common ones such as those arising from academic tuition classes or music and swimming enrichment classes. If the father refuses to pay for the horse-riding classes, can he be said to have refused to provide reasonable maintenance? Another hypothetical example is where a mother purchases a car for their 19-year old child and requests the father to pay for the car, being the child’s “transport expenses”. Some disagreement or resistance to less common and reasonable expenses is not inevitably a refusal to provide maintenance. Naturally, this assessment of reasonableness is dependent on all the facts and circumstances of the case including the standard of living enjoyed by the child and the family.”_

> (b)     Second, the court could also consider whether one party _reasonably communicated the subject needs or expenses_ to the other party. And, on this point, the High Court made these comments at \[48\] of its decision:

>> _“…To find neglect or refusal to provide maintenance, the alleged non-paying party must be aware or ought to have been aware of the child’s needs or expenses. A parent ought to be aware that provision for basic needs would be required, whether or not a specific request for basic needs has been made. But where expenses are incurred for items beyond the usual necessities, it may not be reasonable to expect the parent to pay an undefined and unlimited amount at any time when no or little information is provided, for the purposes of finding neglect or refusal in s69(2). The precise facts and circumstances of the case must be considered in assessing the matter.”_

> (c)     Third, the court could consider whether the paying party used a _reasonable mode of provision_ of maintenance. On this point, the High Court stated that an example of a reasonable mode of provision was giving direct access to funds in a bank account or a credit card. But, when the mode of provision was less than reasonable, then the court may find that there was neglect or refusal to provide. Importantly, it was emphasised that the court was to consider all the facts and circumstances in making this assessment.

62     Although the High Court in _UHA_ was dealing with an application for interim maintenance under section 69 of the Charter, its comments were relevant as the same legal threshold had to be met by a wife in an application for interim maintenance under sections 113(1)(a) and 127 of the Charter, before the court would make a maintenance order against the defaulting husband or father.[^7]

63     The first question before me was thus whether the Mother had shown on a balance of probabilities that the Father had refused or neglected to provide reasonable maintenance for her and the Children at the time when she filed SUM 3222 on 10 September 2018.

64     I first considered the issue of what “reasonable maintenance for the Mother and the Children” was on the particular facts of this case.

65     In her supporting affidavit[^8], the Mother had estimated that she required $9,000 as interim monthly maintenance for the 3 of them in respect of their expenses (_exclusive of the Children’s school fees_) as shown below:

66     Subsequently, when she was directed to give a breakdown of her living expenses (listed under item 2 above in Table A), the Mother then stated in her latest affidavit[^9] that she spent an average of about $6,685 per month on their rent and living expenses. For the living expenses component, she gave the following breakdown in Table B which showed an average lower expenditure of about $1,885 per month as compared to her earlier claim of $2,700 (in Table A). As such, I used the figure of $1,885 per month and divided it amongst the 3 of them using the same proportion that was reflected in the Mother’s original item 2 (in Table A) and based on this, their respective average shares are shown in Table B below.

![]([2019] SGFC 0109_Image/[2019] SGFC 0109_image1.png)

67     Upon reviewing the above claims by the Mother and having regard to all the circumstances in this case including the Children’s ages, I found that the reasonable maintenance for the Mother and Children (_excluding school fees_) _during the period after she left Home and when she filed SUM 3222_ to be in the region of about $3,500 per month comprising about $2,600 for the Children and about $900 per month for the Mother as summarised in Table C below.

68     In coming to this quantum of $3,500 per month, I did not include the Mother’s claim for rental expenses as I found this to be an unreasonable expense to impose on the Father. The Mother had left the Home suddenly after the Incident taking the Children with her, to live with her parents. If she could not stay with her parents and wanted to find alternative accommodation, she should have informed the Father first. I did not think it was reasonable for her to simply rent a separate condominium unit for the 3 of them at a monthly rent of $4,800 and expect the Father to pay for this additional expense. Whilst there were PPO proceedings pending at the time, she should still have discussed this matter with the Father first. However, she did not. It would appear from her affidavit and disclosed tenancy agreement that she had, on 30 November 2017 (a mere 1 ½ months after she left Home), entered into an agreement to rent a condominium unit in the same development as where her parents were living. She had rented the condominium unit _together with her father as co-tenant_, for 2 years at $4,800 per month commencing on 11 December 2017.

69     As mentioned, there was no evidence before me that the Mother had ever informed the Father prior to SUM 3222 that she was incurring monthly rental expenses of $4,800 (for 2 years) and that he was to be responsible for that monthly sum. If she had informed him of this right at the start, he could have made other arrangements. They could have returned Home to stay and he could have moved out and found a place for himself at a monthly rent lower than $4,800.

70     I had also taken into consideration the following. The Father’s evidence that (a) he was paying directly for the Daughter’s phone bills of about $30 to $40 per month and also topping up her school card which she was using for school meals (estimated at $200 per month) and (b) his arguments for reducing the amount of ECAs and other classes that the Mother had taken for the Son to pack his weekday schedule. I also had regard to the fact that the parents could have arranged to share the ferrying of the Children (in particular, the Son) to reduce the use of school transport for them.

71     As for the Children’s school fees, based on the Mother’s evidence[^10], the amounts that were payable up to September 2018 are set out in Table D below.

72     It was not disputed that prior to 18 October 2017, the Father had been paying the Daughter’s international school fees and the Son’s kindergarten fees. However, after 18 October 2017 and at the time when SUM 3222 was filed, the Father had only paid for the Daughter’s re-enrolment fees of $2,500. According to the Mother, she had had no choice but to pay for the rest of the Children’s school fees set out in Table D as the Father had refused or neglected to pay for them. In her supporting affidavit, the Mother alleged that the 3 of them had simply been “_left out in the cold by \[the Father\] since 18 October 2017_”. This was disputed by the Father.

73     Given the reasonable monthly maintenance of $3,500 (for the Mother and the Children) and the Children’s various school fees set out in Table D ($38,404 + $3,859.34 + $7,885.90), I turn now to the question of whether the Father had refused or neglected to provide such amounts for the Mother and Children after 18 October 2017 and at the time when the SUM 3222 was filed on 10 September 2018. As mentioned earlier, the burden of proof was on the Mother to prove this on a balance of probabilities.

74     The Mother agreed that prior to her departure from the Home on 18 October 2017, the Father had provided the family with reasonable maintenance. She agreed that he had done this by providing her with supplementary credit cards for her use for the whole household including the Children’s expenses and her own expenses. She also admitted that she had at the same time direct access to their Joint Account funds.

#### Mother had use of several supplementary credit cards

75     In relation to the provision of supplementary credit cards (which was not disclosed in her supporting affidavit), the Mother admitted in her second affidavit that she had in total 5 supplementary credits cards from the Father at the time when she left the Home.[^12] She did not dispute his assertion that one of the credit cards had a high spending limit of $99,000. Her case was simply that about 10 days after she left the Home, she had received notifications on her mobile from Citibank that her 2 Citibank supplementary cards (the “Citibank S-Cards”) had been _de-activated_.

76     It was not disputed that the Mother did not check with Citibank what the de-activation messages meant and whether and when she could continue to use the cards. She also did not check with the Father about the de-activation messages she had received. Based on her evidence, she just did not use the Citibank S-Cards or any of the other 3 supplementary credit cards which were from other banks (DBS (2) and POSB (1)).

77     In response to her evidence on the de-activation messages that she had received for the Citibank S - Cards, the Father exhibited the following in his reply affidavits:[^13]

> (a)     a screen-shot from his Citi - Mobile application to show that her Citibank S-Cards were still active and available for her use; and

> (b)     Citibank’s letter dated 23 April 2019 confirming that the supplementary accounts issued to the Mother for her Citibank S- Cards were open on:

>> (i)       30 December 2006 (for the Citibank SMRT Platinum Visa) and

>> (ii)       3 January 2017 (for the Citibank Cashback World Mastercard).

78     The Mother did not adduce any evidence to contradict the Father’s aforementioned evidence. It was not the Mother’s case that the she had attempted to use these 5 supplementary credit cards after she left the Home and that payment on all the cards had been refused.

79     There was no evidence before me that the Father had told the Mother at any point in time prior to SUM 3222 (or even after it was filed) that she was not to use any of these 5 supplementary credit cards that he had provided to her to pay for her expenses or the Children’s expenses.

80     On the evidence before me, I found that it was the Mother herself who had decided not to charge her monthly expenses and that of the Children’s to any of the supplementary credit cards even though this was her practice prior to leaving the Home on 18 October 2017. The Father had continued to make provision for their reasonable monthly expenses with these cards (as before).

81     On the issue of the Children’s school fees, the Father’s evidence was that he had attempted to make payment for the Son’s kindergarten fees on 7 December 2017. He had attended at the kindergarten and asked the staff there if he could make a one-time cheque payment for the remaining months of the Son’s term or re-apply for the GIRO payment (which he had accidentally cancelled). The staff then called his wife to inform her of this. To his bewilderment, the staff (after getting off the phone with his wife) then turned him away and indicated that his payment was “unnecessary” because his wife had undertaken to make payment of the fees herself. They also informed him that they would update him upon receiving her payment. Both parties had engaged legal counsel at the time, and this event was also set out in the Father’s counsel’s letter of 14 December 2017 to the Mother’s counsel.

82     I noted that, in response, the Mother’s counsel had on 18 December 2017 asked whether the Father would:

> (a)     resume payment of the Son’s Kindergarten fees from January 2018 onwards;

> (b)     pay the Son’s school fees at J School (as the Son would be enrolling in this school after graduation from the kindergarten in March 2018 as previously agreed between the parties), and

> (c)     pay the Daughter’s school fees at the international school.

83     The Father’s position to the above was set out in his counsel’s letter of 3 January 2018 (“the Letter”):

> (a)     Son’s kindergarten fees

>> I noted that, in addition to narrating the events of his 7 December 2017 attendance at the kindergarten, the Letter had set out how the Father had again attended the kindergarten on 14 December 2017 only to be barred this time from even entering the premises. The Letter stated that: (i) he was there as he was concerned to settle the Son’s matters as no update had been given by the school to him since 7 December 2017 and when he asked for reasons why he was being excluded from the kindergarten, the principal had responded that it was on the instructions of the Mother; and (ii) subsequently, on 15 December 2018, in a follow-up email enquiry from the Father on this matter, the principal had replied that the kindergarten had been given the official expedited protection order (“EO”) obtained by the Mother and had been advised that they were therefore obliged to ‘not allow’ him into the school premises. The Letter also set out the Father’s objections to the Mother’s abuse of the EO to exclude him from the school (even to the extent of preventing him from making the necessary arrangements for payment of the school fees) and at paragraph 7, the following was stated:

>>> “_Notwithstanding your client’s persistent exclusion and alienation of our client from \[the Son\], our client confirms that he remains willing to make payment of \[the Son’s\] school fees for the benefit of \[the Son’s\] education and development. Our client will proceed to make arrangements to resume payment of \[the Son’s\] school fees as soon as your client retracts any allegations she has made to \[the Son’s\] kindergarten suggesting that our client should be excluded from the kindergarten premises or from being involved in \[the Son’s\] schooling, and informs our client of the same_”.

> (b)     Son’s J School fees

>> On this issue, the Letter had set out the Father’s denial of ever having previously agreed with the Mother to enroll the Son at the J School. It stated that the parties had previously discussed the Son’s primary schooling and had preferred the international school where his sister was attending. It then went on to state that the Father was taken aback by the Mother’s unilateral intention to enroll the Son in J School without consulting him, and that he objected to this and would be seeking court adjudication of this matter unless she confirmed that she was prepared to keep to their previous agreement to enroll the Son at the international school.

> (c)     Daughter’s International School fees

>> For the Daughter’s school fees, paragraph 9 of this Letter stated this:

>>> _“Notwithstanding your client’s persistent exclusion and alienation of our client from \[the Daughter\], our client confirms that he will continue to pay \[the Daughter’s\] school fees at the International School for the benefit of the Daughter’s education and development.”_

84     It should be noted that at this juncture, the Mother’s OSG 225 and the PPO proceedings were pending. But, the Consent Order which was recorded on 1 February 2018 in OSG 225 did not include any orders against the Father on maintenance matters. There was, however, an order that parties were to attend further counselling and/or mediation sessions with a view to resolving the issues relating to divorce, the Father’s access to the Children and the personal protection orders.

85     Thereafter, there was no resolution on the Son’s primary schooling issue. Notwithstanding the Father’s express objections (set out in the Letter), the Mother then proceeded to enroll the Son in J School in March 2018. I noted that it was only after she had enrolled the Son in J School and paid his entrance and school fees of $9025.45 herself that she then sent the Father an email on 7 March 2018 informing him of her payment and asking him to let her know whether he would “pay this” for the Son.

86     Given his clear position on the matter (that the Son should be enrolled in the sister’s international school which started term in August 2018), the Father then responded by email on the same day asking the Mother for an explanation as to “how long” these fees were for, whether they were for “one whole year” or were they “pro-rated”? The Mother did not reply to the Father’s email query or provide the Father with any explanation of the fees she had paid to J School.

87     Whilst maintaining his objections to her unilateral enrolment of the Son at J School, the Father had then informed the Mother that the Son could school at J School until August 2018 when he was able to enroll at the sister’s international school.[^14] However, the Mother did not agree to moving the Son to the international school and reiterated her position that his schooling at J School had been agreed by the parties before she left the Home. It was also at about this time that the Mother then proposed changes to reduce the Father’s access in the Consent Order based on the Son’s new schedule at J School. As such, in his SUM 3365, the Father had also prayed for an order that the Son be transferred to the said international school from August 2018.

88     Having considered the evidence, I found that the 7 and 14 December 2017 events and the exchange of communication between the parties and their respective legal counsel on 14 and 18 December 2017, 3 January 2018 and 7 March 2018 did _not_ show that the Father was refusing to pay the Children’s various school fees.

89     It should also be noted that during this period and until the time when she filed SUM 3222 and even after, the Mother had the use of her supplementary credit cards which could have been used to pay for the Children’s school fees. The invoices sent from the schools showed clearly that there were options for these fees to be paid vide credit cards and bank transfers. But, the Mother herself chose to pay with cheques drawn on her own bank account.

#### Mother had direct access to funds in the Joint Account and had also withdrawn a sum of $213,852.05 in December 2017

90     I now turn to the funds in the Joint Account. In her second affidavit[^15], the Mother admitted that she had access to the Joint Account and that this access had continued after she left the Home. She also admitted that she had on 8 December 2017 withdrawn a total sum of $213,852.05 (“the Withdrawn Sum”) from the Joint Account vide a cashier’s order. I noted that all these facts had not been disclosed by the Mother in her supporting affidavit for SUM 3222. Instead, she had painted a picture of how the Father had left the 3 of them out in the cold since 18 October 2017.

91     The Mother explained in her second affidavit that the proceeds of sale of about $800,000 from the sale of their previous property at Newton had been deposited into the Joint Account and that “at that point in time”, they had agreed that “_these monies were to be set aside for the_ _Children’s education in the future as well as related household expenses_”.

92     She then stated in her affidavit that she had taken the Withdrawn Sum on 8 December 2017 “_with the sole purpose of preserving our savings for the Children_” as it came to her attention that the Father had been transferring out large sums of money after 18 October 2017 for reasons and motives which were unknown to her and that he did not seek her consent or notify her prior to doing it. She explained that when she left the Home on 18 October 2017, the balance in the Joint Account had stood at “_only around $428,812_”. She said that she only found out about his withdrawals after 18 October 2017 because of the “text message notifications sent to \[her\] from HSBC”. According to her, the Father only started to make these withdrawals after 18 October 2017 and the outflow of funds from 27 October 2017 to 8 December 2017 (vide the Father’s internet banking) had amounted to a total of $150,000 vide a few tranches.

93     The email correspondence between the parties over this matter in December 2017 showed the following: (a) Firstly, that the Mother had not questioned the Father’s earlier withdrawals in October 2017 to December 2017 even though she was notified of them until he had questioned her on 8 December 2017 about her Withdrawn Sum; (b) Secondly, she did not answer his question but had asked him in return why he had withdrawn $150,000 from the Joint Account? When the Father replied that he had had to touch the account to pay for the legal fees for the many legal proceedings she had started against him, the Mother then replied that she too had to touch the account to pay for her legal fees and that that was the reason why she had taken the Withdrawn Sum.

94     Thereafter and up to the filing of SUM 3222 in September 2018, the Mother did not inform the Father where she had deposited the Withdrawn Sum and how much she had used of it. As she had suddenly changed her method and refused to use the supplementary credit cards provided to her, the Father explained that he had therefore surmised at the time that she was using the Withdrawn Sum to pay for her expenses and the Children’s expenses. It should be noted that the Mother herself had agreed that the monies in the Joint Account were for the Children’s education and for household expenses.

95     Indeed, shortly after she left the Home, the Mother had drawn on the Joint Account to pay for pet food in October 2017. The Father had also adduced some bank statements prior to 18 October 2017 to show the Mother’s previous use of the Joint Account for herself and the family.

96     It would appear that after the Mother took out the Withdrawn Sum with a cashier’s order on 8 December 2017, she did not choose to use the Joint Account. However, there were still funds in the Joint Account and she continued to have direct access to those funds right up to the time when she filed SUM 3222 and even after.

97     In light of the above, I found that the Mother also had the options of using the supplementary credit cards to pay for the Children’s school fees and she also had access to the Withdrawn Sum and the monies in the Joint Account for the payment of the Children’s educational expenses, the household expenses and her own expenses after she left the Home on 18 October 2017 and right up to the time when she filed SUM 3222.

98     For all the above reasons, I was therefore not satisfied that the Mother had discharged her burden of proving that the Father had refused or neglected to provide her and the Children with reasonable maintenance when she filed SUM 3222 on 10 September 2018. Accordingly, I did not make any maintenance orders against the Father.
