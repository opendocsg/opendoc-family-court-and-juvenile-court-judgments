care and control – division of assets – child maintenance

5 December 2019

### District Judge Nicole Loh:

1       Parties were married slightly under 5 years when the interim judgment for divorce was granted. They have 2 young sons, aged 5 years and 3 years.

2       Both parties worked during the marriage, the Husband, as an accountant and the Wife, as a nurse manager.

## Orders Made

3       Save for the issue of custody, where parties agreed on joint custody, all other ancillary issues were disputed. After hearing parties, I made the following orders :

> a.     Current care arrangements for the children shall continue until the Husband moves out from the matrimonial home.

> b.     Upon the Husband moving out from the matrimonial home, the Wife shall have care and control of the children.

> c.     Husband shall have liberal access to the children including but not limited to the following:

>> i.       Reasonable weekday access between Mondays to Thursdays upon one day’s notice being given to the Wife. Husband shall pick the children up from school and return them to the Wife’s home by 8pm;

>> ii.       Fridays after school to Sundays 8pm on an alternate week basis. The Husband is to ensure that the children’s homework is completed before the Husband returns the children on Sundays;

> d.     Either parent shall be entitled to take the children out of Singapore for holidays upon advance notice of at least 2 weeks’ being given to the other parent with the travel itinerary, flights, accommodation and overseas contact details.

> e.     When the children are with either parent, the other parent shall have reasonable telephone or video calls.

> f.     No maintenance for the Wife.

> g.     Husband shall reimburse the Wife S$500 being her contribution towards the property at xxx, xxx, Manchester United Kingdom.

> h.     The matrimonial assets consisting the matrimonial flat at Blk xxx, xxx #xx-xx Singapore xxx (“matrimonial flat”), KSL Residences @ xxx (“KSL property”) and $5,826.93 (being balance monies in the parties’ joint account) shall be divided 45% to the Husband and 55% to the Wife.

> i.     To effect the division of matrimonial assets in Order \[3h\],

>> i.       Wife shall transfer her rights title and interest in the KSL property to the Husband.

>> ii.       Parties to obtain a valuation of the matrimonial flat to ascertain the nett value of the matrimonial flat. Nett value = valuation less outstanding loan as at date of the order.

>> iii.       The Husband’s share in the matrimonial flat shall be transferred to the Wife upon the Wife paying the Husband the amount equivalent to:

>> \[Nett value of matrimonial flat + $5,826.93\] – \[55% of (Nett value of matrimonial flat + $49,725.93)\]

>> iv.       Husband shall bear the cost and expenses of the transfer of the KSL property and Wife shall bear the cost and expenses of the transfer of the matrimonial flat. Husband shall refund his CPF account for monies utilised in the purchase of the matrimonial flat together with accrued interest.

> j.     The Wife to pay the entire monthly mortgage instalment for the matrimonial flat forthwith. The Husband to pay for the entire monthly mortgage instalment for the KSL property forthwith.

> k.     Parties to keep all other assets in their own names.

> l.     The Husband to pay the Wife $1,200 per month as maintenance for the 2 children. The children’s medical expenses are to be borne equally between the parties.

> m.     Wife to pay Husband cost fixed at $900 for the ancillary proceedings.

## Appeal

4       The Husband has appealed against orders set out in paragraph 3(a) to (c), (g) to (i), (j) and (l).

## Care and control of the 2 children

5       The Husband and Wife in this case both wanted care and control of the 2 children. There was also a previous interlocutory application for interim care and control and access. I had also dealt with that interlocutory application and had found that both Husband and Wife were very involved in the daily lives of the children. As they continue to live together, they managed to come to an arrangement where they have equal “duty” days in the week, thereby sharing the caregiving duties of the children between the 2 of them.

##### Husband’s case for care and control

6       The Husband’s case for care and control is that he is a better caregiver compared to the Wife because:

> a.     The Wife neglects the children by leaving home regularly late at night, leaving the children in the helper’s care or the Husband’s care;

> b.     The children have been injured in her care, she disregards the need for them to have medical attention or rest;

> c.     The Wife openly uses inappropriate language and denigrates the Husband in front of the children and exposes the children to her actions of destroying the Husband’s property; and

> d.     He has the support of his mother, if necessary, for the care of the children.

##### Wife’s case for care and control

7       The Wife similarly submits she is a better parent than the Husband because:

> a.     She works near the children’s childcare centre thereby she can easily attend to any emergency. She compared this to the Husband, whom she claimed is late very often in picking up and sending the children to the childcare centre;

> b.     She has been the hands-on parent in terms of caring for the children since they were born, compared to the Husband who only recently became more involved for the purpose of case building;

> c.     She is a qualified nurse and is more equipped than the Husband to handle the children’s medical issues, especially with regard to the first son’s tendency to suffer from febrile fits;

> d.     The children have a very close relationship with her to the extent that they do not wish to sleep with the Husband.

> e.     She has a strong familial support from her family in secondary childcare support.

##### Decision on care and control

#### Findings on daily care ability of both parents

8       After considering the evidence, I found that both parties somewhat exaggerated the shortcomings of the other party. In terms of daily care, I find that both are equally able to care for the children. There is a domestic helper to assist in the chores and as shown by their own division of the week, they are each able to take care of the children during their duty days. I did not see a need to go into whether the Husband’s involvement in the children’s life was a recent development as what is apparent is he is currently able to care for the children. The Husband returning home late on the Wife’s duty days does not reflect that he is unable to care for the children. He may have planned his schedule such that his care of the children is unaffected by his activities. In the same way, whilst the Wife did go out at night, I saw no signs that the children’s care were compromised.

9       The Wife, in this case, being a nurse, is admittedly more familiar and equipped with the care of the children’s medical needs. However, I find evidence that the Husband also did his part to find out more about how cope and manage their son’s medical condition. He is not as uninvolved as the Wife paints him out to be.

10     The Husband submitted that the first son suffered serious injuries in the Wife’s care. The injuries that the son suffered were bruises sustained on 3 December 2018, a cut requiring stitches on his leg on 8 December 2018 from an accident on the escalator and thirdly, a chipped tooth on 27 April 2019 when he knocked against a handrail at the bus interchange. It is conceded by the Husband that accidents can happen and children can be injured through play. From these 3 incidents, I cannot make a finding that the Wife’s caregiving ability is compromised. The fact that she is a nurse who has the assistance of a helper does not mean that her children will never have accidents or injuries in their lives.

11     As for the Wife’s allegation that the Husband was frequently late in fetching the children to and from school, I find that this was not made out by the evidence she exhibited. The Wife provided the sign in and out timesheets from the childcare centre but only for a limited timeframe. This showed me that the Husband picked the Children up on time before the childcare centre closed. The Husband also sent the Children to school in a timely manner considering that the Children are in a Childcare Centre which usually does not have a strict timing on the commencement of school. Whilst he may have been late on occasion, I cannot find that he was regularly late. The Husband may not have picked the Children up as early as she did after school (because she worked nearby and ends her shift earlier than most office workers) but it did not mean he was late. In any event, the Wife conceded that in the year 2019, he has been punctual.

12     The Husband also alleges that the Wife delegated all her caring duties to the helper and points to the helper being the one to sign in and out of school. The Wife has denied this allegation and states she was also present. Nonetheless, even if it is true that the helper is the one who assisted in taking the Children to school, it does not mean the Wife is therefore a bad caregiver. The helper’s role is to assist in the care of the Children, be it to cook, clean or fetch the Children to school. There is no point in hiring a domestic helper if the Wife is required to personally perform all the child-caring duties and chores.

13     I accept that there were instances where the Husband was not as familiar with certain appointments or school events or medication relating to the children. I also note there were times when the Wife rescheduled the children’s medical check-up even though the Husband was available to take the child for the check-up. Both have been remiss in certain small aspects of caring for the Children. But by and large, both parents are well-equipped to care for the children. If parties are better at communicating and co-operating with each other, the minor issues that each have with regard to parenting should be resolved.

#### Findings on parents’ ability to care for the children’s medical needs

14     The Husband has accused the Wife of being lackadaisical about the children’s medical issues. He raised in particular that their second son has been facing developmental problems which would have been undetected if not for his intention to purchase medical insurance. The Wife, in turn, believes the Husband to be over-reacting. Both parents in this case, hold slightly different views on how to manage the children’s medical needs. The Wife believing that the child can develop at his own pace; the Husband believing that medical support should be given. Neither can be said to be wrong. This is why, co-parenting on major issues will be in their child’s best interest. Joint custody allows parents to reach a balanced decision so that children do not have medical treatment for every slight issue or have no professional support at all to assist them in their growth and development. In this case, the parents have shown that they can jointly act in the best interest of their child, as shown in a recent episode of their first son suffering a febrile fit in school. Both parents managed to co-parent to ensure their child received the appropriate medical treatment. Unfortunately, perhaps because of the ongoing litigation, parties starting making allegations against each other once the crisis was over and their attention returned to the case.

#### Findings on the party’s ability to co-parent

15     Because of the interim arrangements in place, it appears that despite their differences, parties were able to care for the Children jointly in their daily lives. Although they cast many aspersions on each other’s caregiving ability for the purposes of litigation, it appeared the Children’s lives were managed relatively seamlessly between the two of them.

#### Sole care and control to the Wife

16     From the above, I considered parties had close to equal parenting ability. They would both be able to discharge responsibilities of caring for the Children. Although not prayed for by either parties, I considered whether shared care and control is suitable. I ultimately decided against this due to the following:-

> a.     One of the parents would be moving out of the matrimonial home and the care arrangements of the children in this new home is unknown.

> b.     The current domestic helper who is assisting both parties in the care of the Children on their respective “duty” days is employed by the Wife. She will not be able to live with the Husband and the Children if he has shared care and control. If the Husband hires his own domestic helper, this will be someone who is unfamiliar to the Children and it means the Children, not only transitioning between households and parent but also between domestic helpers who cares for them.

> c.     The older child will be commencing Primary School in 2021. Logistics-wise, it is more difficult to have shared care between 2 parents for children with formal education as the children have a lot more extra curricular activities and more school related materials like uniforms, textbooks, workbooks to be transferred between households. Even if shared care and control is ordered, I would only have provided for it before the child starts primary school.

17     I appreciated concerns in paragraph 16a and b may be mitigated if parties co-operate and communicate well to manage the impact of change on the Children. However, upon considering the transitions that the Children have to make for one year for shared care to be implemented and the transition again when the elder child starts primary school, I decided against shared care and control.

18     Between the Husband and Wife, I eventually granted care and control to the Wife. As stated before, both parties have almost equal caring ability. However, from the affidavits, it was clearly revealed that the Children appear to prefer to sleep with the Wife. Whilst the Husband states this was a situation encouraged by the Wife. I find there is no evidence to conclude it is so. I do agree that she could have done more to comfort the children when they are distressed but I do not see any evidence that she actively interfered or influenced the Children’s preferences with regard to their bedtime routines. It may be that the Children, also being of tender age, just find more comfort in sleeping with their mother. This is in no way, a criticism of the Husband. I note that given time, the children should settle down and have no issues sleeping with any parent. However, given that I am now considering the unenviable task of choosing between 2 equally capable parents, I have to look at these minor factors to do so.

19     The other factors in Wife’s favour having care and control are her working hours are stable and enable her to care for the Children. The Husband has flexible work hours and appears to have arranged to work more during the days when the Children are not with him. If he has care and control, it is not clear whether his work will be able to accommodate his care of the children on a daily basis. The Wife’s workplace is also near the Children’s school so she spends less time commuting to and from work and is able to be more available to attend to them. She is a nurse and would have more medical knowledge than the Husband to deal with the Children’s medical needs. She will also continue to employ the same domestic helper who is caring for the Children now so there will be less change for the Children if the Wife is granted care and control.

20     I then granted the Husband liberal access which also allows him the opportunity to continue to fetch the Children to school if he wishes to. He also has the entire weekend with the Children on alternate weeks. In the meantime, before the Husband moves out of the matrimonial flat (as my orders for division of assets orders his share to be transferred to the Wife), the current interim arrangement where they have allocated duty days to each other is to continue since it works well.

## Division of Assets

##### Value of Matrimonial Assets

21     It was undisputed between the parties that during the marriage, they both contributed equally to a joint account and they used the money from this joint account to pay for their household bills, the children’s expenses and also for investment purposes. Parties generally agreed that assets in their sole names will be retained by each party without division. This is fair given that this is a short marriage.

22     The following are the undisputed matrimonial assets:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="0"><colgroup><col width="32%"> <col width="32.82%"> <col width="35.18%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Property</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Value</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Remarks</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Matrimonial flat</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$437,400 - $135,219.62</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">= $302,180.38 nett</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">The Husband submitted a value of $437,400 and the Wife submitted a value of $470,000.

23     The following are the disputed matrimonial assets:

24     From the table of claims on disputed matrimonial assets in paragraph 23, I have not included the Wife’s claims as I find that there was no evidence that the assets were acquired using their joint funds. In particular, the car was not even legally owned by the Husband but by his father’s company. I listed these claims out for completeness but will not go into the reasons for my decision since the Wife did not appeal.

25     For the Husband, he claimed that the monies taken by the Wife from their joint account and also spent by her using their joint credit card should be put back into the pool and divided (reimbursed) to him. There were no supporting documents in relation to the credit card expenses that the Wife allegedly incurred. I therefore could not determine what they were spent on or the quantum in order to consider this claim. For the joint account monies, it was admitted that the Wife closed the joint account and retained the closing balance of $2,826.93. There were 2 transfers also done shortly before the account was closed. One was a $1,000 transfer to her personal bank account and another $2,000 withdrawn. The Wife did not deny that the withdrawal was done by her. This adds to a total sum of $5,826.93. The Wife objects to the inclusion of such sums into the matrimonial pool because she claims that she had used this amount to pay for their domestic helper’s salary and levy (which used to be paid from the joint account monies). This would mean that the Husband would still be effectively bearing half of the helper’s salary and levy. However, when the Husband asked the Wife to contribute her half share towards the children’s school expenses, she refused to because she claimed that as she was paying the helper’s salary and levy, he should pay for the children’s school expenses solely from his own funds. The Wife cannot keep applying the same funds to 2 sets of expenses. This has resulted in the Husband bearing half of the helper’s expenses as well as 100% of the Children’s school expenses. Since she has made the Husband pay for the Children’s school expenses solely, the Wife should pay for the helper’s salary and levy solely from her own funds and not from the joint account funds. I therefore added the sum of $5,826.93 into the pool.

26     The total value of the matrimonial assets is therefore $346,076.38 + $5,826.93 = $351,903.31.

##### Contributions by both parties

27     I used the global assessment method in dividing the assets as it was clear that during this marriage, parties had intended to make equal financial contributions towards the expenses and investment of the family. There were some slight deviations from their original intent (at times, due to availability of funds or breakdown in the relationship) but I see no reason to differentiate the limited number of assets into different categories for division.

28     The direct financial contributions by both parties are as follows:

29     In terms of indirect financial contribution, as noted above and undisputed by parties, they had put in place an arrangement that they contribute equally financially for the family’s needs. As for indirect non-financial contribution, both parties were working and caring for the children jointly. Whilst parties may have slightly different roles and duties during the 5 year marriage, I find that neither party’s contribution had outweighed the other’s. Therefore. I find that the indirect contribution from both parties was equal.

30     I am aware that for short marriages, the weightage of indirect financial contribution of parties is usually lesser. I therefore gave Direct Financial contribution a higher weightage of 80%, which is still a tad generous given the length of marriage.

31     As I had granted care and control to the Wife, I allowed her to retain the matrimonial flat especially since its location near her workplace and the Children’s current childcare centre will benefit the Children. The Husband wanted to retain the Johor Bahru investment property and I therefore also allowed that. I then ordered the Wife to pay the Husband the difference between the value of the matrimonial flat and the joint account funds that she retains and the 55% share that she should be receiving from the division of assets.

##### Refund of booking fee for Manchester property

32     There was a standalone claim for a matrimonial asset aside from the above. Parties had entered into an agreement to purchase a Manchester property. However, after paying the booking fee, the Wife backed away from the purchase and the Husband funded all subsequent payments for this property. The Wife wanted to claim back half of the booking fee that came from her. The Husband denied that they had paid any booking fee.

33     The Husband relied on an email from the property investment company as supporting evidence. However, I note the email that the company states “Anyway, the booking fee of S$1,000 is NOT deducted from your credit card.”. This does not support the Husband’s contention but on the contrary, proves there was a booking fee of S$1,000. Given that parties’ relationship had not broken down at the point the booking fee would have ordinarily been paid and based on the financial arrangements of the family, there is no evidence to rebut the assumption that this booking fee would have come from the joint funds of parties as per their usual practice. I therefore ordered the Husband to reimburse the Wife half of the booking fee, i.e. S$500.

## Maintenance of Children

34     Both the Husband and Wife had presented a list of the Children’s expenses to claim Children maintenance from each other. Below is a table setting out their respective positions and the amount I allowed:

35     Both parties had submitting that they should bear the Children’s expenses equally. The only dispute was on quantum. The Husband himself, sought monthly maintenance of $1,800 from the Wife as Children maintenance. I have ordered equal division of the Children’s maintenance based on the reasonable amount of expenses that I have determined.

## Conclusion

36     The parties in this case were married for a very short period. However, it appears that on the day to day management of their family and finances, it was functioning well. It is a pity when the marriage failed and because of their respective desire to have care and control of the children, every minor slight or unhappiness with each other is made out into an offence. I note in particular the Wife has been openly insulting and confrontational towards the Husband in front of the Children. Moving ahead in the interest of the Children, I urge parties to remember to act and speak to each other as parents of their children and not as ex-spouses of each other. And even if they cannot achieve that, then the very least is never to expose the Children to the conflict between themselves.
