ancillary matters, division of matrimonial assets

28 February 2019

### District Judge Toh Wee San:

## Introduction

1       This is an appeal by the defendant wife (W) against my decision for their ancillary matters subsequent to a divorce.

2       The plaintiff husband (H) and W were married on 21 September 1990. They have two children aged 27 years old and 24 years old. The marriage started to break down around 2000 when W asserted that H had a girlfriend outside. After that H had another girlfriend (GF) and they had two children (aged 14 and 11 years old) together. For a long time, H separated from W and their children. Instead H resided with GF and their children on a permanent basis. GF became a highly successful business woman and H’s case was he became her consort. Due to GF’s wealth, H led a comfortable life and was able to provide for W and their children. In 2012, parties recorded a court order by consent for H to maintain W at $2000 per month. This went on until H commenced divorce proceeding on 19 March 2015 and an interim judgement was granted on 2 November 2015 on W’s counter claim.

3       The issues to be decided were:

a)     Were the properties jointly owned by H and his GF (the disputed properties) part of parties’ pool of matrimonial assets for division despite the High Court order concerning the disputed properties?

b)     Was H mother’s property part of the matrimonial assets for division?

c)     Should H’s former shareholdings in GF’s companies be included for division?

d)     What should the divisional outcome of the matrimonial assets be?

e)     Should H maintain W and if yes, how should he do so?

After hearing parties, I decided on each issue and made my orders accompanied by written reasons. A copy of my ancillary order is attached. I now explain my decision in details below.

##### Issue 1: Were the disputed properties part of parties’ pool of matrimonial assets for division?

#### Parties’ case in brief:

4       H held several properties jointly with GF (the disputed properties)[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1). It was not contested that GF paid for the disputed properties. When preparing for the adjudication of the AM matters, the Family Justice Courts directed H to commence the relevant application in the High Court (the HC suit) against both W and GF in order to ascertain the third party’s interests (if any) in the disputed properties. If GF was the one who initiated the action, H was to ensure that W would be added as a party to the legal action. H appealed against FJC’s decision but was unsuccessful. How-ever H also did not comply with those directions. H explained that he found it difficult to commence such an action against GF but told GF about the directions. GF commenced the HC suit and made H the defendant, but not W[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2). H contested, lost the case and was ordered to pay costs. GF successfully obtained the High Court’s order that H holds his rights, title and interest in the disputed properties on trust for GF and H shall transfer them to her[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3) (the HC order). H argued that the High Court had awarded the disputed properties to GF based solely on the evidence shown by GF which supported her claim that the disputed properties were hers. H submitted that I should do likewise because the HC order is binding upon me and the evidence in the AM case also supported the HC order. H further submitted that I can only decide on the matrimonial assets jointly owned by H and W.

5       In my hearing, H further explained that he represented himself in the HC suit without any legal counsel. H was unfamiliar with the legal proceedings which were conducted in English which he did not speak nor understand. H also countered that W and her lawyer had ample opportunity to enter as third party in the HC suit if they wanted to do so. H had appeared before FJC as directed to update about the HC suit before the hearing, even though he did not comply with the family court’s directions. How-ever W’s counsel chose not to do so. Even if W’s counsel had done so, the HC suit would come to the same outcome as it was evident from the documents provided at the AM hearing and the HC suit that the GF paid for the entirety of the disputed assets.

6       W’s position was I should exercise my powers under section 132 of the Women’s Charter (WC) to set aside the disposition of the disputed properties by H and GF, because the HC suit was started by GF in collusion with H to deprive W of her rightful share in the disputed properties. Both of them also did not act in good faith by feigning ignorance of the specific directions issued by the Family Justice Courts to include W in the HC suit. H and GF omitted relevant information from the HC Judge. These information pertained to H’s on-going AM proceeding, their relationship and how they manage their finances, applicable information from H’s AM papers and the directions from the FJC to include W as a third party in the HC suit. H also held differing positions throughout the AM proceeding on the disputed properties and his positions were therefore not credible[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4). More-ever H had in his affidavit detailed his liabilities towards the disputed properties[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5). H’s share of the disputed properties should be included in the pool of matrimonial assets for division. W estimated that H’s salary amounts would amount to at least $ 1.79 million for the 15 years he had been working with GF. This was objected by H who countered that there were no evidence of such income levels and the estimation was not acceptable. H also countered that section 132 of the WC did not apply in our case. Section 132 empowers the court to set aside and prevent disposition intended to defeat claims to maintenance. Hence it is only right that such disposal was voluntary in nature which was not the case here. In the present instance H was ordered to transfer the properties to GF by the HC.

#### Decision and reasons:

7       I was not persuaded that section 132 applied to our present instance. I accepted H’s argument that section 132 envisaged a disposition of property within the disposing party’s control. Hence I declined W’s application to set aside the transfer ordered by the HC orders. I agree with W that H’s non-compliance with FJC’s direction to include W as a party to the HC suit was glaring and such adverse conduct would be considered when I divide the matrimonial assets. How-ever the appropriate redress over H’s mis-conduct should have been raised at that point in time. For example, W could have taken up a committal proceeding against H or applied to be added as a third party. In my opinion, the bottom-line was despite H’s conduct, W did not dispute GF’s substantial and overwhelming payments for the properties. While I noted that H could have contributed but they were not major or material. Hence I am bound by the HC order which was made after a hearing. In conclusion, the disputed properties were not part of parties’ pool of matrimonial assets for division. Similarly the bank accounts which were owned by parties for the purposes of housing loan payments were not part of parties’ matrimonial assets.

##### Issue 2: Was H mother’s property part of the matrimonial assets for division?

#### Parties’ cases in brief

8       H’s mother (M) was residing at an East Coast (EC) property with the family before W and her children moved into the current matrimonial property. The EC property was purchased at $2.15 million and sold at $5.25 million. M allegedly purchased a condominium in 2013 for close to S$2.4 million (M’s property). She paid the down payment of about S$1.4 million and took a loan of about S$900 000 with about 80% remaining unpaid at the point of the hearing.

9       H’s case was he obtained a loan on behalf of M because M was unable to do so due to her advanced age. H also executed a Deed of Assignment to jointly and severally pay to the bank for the outstanding housing loan. H has been paying monthly instalment of $6000 and was assured by his mother that he will be repaid for it. H produced documentary evidence of M’s repayment to him in 2016, 2017 and 2018 totaling more than $200,000. Meanwhile M rented out the property and the rental proceeds went to her directly.

10     W’s case was H’s story cannot be believed. While H had asserted that he had to take up the bank loan and pay the monthly instalments on the housing loan due to M’s inability to secure the loan, he also asserted that M was a lady of substantial wealth. More-ever looking at the sale price of M’s property vs purchase price of M’s condominium, there was no need for M or H to take up a bank loan to purchase the property. At the end of the day, the legal liability for the housing loan lies with H. As for his claim that he could pay $6000 per month to service the mortgage loan with GF’s help, W pointed out that H’s salary had been deposited into GF’s account to be managed by her. Hence this was not a case where H did not have any income and the sole source of funding for M’s property came from GF.

#### Decision and basis

11     On balance, I was not persuaded that M’s property should be included as part of parties’ matrimonial pool. There was a lack of evidence that H was the owner of the property. Neither did W make such an argument. While H had taken up the housing loan and agreed to be personally responsible in law, H also produced contemporaneous evidence (from years 2016 to 2018) from M to corroborate his story that M paid him annually for the mortgage payments of the property.

##### Issue 3: H’s shareholdings in GF’s companies

12     W alleged that H owned shares in GF’s companies of which the value provided was untrue[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6). Her position was H merely made a bare statement to claim that he had a 1% share in GF’s company and he was holding that on trust for GF. How-ever he subsequently changed his position to disclose that there were a total of nine companies similarly belonging to GF of which had he had already delinked himself. H sought to rely on the evidence of his accountant since 2009 to provide the value of his shares as less than $3500. W argued that his accountant’s evidence cannot be relied upon for obvious reasons.

13     H’s position was he once held 1% share in GF’s company and was a director of the said company in name to satisfy the minimum legal requirement to appoint two directors and shareholders in a company, before the law was changed. H also hold shares in GF’s other companies and this was no longer the case. The total value of those shares was minimal, less than S$ 4000. This was supported by his accountant’s evidence and contemporaneous documents.

#### Decision and basis

14     I was not persuaded that there was any adverse inference to be drawn. From the undisputed evidence, H took up shares in GF’s companies between 2004 to 2015. He ceased to do so in four companies in 2013 and in another five companies in 2016. From the company names, they appeared to be related companies owned by GF. The number of shares owned by him was very small, ranging from 0.00002% to 1%. The values of the transactions were also low. I found H’s explanation for owning the shares and taking up directorship to be plausible since it was not uncommon for local businesses to adopt such a position. As for H’s accountant, he had produced contemporaneous documents to support his testimony except independent evidence to show that H held 1% shares “on trust” for GF in one company. But the records reflected that H had transferred those shares back to W in 2013. This was way before the divorce proceeding and the issue is therefore no longer material.

##### Issue 4: Division of assets

#### Parties’ case in brief:

15     Parties did not dispute the remaining assets below.

16     As for indirect contributions, W’s position was she was the primary care-giver of their two children after H abandoned the family in 2000. How-ever she did not dispute that H carried on to provide for her and their children. In addition, H also paid for her medical bills, gambling debts and financially aided her family in Malaysia, in times of needs.

17     H disputed the extent of W’s indirect contributions and alleged that the childminding was done by M and he also employed a domestic helper for the family. H alleged that W was also a chronic gambler. On the other hand he had been maintaining the family and also cared for his children. This was shown by his cordial relations with his children. His son provided evidence to confirm H’s contributions towards his upbringing and that H treated both children equally. In addition H’s son asserted that M was a constant in the children’s lives and took car of their physical needs[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7).

#### Decision and basis:

18     I applied the relevant laws[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8) to the facts of our case and awarded W 35% of the total assets. Though not agreed by H, I was persuaded by W’s argument that the duration of the marriage was about 25 years (until Interim Judgement). W conceded that she had made negligible financial contributions throughout the marriage and parties disagreed on W’s indirect contributions. How-ever the fact remained that H had a second family outside the marriage. This can only mean that he had limited time and energy for them. W being the parent with the children would have a bigger role in their lives, even with M and a domestic helper’s support. W’s 35% share worked out to be about S$180,000 which was about 51% of the net value of the matrimonial property.

##### Issue 6: Maintenance for W

#### Parties case in brief

19     In view of paragraph 16, W asked the court to order H to carry on to maintain her. She asked for monthly maintenance of more than $3000 and H to pay for her medical expenses, monthly mortgage payments, utility expenses, conservancy charges and annual property tax. Alternatively, she asked for a lump sum maintenance of S$750,000. She explained that this was the current maintenance amounts paid by H. She also argued that H can afford to do so and his evidence of a reduced monthly income was not to be believed. On the other hand, she had been a full time housewife since marriage. She had no working experience or specific skills to find employment. She was only conversant in mandarin and was diagnosed with cancer in 2010 and was recently diagnosed with a breast lump.

20     H’s case was parties are in their 50s and would reach retirement years in about another 8 years. H’s income status is dependent on GF and he had no control over his income. H rebutted that W was a factory worker, singer before the marriage and trained in hairdressing during the marriage, hence she would be capable of securing employment.

#### Decision and basis:

21     Applying the relevant laws[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9), I was persuaded to order maintenance for W as her share of the asset division was modest. Now that parties are divorced and W has received her share of the matrimonial assets, she has to adjust her life-style accordingly. How-ever I opined that the evidence re W’s current health condition was inconclusive though I acknowledged that W has some health issues and will take time to recover. It would be reasonable to expect W to be able to secure a minimal wage of a few hundred dollars per month upon recovery and transit out of the current situation. W’s expenses were on the high side and had to be moderated. I ordered that H should maintain her at S$2000 per month for the next one year. After that it would be reduced to S$1500 per month. Alternatively, I ordered $2000 for one year and thereafter a lump sum maintenance (LSM) of $1500 for the remaining 7 years amounting to $150,000. This was about 43% of the net value of the matrimonial property. If H elects to pay W LSM, W will get 94% of the net proceeds of the property and H can retain his assets in his sole name/possession.

22     As parties had not gotten squarely what they applied for, I declined to order costs against either side.

[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1_1)Paragraph 29, H’s submission dated 7th March 2018 and paragraph 26, H’s submission dated 21st September 2018. In short, the properties were 7 private properties with purchase prices totalling about S$14 million, 1 Ferrari motor vehicle with purchase price of about S$1.3 million and 8 bank accounts to manage the mortgage payments for the properties. W’s assertion of H’s share in the properties were found in paragraph 24, W’s submission dated 7th March 2018.

[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2_1)See H’s affidavit dated 14th August 2018. In particular paragraph 14 provides details of the HC suit.

[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3_1)Ditto. Page 19 to 21 contains the High Court order in question.

[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4_1)H initially asserted that the immoveable properties in which he owned a share were all acquired after the breakdown of the marriage. H also submitted that these properties were held on trust by him for his GF. Finally H also argued that these were gifts from his GF as an alternate position. See paragraph 66, H’s submission dated 7th March 2018 and paragraph 25 of H’s submission dated 15th October 2018.

[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5_1)Paragraph 67(b), H’s submission dated 7th March 2018 and paragraph 26, H’s submission dated 15th October 2018.

[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6_1)Paragraphs 101 to 106 of W’s legal submission dated 15th October 2018.

[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7_1)See parties’ son’s affidavit dated 10th April 2017, found under page 547 of H’s discovery affidavit dated 5th May 2017.

[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8_1)The applicable law is section 112 of the Woman’s Charter (WC) which empowers the courts to order division of matrimonial assets in such proportions as the court thinks is just and equitable and sets out the list of matters to be considered under subsection (2). It is also established case law that in determining how assets are to be divided, the “broad-brush” approach is preferred. In _ANJ v ANK_ (2015) SGCA 34, the Court of Appeal (CA) introduced the structured methodology to assess the division of matrimonial assets. However, in _TNL v TNK_ (2017) 1 SLR 611, the CA held that the structured approach should not be applied to single income marriages. Cases have held that long marriages lasting 17 to 35 years with children, homemaker wives were typically awarded 35% to 50% of the matrimonial assets or more. Some exceptions where the apportionment in favour of the wife has been less than 35% concern cases where the total pool of assets were substantial or there has been very bad conduct that undermines the cooperative partnership and harms the welfare of the other.

[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9_1)Section 114 of the WC requires the court to consider all the circumstances of the case including the list of matters under subsection (a) to (g). Cases have also stated that maintenance for an ex-wife is to even out any financial inequality and complementary to asset division.
