Family Law – Child Maintenance – Enforcement – Variation – Proper legal basis for claim – Procedural irregularity in commencing action

18 October 2019

### District Judge Azmin Jailani:

## Introduction

1       To what extent does a procedural defect or irregularity prevent a party from obtaining the reliefs sought in an action, especially in the context of family proceedings?

2       In this regard, SUM 172/2019 (“SUM 172”) was an application by the plaintiff ex-wife against the defendant ex-husband for, as framed in her own summons, maintenance for the two children of the marriage “pursuant to” certain provisions of an existing interim judgment dated 23 March 2010 (“the IJ”). However, during the course of the proceedings and eventually in her submissions, the claim was somehow framed as one to “vary” the children’s maintenance, or alternatively, for a “further” maintenance order to be made.

3       As evident from the above, there was a lack of clarity as to the proper identification of the _legal basis_ of the plaintiff’s claim. This, in turn, as will be elaborated below, fatally affected her in the manner in which she sought to commence proceedings against the defendant.

4       After the filing of their respective papers, parties’ counsels appeared before me on 12 April 2019 and 3 May 2019 to present their arguments. After considering the matter, I gave my decision on 18 June 2019 and provided brief reasons for the same. I eventually declined to make any order to the plaintiff’s application principally on the basis that the legal basis of the claim was erroneous, and on its _proper legal basis_, the manner in which she had commenced her action via a summons under SUM 172 was procedurally flawed. On that basis, such procedural irregularity was sufficiently fundamental and fatal to deny her the reliefs sought.

5       Dissatisfied, the plaintiff filed HCF/DCA 75/2019 (“DCA 75”) appealing against my decision. I now provide the full grounds of my decision.

## Parties and the terms of the IJ

8       Parties were married on xx xxx 1999.

9       As mentioned earlier, there are two children to the marriage. The elder daughter, \[G\], born in 2003, was adopted by parties. The younger daughter, \[S\], born in 2006, is parties’ biological child. At the time of the plaintiff’s present application, \[G\] and \[S\] were 15 and 12 respectively.

10     After the plaintiff commenced divorce proceedings sometime in November 2009, IJ was granted in 23 March 2010.

11     For the purposes of these proceedings, the following terms of the IJ in connection with the children’s maintenance are relevant:

> 3.    Further Orders Made

>> …

>> 7.    The Plaintiff shall jointly consult with the Defendant on the choice of educational institution / childcare / school arrangements for the children at the appropriate milestones of the children’s education. The Plaintiff shall inform the school to have the Defendant jointly placed in the mailing list of the schools so that he can be kept equally informed of the children’s progress and activities in his absence.

>> MAINTENANCE

>> 11.    The Defendant shall pay the monthly sum of $5,779.00 directly to the Plaintiff for the monthly needs of the children with effect from the month of the Consent Order of Court. This sum encompasses the following activities of the children and 2/3 of the monthly rental capped at $3,800/mth, such rental to be verified against the tenancy agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the activities of the children and the corresponding breakdown are neither exhaustive nor conclusive of the actual monthly expenses of the children or the actual cost related to the activities.

>> …

>> 12.    For the avoidance of doubt, it is expected that the Plaintiff shall eventually contribute to the maintenance of the two children by securing some form of gainful employment when the children are of primary school age i.e. 7 years old.

>> 13.    The Defendant will continue to pay for the children’s education/fees directly to their school. The Defendant shall also pay for the monthly premiums of the children’s comprehensive medical insurance directly to the insurer capped at $450/mth and reimburse the Plaintiff of any medical expenses not covered by the policies, subject to his consent being sought prior to the expenses being incurred.

>> 14.    The Defendant will, in principle, also pay for the children’s education including their tertiary education when the appropriate time comes. This shall be determined at the appropriate time in the future based on the financial abilities of both the parties and the academic abilities of the children.

12     Separately, clause 3(15) of the IJ provided that the defendant was to pay the plaintiff a sum of $2,000,000 “in full and final settlement of the issue of division of assets and her lump sum maintenance”. There is no dispute that the defendant has already discharged this obligation.

13     For completeness, sometime in 2011, both parties sought to vary the quantum of fixed maintenance for the children (i.e., clause 3(11) of the IJ).[^1] In this regard, the defendant, _vide_ Summons No 18xxx/2011, sought a downward variation from $5,779 to $3,065. On the other hand, the plaintiff, _vide_ Summons No. 20xxx/2011, sought an upward variation of the same provision from $5,779 to $7,297. Both applications were dismissed.

14     Save for those two applications and more notably, parties left all other provisions relating to the children’s maintenance as is.

## Plaintiff’s pleaded position

15     The crux of the plaintiff’s present application was that the defendant was in breach of his obligations under the IJ and, in accordance with the terms set out therein, he was to make certain payments in respect of \[G\]’s and \[S\]’s education expenses. In this regard, \[G\] is enrolled in \[B\], and \[S\] is enrolled in \[C\]. Both \[B\] and \[C\] are internationals schools.

16     At this juncture, it would be useful to reproduce the entirety of SUM 172 as crafted in the summons:

> The Plaintiff applies for the following orders;

>> 1.     _Pursuant to_ clause \[3(13) and/or 3(14)\] of the \[IJ\], the Defendant _is to_:

>>> a.     _pay to the Plaintiff_ the sum of $25,040.00, being the registration fee, deposit, admin fees, payment of the Parent School Partners Fund, fees for terms 1 and 2, and payment of the development fun, within 7 days of the order to be made herein;

>>> b.     _pay to the Plaintiff_ the sum of $1,742.35, being the expenses incurred for \[G\]’s school uniforms, books and school activities, within 7 days of the order to be made herein;

>>> c.     _pay to the Plaintiff_ the sum of $3,760.00 being the expenses incurred for sending \[G\] to \[R\] for psychological assessments, within 7 days of the order to be made herein;

>>> d.     _solely and fully pay_ for the costs of \[G\]’s attendance at \[B\], including school fees, registration fees, cost of study materials and other related expenses that are required for her attendance at the aforesaid school; and

>>> e.     _solely and fully pay_ for the costs of \[S\]’s attendance at \[C\], including school fees, registration fees, cost of study materials and other related expenses that are required for her attendance at the aforesaid school.

>> 2.    The cost of this application be paid by the Defendant to the Plaintiff.

>>> (emphasis added)

17     For ease of reference, clause 3(14) of the IJ provides that:

> 14.    The Defendant will, in principle, also pay for the children’s education including their tertiary education when the appropriate time comes. This shall be determined at the appropriate time in the future based on the financial abilities of both the parties and the academic abilities of the children.

18     From a review of her prayers, the plaintiff simply wanted the defendant to pay what clauses 3(14) and 3(13) (insofar as it pertained to the defendant making the necessary payments directly to the relevant institution(s)) _already provided for_. Put another way, the defendant was simply _in breach_ of clauses 3(13) and 3(14), and the plaintiff simply sought, in a manner of speaking, compensation and specific performance of the same.

19     As can be seen from the above, prayers 1(a) to 1(d) of SUM 172 relate to \[G\], whereas prayer 1(e) relates to \[S\]. I would pause here and note that during the course of the hearing, the defendant’s counsel, Ms Gill, was not objecting that the defendant had confirmed the crystallisation of his obligation to fully cover for \[S\]’s fees in \[C\]. This much is also confirmed in the defendant’s evidence.[^2]

20     The real dispute in the present application relates to \[G.\] The nub of Ms Gill’s case was that the crystallisation of the defendant’s ‘in principle’ obligation to solely shoulder \[G\]’s fees in \[B\] under clause 3(14) of the IJ had not materialised, or at the very least, materialise to the full extent originally provided for in clause 3(14). I would pause here and note that it was _not_ Ms Gill’s case that the defendant need not make _any_ payment towards \[G\]’s education expenses in \[B\].

21     Needless to say, the plaintiff rejected this view.

22     At the hearing, I had queried the plaintiff’s counsel, Mr Goh, on the necessity of prayer 1(e) in light of the defendant’s aforementioned position in respect of \[S\]. Mr Goh’s position was that that prayer was necessary, notwithstanding the existence of clauses 3(13) and/or 3(14) of the IJ and Ms Gill’s confirmation. This was principally in light of the defendant’s position with regard to \[G\]. What is important to note at this juncture was that inherent in Mr Goh’s submission, at least implicitly, was that he was prepared to accept the defendant’s concession of his liability to shoulder \[S\]’s expenses in \[C\]. For that reason and essentially the same reasons why I was not inclined to make any orders in respect of the prayers relating to \[G\], I neither saw the necessity nor the basis to make any order to prayer 1(e). For all intents and purposes, the defendant has affirmed his obligation to cover \[S\]’ education at \[C\], as expressly envisaged in clause 13(14) of the IJ, and he will have to fulfil this obligation to the fullest extent.

## Background of dispute

23     I now set out briefly the chronology of events leading up to the present application, and certain procedural developments after the plaintiff commenced SUM 172.

### Factual background leading to the present application

24     Sometime in September 2017, the defendant broached the topic of the two girls attending international school. At that time, \[S\] was about to take her PSLE examinations, whilst \[G\] was already in secondary school.

25     From then to February 2018,[^3] the defendant had apparently encouraged \[S\] to speak to the plaintiff about being enrolled to \[C\]. After further discussions, the plaintiff relented and parties attended open house events organised by \[C\]. At that time, \[S\] was about to take her PSLE.

26     \[S\]’s enrolment to \[C\] was finalised sometime in June 2018. More importantly, the defendant expressly intimated his confirmation that he would shoulder the entirety of \[S\]’ school fees in \[C\]. In an email dated 5 June 2018, the defendant’s exact words were:

> So its simple, I will pay for it, full stop.[^4]

27     For completeness, the defendant did mention that his parents would be assisting him in paying \[S\]’s expenses at \[C\].[^5] That said, this did not change the fact of the defendant’s clear and unequivocal confirmation to fund \[S\]’s education costs in \[C\].

28     During the period of February 2018 to June 2018 whilst parties were discussing about \[S\]’ potential enrolment into \[C\], it was also the plaintiff’s position that she concurrently raised the issue of, among other things:

> (a)     \[G\] having an equal opportunity to attend an international school; and

> (b)     the defendant fully funding \[G\]’s university education _as well as international school_.[^6]

29     Contemporaneously, it was the plaintiff’s position that the defendant gave his acknowledgement to the foregoing, as well as his confirmation that he would be paying for the children’s education expenses.

30     Sometime in September 2018, parties discussed about \[G\] undergoing an assessment to see whether she was suitable to be enrolled into an international school.[^7] At that time, it was again the plaintiff’s position that the issue of funding (particularly the defendant’s confirmation of solely funding for \[G\]’s school fees if she were to be accepted into an international school) arose, which, more importantly, the defendant accepted.[^8]

31     In November 2018, it was determined by a psychologist that \[G\], who at that time was in the normal stream of her secondary school, was capable of managing the International Baccalaureate (IB) programme offered in an international school.

32     On 3 December 2018, \[G\] sat for an admissions test for \[B\]. The defendant reimbursed[^9] the plaintiff for the cost of that admissions test. On 12 December 2018, \[G\] received a formal offer to be enrolled to \[B\].

33     This was communicated to the defendant on 13 December 2018.[^10]

34     Upon receiving the news, and while the defendant was happy with this development, it was at this point where he stated to the plaintiff that he would not be able to pay for \[G\]’s fees “without \[the plaintiff’s\] contribution”[^11].

35     The defendant’s desire for the plaintiff to contribute (not solely pay for) \[G\]’s schools fees for \[B\] was met with the plaintiff’s displeasure. In her response email[^12], the plaintiff took issue with the defendant’s “alleged inability” to fully fund \[G\]’s fees, and that if not for the defendant’s “repeated representations” that the defendant would pay for \[S\]’s and \[G\]’s international fees “in full for both of them”, she would have focused her energies on local schools.

36     In short, it would appear that the plaintiff took umbrage at the possibility of contributing towards’ \[G\]’s education costs.

37     In light of the impasse, the plaintiff’s solicitors, M/s Andrew Goh Chambers (“AGC”) issued a letter dated 20 December 2018[^13] to the defendant essentially restating the crux of the matters stated above. Putting aside the multitude of pejoratives used, it is pertinent to note in the letter that reference was made to, amongst other things, (a) the defendant’s obligations under clause 3(14) of the IJ, (b) the defendant’s “clear representations” of confirming his ability to fully fund \[G\]’s fees in \[B\], and (c) the plaintiff’s reliance on such representations. In that same letter, the plaintiff asserted that the defendant was attempting to “renege upon \[his\] representations and/or responsibilities”.

38     Put simply, the plaintiff asserted that in seeking to renege from his representations and/or responsibilities, the defendant was in breach of clause 3(14) of the IJ.

39     Most significantly, at the penultimate paragraph of the letter, AGC stated as follows:

> **TAKE NOTICE** that you are to _fulfil your obligations under the \[IJ\]_ by making payment of SGD 25,040 to \[B\] **latest by 27 December 2018** in order to secure the admission offer made to \[G\] by \[B\]. If you fail to do so, _we have strict instructions to commence_, among other things, _enforcement proceedings_ against you without further reference.

> (bold emphasis original; emphasis added)

40     Given that \[G\]’s offer was time sensitive, the plaintiff proceeded to make full payment of \[G\]’s enrolment fee of $25,040 to \[B\] on 31 December 2018 (which the defendant would have done pursuant to clause 3(13) of the IJ). The plaintiff also made payment of other fees related to \[G\]’s enrolment, all of which formed part of the prayers in her summons, amounting to an aggregate sum of $30,542.35.[^14]

41     On 2 January 2019, the defendant’s solicitors, M/s Eversheds Harry Elias (“EHE”), responded to AGC’s letter,[^15] essentially denying the plaintiff’s claim that the defendant had confirmed his agreement to _fully_ pay for \[G\]’s school fees for \[B\].

42     On 15 January 2019, the plaintiff commenced SUM 172. In her supporting affidavit to the application, the plaintiff explicitly stated her reliance on clauses 3(13) and 3(14) of the IJ for payment of the sums sought.[^16]

### Brief procedural history prior to substantive hearing

43     After the plaintiff commenced SUM 172, a case conference was fixed on 7 February 2019. At that case conference, the defendant specifically highlighted that on the face of SUM 172 and P1, the plaintiff’s claim appeared to be more of an _enforcement application_. When queried by the court, the plaintiff then, curiously in my view, sought to frame her case as a _variation application_ for further payments. At the subsequent case conference on 14 March 2019, the plaintiff again sought to classify her claim as a _variation_ of the maintenance order in the IJ.

### Defendant’s preliminary objection

44     In light of the following developments, the defendant made certain preliminary objections to the plaintiff’s claim in his written submissions.[^17] The following points were made:

> (a)     The plaintiff’s claim was predicated on the payment of monies as provided for under clause 3(14) of the IJ. It was therefore a claim for monies _pursuant to an existing order_. On that basis, the plaintiff’s application was “an enforcement application through and through”[^18].

> (b)     An enforcement of an existing order of court (particularly in the context of payment of maintenance) may only be done in one of two ways – (i) an enforcement application under Part VIII section 71 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353)(“WC”), or (ii) the various executionary processes[^19] provided for under r 690 of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (S 813/2014) (“FJR”).

> (c)     In the present case, it was clear that the plaintiff was pursuing the former approach (i.e., an enforcement pursuant to section 71 WC).

> (d)     Under those circumstances, r 20(1) and 20(2)(d) FJR read together with section 79 WC provide that any application under Part VIII WC “must” be made in the same manner as an application for a summons under the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68)(“CPC”) (i.e., a complaint). Also, such application was to be “dealt with” as if it were an application for the purposes of the CPC. In other words, an action under section 71 WC would be conducted (to the extent provided for and/or limited by the FJR) as it were a matter commenced under the CPC. I pause here and note that an application commenced under those auspices would not only be conducted in a completely different manner, but carry different processes and unique sanctions (i.e., the ability to issue a warrant of arrest to compel a respondent’s attendance, and, the default position that hearing would be conducted by way of a trial).

> (e)     Commencing an action under section 71 WC in the manner prescribed above was a mandatory requirement.

> (f)     Accordingly, by failing to comply with this mandatory requirement under r 20 FJR and commencing the present action as a _variation summons_ instead, the plaintiff has not properly invoked the court’s power to grant the reliefs sought.[^20] In this regard, the plaintiff further submitted that this defect was sufficiently fundamental and could not be cured, because it was an error which went “to the very heart” of the plaintiff’s claim.[^21] On that basis, the defendant contended that the plaintiff’s application must fail.

> (g)     In the alternative, and somehow attempting to fit a square peg into a round hole, the defendant made his submissions on the basis that the application might have proceeded as a variation application.

### Plaintiff’s response to the preliminary objection

45     At the hearing, Mr Goh submitted why SUM 172 should properly be construed as a variation application (despite not being worded as such in the plaintiff’s own prayers, or in his own correspondence). The upshot of this submission would be that the _manner_ in which SUM 172 had been commenced (i.e., by way of a summons and not by a complaint) was correct. Accordingly, this court’s power had been properly invoked, and the plaintiff was able to obtain the prayers sought. In this regard, the plaintiff made the following points:

> (a)     At the outset, Mr Goh candidly acknowledged that the prayers sought for essentially stemmed from an _existing_ order or obligation under the IJ. More specifically, the plaintiff was relying on the _existence_ of clause 3(14) of the IJ, which the defendant had breached, as her supporting basis for seeking the various payments against the defendant.[^22] Put another way, neither the plaintiff nor Mr Goh was relying on any new right that had accrued outside what clause 3(14) envisaged. This is clear even from the prayers stated in SUM 172.

> (b)     That said, Mr Goh relied on the phrase “shall be determined at the appropriate time in the future” within clause 3(14) to submit that in a situation like in the present case, where there was no agreement on the ‘determination’ of the defendant’s liability, that matter will have to be resolved by the court. The adjudication and subsequent order by the court determining the proper extent of the defendant’s liability could only be encapsulated as a ‘variation’ of the existing terms of clause 13(4).[^23] The act of _specifically_ determining what the defendant ought to do pursuant to what clause 13(4) of the IJ _generally_ provided for would constitute a variation of the agreement.

> (c)     Put another way, clause 13(4) contemplates a specific and future determination of the extent in which the defendant was to pay for the children’s education, and such determination, _if adjudicated_, would entail clarifying or giving greater specificity to clause 13(4). This act of clarifying or specifying the obligation would constitute, in Mr Goh’s submission, a variation of clause 13(4).[^24]

> (d)     Mr Goh further submitted that had he commenced an enforcement application, it would be anticipated that the defendant would have run the same substantive arguments levelled in this application (i.e., that the fact and/or extent of the defendant’s obligation under clause 3(14) had not crystallised). In anticipating that argument, the plaintiff would have, in any case, had to first vary and give greater clarity to the existing obligation under clause 3(14) before commencing an enforcement application under section 71 WC.[^25]

> (e)     In short, in a dispute like the present, all roads to a resolution must _first_ lead to a variation application. Put another way, the present application was pre-emptive insofar as to give greater clarity to clause 3(14), and reduce the possibility of the defendant challenging a future enforcement application.

46     Against that backdrop, and as evident in her written submissions, the plaintiff mounted her case purely as a variation claim pursuant to sections 127(2) read with 72 and 73 of the WC.[^26] For completeness, the plaintiff’s submissions made reference to a “further maintenance order to be made”[^27], but save for that line, the solitary legal case put forward by the plaintiff was a variation of the IJ.

## Analysis and my findings

47     I now turn to my analysis and findings.

### Is SUM 172 a variation or an enforcement?

48     In my view, there was no other way to classify SUM 172, factually or legally, other than an enforcement action pursuant to section 71 WC.

49     Factually, even on the plaintiff’s evidence[^28] as well as AGC’s correspondence[^29], the plaintiff had characterised the defendant’s behaviour as effectively being in breach of the defendant’s “obligations under the IJ”, and that the defendant comply with his _existing_ obligation pursuant to clause 13(14).

50     Further, in demanding payment, AGC’s letter expressly mentioned its intention to commence “_enforcement proceedings”[^30]_ against the defendant. Whilst the use of the nomenclature ‘enforcement’ in AGC’s letter could not, in itself, be wholly indicative, one cannot overlook or downplay the fact that it was prepared with the benefit of legal counsel.

51     Furthermore, there was nothing in the plaintiff’s evidence which properly sat with the law relating to a variation of an order. There was no meaningful evidence led on the history behind the existence of clauses 3(13) and/or 3(14) of the IJ, and how the current circumstances highlighted the unworkability of those provisions, which in turn necessitated those clauses to be varied.

52     For completeness, the plaintiff sought to characterise the present case as one being a ‘new’ or ‘subsequent’ agreement necessitating a variation, relying on the decision of _UKK v UKL_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGFC 25</span> (which in turn relied on the decision of _AGT v AGV_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGDC 162</span> and _Lai Ching Kin v Ng Chin Chye_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] SGDC 228</span>). I will deal with these cases later, but it suffices to state at this juncture that a proper examination of those authorities did not assist the plaintiff in seeking to rectify the fundamentally erroneous characterisation of her case.

53     Moving on, and insofar as I disagreed with how the plaintiff sought to characterise her _legal_ case, I first start by returning back to clauses 13(13) and 13(14) of the IJ:

> 13.    The Defendant will continue to pay for the children’s education/fees directly to their school. The Defendant shall also pay for the monthly premiums of the children’s comprehensive medical insurance directly to the insurer capped at $450/mth and reimburse the Plaintiff of any medical expenses not covered by the policies, subject to his consent being sought prior to the expenses being incurred.

> 14.    The Defendant will, in principle, also pay for the children’s education including their tertiary education when the appropriate time comes. This shall be determined at the appropriate time in the future based on the financial abilities of both the parties and the academic abilities of the children.

54     At the outset, it was unclear whether the terms of the IJ, insofar as it related to the children’s maintenance, was a consent order. This was not expressly highlighted in either parties’ evidence or submissions. That said, I do note that clause 3(11) refers to the defendant paying the fixed monthly sum of child maintenance “with effect from the month of _the Consent Order of Court_” (emphasis added).

55     Be that as it may, the starting question was – what did the above provisions actually provide? Only when that is established can it be determined whether the plaintiff’s prayers case was truly to _vary_ the above provisions.

56     With regard to clause 3(13), and insofar as that provision is relevant to these proceedings, the defendant was to pay the necessary education costs directly to the relevant institution. On the plaintiff’s case, because of the defendant’s conduct, she had to pay directly to \[B\]. When viewed in that manner, there was nothing in the plaintiff’s prayers which sought to _change_ what 3(13) provided. The defendant simply was in breach of his obligations, which the plaintiff was required to mitigate by making payment to the \[B\] instead. The plaintiff was simply seeking ‘damages’ of the costs which she had to pay as a result of the defendant’s breach.

57     With regard to clause 13(4), a proper reading of clause 3(14) will show the following:

> (a)     The first sentence of clause 3(14) makes it clear that the defendant will, “in principle”, pay for the children’s education when the appropriate time comes. As to what “in principle” is expected to mean, I accepted the plaintiff’s submission[^31] that the ordinary meaning of the phrase was that there was a _general_ acceptance and/or affirmation of the subject matter (i.e., paying the children’s education), with the _specific_ details of the same to be established at the “appropriate time in the future”.

> (b)     The way I see it, the _starting point_ of clause 3(14) was that the defendant would _generally_ pay for the children’s education costs as and when it was due. As to what _specific_ costs and/or expenses in relation to the children’s education was to be paid by the defendant, that would be established at the “appropriate time in the future”, the parameters of which is addressed in the following sentence of the clause.

> (c)     In this regard, the second sentence of clause 3(14) seeks to clarify and moderate the _extent_ of the defendant’s starting liability of paying for the children’s education. This (i.e., the extent of the defendant’s liability) would be “determined” based on the following considerations:

>> (i)       parties’ respective financial capabilities (the “first consideration”); and

>> (ii)       the children’s academic capabilities (the “second consideration”.

> (d)     On the first consideration, I was of the view that this provision contemplates that the plaintiff _could contribute_ to a proportion of the education costs. If that were not the case, then this consideration, specifically the phrase “parties”, would be rendered otiose. That would run afoul of the well-established canon of construction.

> (e)     The second consideration, in my view, addresses the utility of incurring a particular educational expense vis-à-vis the child’s academic capability. For instance, if the plaintiff wishes for either \[G\] or \[S\] to enrol in a particular programme, but such programme is not suited for the child or vice-versa, it would, in my view, not be correct to impose such financial liability on the defendant, at least solely.

> (f)     I would pause here and highlight my reservation as to whether either considerations were intended to _override_ the _starting position_ of the first sentence of clause 3(14) that the defendant was to generally bear the child’s education expenses. As I mentioned earlier, the second sentence of clause 3(14) is intended to _moderate_, but not completely eliminate, the children’s starting obligation to fund for the children’s education. Indeed, this much was confirmed by Ms Gill at the hearing[^32] where she submitted that the defendant never refused to contribute to the children’s education expenses, and was prepared to do so. The real issue was really the _extent_ of his contribution.

> (g)     Should the defendant seek to _completely remove_ this obligation, that is a separate matter which would be incumbent on the plaintiff justifying to the court why such a _variation_ ought to be allowed.

58     When read in its totality, clause 3(14) of the IJ provides for a _pre-existing_ obligation for the defendant to pay for the children’s education expenses, the extent of which would have to concluded at the appropriate time on the basis of the two consideration stated earlier.

59     Against that backdrop, there was nothing in the plaintiff’s case which suggested any _change or departure_ to what clause 3(14) provided for. On the contrary, on the plaintiff’s own case, clause 3(14) was operating in a manner wholly consistent to what its terms provided. Her position, albeit a disputed one, was that on the first consideration, the defendant had, at the material time, unequivocally represented his confirmation to _fully and solely_ fund \[G\]’s fees for \[B\]. As regards the second consideration, by the time \[G\] had gone for her assessment, she was considered suitable for the IB programme.

60     On the plaintiff’s aforementioned case, clause 3(14) had been firmly established by the defendant’s conduct. However, in _breach_ of that obligation, as understood by the plaintiff, the defendant then attempted to seek the plaintiff’s contribution to \[G\]’s costs. Put another way, on the plaintiff’s own case, the defendant had taken the plaintiff down the garden path such that she believed and relied on the fact that the defendant had confirmed his commitment to _fully_ honour the original intent of clause 3(14), without any form of moderation. In _breach_ of that obligation, the defendant made an about turn, and did not wish to _fully_ bear the costs of \[G\]’s school cost. Because of the defendant’s breach, the plaintiff has suffered ‘loss’ in terms of paying for \[G\]’s expenses by herself, and has now come to this court for an order that the defendant ‘compensate’ (i.e. reimburse) her for such breach.

61     When viewed in this light, it is apposite to state at this juncture that such an action for a breach of a maintenance order falls squarely within section 71(1)(a) WC. The said section provides that:

> 71 – (1)    If any person _fails to make one or more payments required to be made under a maintenance order_, the court which made the order may do all or any of the following: -

>> (a)     _for every breach_ of the order by warrant _direct the amount due to be levied_ in the manner by law provided for levying fines imposed by a Magistrate’s Court.

>> (emphasis added)

62     This is precisely what the plaintiff sought against the defendant in prayers 1(a) to 1(c)[^33] of her application.

63     As for Prayer 1(d), I was of the view that the content of the prayers was nothing more than a different expression of what clause 13(4) _already fundamentally provided for in the first place_. On the plaintiff’s case, the defendant had, by his representations, determined that he would fully cover \[G\]’s education costs in \[B\]. The basket of costs[^34] highlighted in prayer 1(d) “that are required for \[G\]’s attendance at \[B\]” would simply have been the determination of what the defendant was to pay. Assuming that the plaintiff was correct, the defendant’s failure to pay for such expenses would be a breach of clause 3(14), which the plaintiff would have been entitled to enforce against the defendant pursuant to section 71 WC.

64     Lastly, as regards Mr Goh’s submission as to the effect of a ‘determination’ of the defendant’s liabilities under clause 3(14), I had difficulties accepting this argument.

65     I did not accept that the court’s affirmation of the plaintiff’s case of the fact and/or extent of the crystallisation of clause 3(14) would amount to a variation of clause 3(14). If a party says that a particular provision is to operate in a particular way, and the court agrees with the party, any consequential order the court makes _in affirming that position_ can never, in my mind, constitute a variation of that provision.

66     The same applies when a provision anticipates a future determination of an event. The fact that a provision envisages a future event does not mean that the subsequent affirmation of that event (either consensually or by adjudication) amounts to a variation of that provision. This situation also does not change in a situation where there is a dispute. The court’s act of vindicating one party and formalising that party’s interpretation over the other can never amount to a variation of the agreement.

67     For those reason, it is clear that the true nature of the plaintiff’s application was an enforcement application.

### Was the plaintiff wrong to have commenced the present action in the present form?

68     As mentioned above, the court’s power to enforce an existing maintenance order is pursuant to section 71 WC, which falls under Part VIII of the same.

69     In term of the procedure to be adopted, sections 79(1) and (2) WC provides for the making of the necessary rules under the FJR for “regulating and prescribing the procedure and practice” of applications under Part VIII WC. More importantly, and as alluded to earlier, section 79(4) WC provides that:

> (4)    Unless the Family Justice Rules provide otherwise, an application to a Family Court under this Part or Part VII (called in this subsection the relevant application) —

>> (a)     _must_ be made in the same manner as an application for a summons is made to a District Court or Magistrate’s Court under the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68); _and_

>> (b)     _is to be dealt with_ —

>>> (i)    as if the relevant application was a complaint for the purposes of that Code; but

>>> (ii)    _in accordance with only such provisions of that Code_, and with such provisions of any other written law, as may be prescribed by the Family Justice Rules.

>>> (emphasis added)

70     These requirements are replicated in r20 FJR. Practically, and somewhat a unique feature of family proceedings, a party who wishes to make such an application would lodge the same in the court’s Integrated Family Application Management System (“iFAMS”) module, which was specifically created for the purposes of, _inter alia_, for applications under Parts VII (family protection) and Parts VIII (maintenance) WC. Other applications would ordinarily be commenced in the conventional way under the eLitigation system. The practical administration of these cases gives effect to the legislative intent for such application to be conducted and treated differently from others. That is the uniqueness of the family justice system.

71     Based on the foregoing, the plaintiff’s commencement of SUM 172 (as an summons application in chambers under r 546 FJR) was procedurally (and substantively) flawed for the following reasons:

> (a)     First, for the reasons highlighted above, the plaintiff’s application was properly an enforcement application pursuant to section 71 WC. On that basis, it ought to have been commenced in the manner provided for in r20 FJR read with s79 WC.

> (b)     Second, given that the plaintiff’s application was _not_ a variation application, it was procedurally incorrect for the plaintiff to commence the present application as a summons as provided for under r 546 FJR.

> (c)     Third, and as further elaborated below, the case was fundamentally flawed insofar as it could never have been a variation application pursuant to section 127 WC.

### What is the effect of the plaintiff’s non-compliance?

72     The next issue is the effect of the plaintiff’s non-compliance.

73     At the outset, it is worth highlighting that the plaintiff’s non-compliance is not solely limited to the FJR (i.e., r20), but also the WC (i.e., s79(4)). The plaintiff’s non-compliance traverses _both_ primary and secondary legislation. As alluded to earlier, Parliament had expressly considered and decided that an enforcement application ought to be conducted in a particular manner.

74     Separately, I note that that on the use of the phrase “must” in both the FJR and WC, the requirement that any enforcement application pursuant to s71 WC be commenced in a particular manner, must, for all intents and purposes, be mandatory in nature. I considered it necessary to highlight this at this juncture to underscore the extent of the plaintiff’s non-compliance.

75     Be that as it may, it is apposite at this juncture to make reference to Part 1 Division 2 r10 of the FJR, which provides as follows:

> Division 2 — Effect of non-compliance

> Non-compliance with Rules

>> 10.—(1)    Where, in beginning or purporting to begin any proceedings or at any stage in the course of or in connection with any proceedings, there has, by reason of anything done or left undone, been a failure to comply with any requirements of these Rules, the failure —

>>> (a)    shall be treated as an irregularity; and

>>> (b)    shall not nullify the proceedings, any step taken in the proceedings, or any document, judgment or order in the proceedings.

>> (2)    Subject to paragraph (4), the Court may, on the ground that there has been a failure referred to in paragraph (1) —

>>> (a)    set aside either wholly or in part the proceedings in which the failure occurred, any step taken in those proceedings or any document, judgment or order in those proceedings, or exercise its powers under these Rules to allow such amendments (if any) to be made; and

>>> (b)    make such order (if any) dealing with the proceedings generally as it thinks fit.

>> (3)    The Court may make an order under paragraph (2) on such terms as to costs or otherwise as it thinks just.

>> (4)    The Court must not wholly set aside any proceedings or the originating process by which the proceedings were begun on the ground that the proceedings were required by these Rules to be begun by some other originating process.

76     For completeness, r 37(2)(a) FJR does provide that the aforementioned rules would apply, “with the necessary modifications,” to proceedings under Part VIII WC. It is unclear from the literature the nature and extent of such modifications insofar as it would relate to an application under Part VIII WC. Be that as it may, I would approach the following analysis as if r 10 FJR applied in its entirety to the present situation.

77     Turning back to r 10 FJR, the said rule is derived from the existing O 2 r 1 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322 R5)(“ROC”). This rule seeks to achieve a balance between procedural compliance and substantive rights. While observance of the rules of procedure are fundamental to the any adjudication as they provide the necessary framework for achieving justice, it must be tempered by the principle that a litigant ought not to be deprived of their substantive rights arising from procedural error.

78     This in turn gives rise to the question on how that balance is struck. In this regard, it was highlighted by the authors of _Singapore Court Practice (LexisNexis, 2009)_ (at \[2/1/1\]):

> No doubt, the consequence of the default must depend on its nature and the manner in which it was committed. The effect of the non-compliance can vary significantly. The breach may be non-consequential as when there is an omission to include a non-material detail in a form; or it may be fundamental, as when an application has no basis on which to stand because of non-compliance with a pre-condition (such as leave to make the application). Greater seriousness attends the default where it was the result of wilful non-compliance or reckless disregard, as when a court order is not complied with (in which case proceedings for contempt may lie). The court is entitled to consider each case on the basis of its circumstances, and make whatever decision it regards as just. Nevertheless, despite this broad discretion to cure any irregularity, the courts have refused to grant the remedy in various circumstances. These may be classified under the following categories:

>> (1)    where a curative approach would result in prejudice;

>> (2)    where the nature of the error is so serious or fundamental that it cannot, in principle, be validated;

>> (3)    where the mandatory nature of the rule breached may be construed as excluding cure;

>> (4)    where the rule is sufficiently comprehensive to govern non-compliance (so that resort to O 2 is inappropriate); and

>> (5)    where, although the error is not fundamental, the court will not exercise its discretion to cure it because the substantive application would fail.

79     This above classification was endorsed by the High Court in _Sinwa SS (HK) Co Ltd v Morten Innhaug_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 4 SLR 1</span>. I would pause here and note that the above classifications do not appear to be conjunctive or exhaustive.

80     I will deal with the first to fourth considerations holistically.

81     As a starting point, I would highlight that at all material times parties were represented by counsels. Parties had the benefit of counsel to advise and assist parties in putting forward their claims. This includes ensuring the proper classification of their claims, as well as the proper observance of the rules of procedure. While this does not mean that represented parties are measured on a higher benchmark when assessing the fact and extent of their non-compliance, it would be a major disservice to a client if counsels were not able to adequately frame and conduct their client’s case. In the present circumstances, I found it particularly odd why the plaintiff eventually chose to frame her case as a variation application where all indications pointed towards an enforcement application. Purely as conjecture, it appeared that the plaintiff was seeking to salvage SUM 172 (despite how the prayers had been crafted) by completely altering the legal character of her claim. This is peculiar given that the easier solution would have been to reclassify the claim (to its correct basis), and comply with the necessary processes to commence the action in order to properly invoke this court’s power.

82     After assessing the matter, and whilst I was prepared to accept that there was no _mala fides_ in the error, it equally could not be said that this was an innocuous or technical mistake committed by the plaintiff. This was especially given _how the prayers in the summons was worded_. I would further point out that the issue of the characterisation of the plaintiff’s case was raised at an early juncture of the proceedings, as early as the first case conference.

83     Apart from these concerns being raised, could more have been done to, in a manner of speaking, assist the plaintiff? Could the court have exercised its powers under the judge-led approach prescribed in r 22 FJR to direct that the plaintiff re-file her application? Could the court have taken a more facilitative approach given that it was, after all, a family proceeding?

84     In my view, while the FJR empowers this court with the mandate to control proceedings in a more inquisitorial fashion, it is still not the court’s function (much less obligation) to make a party’s case for it. Whilst the judge-led powers allow for better management of a proceeding, it does not, in my view, go as far as correcting what is otherwise an erroneous case (procedurally and more so substantively). Arguably, the court may be more direct in highlighting these concerns, but for a judge-led approach to be construed as a directive to craft/rectify a case for a party (regardless of whether they are represented or not) would not, in my view, be correct.

85     Be that as it may, would the defendant, in the present case, have suffered any real prejudice? This is especially so given the fact that the defendant had the opportunity to address the factual matters raised by the plaintiff. It cannot be said that the defendant did not conceptually know the crux of the allegations made against him, albeit characterised erroneously and was procedurally defective.

86     Without difficulty, I was not inclined in the present case to have exercised my discretion. As I mentioned earlier, the plaintiff’s choice of characterisation of her case was substantively flawed. Moreover, in commencing her application in the present manner, defendant was denied the entitlement to have the manner conducted as if it were a complaint under the CPC, particularly that the hearing be conducted as a trial, with the plaintiff being subject to cross-examination. This, coupled by my earlier observation above that the mode of commencement was a mandatory rule, meant that curing these defects (a) would result in the defendant being denied a not insignificant procedural safeguard, (b) would absolve the plaintiff from a clear non-compliance of a mandatory rule that, in the present circumstances and the unique nature of different ecosystems in the family justice systems, went to the heart of the legal process.

87     Moreover, any attempt to ‘cure’ the present irregularity would require one of two things – (a) affirming that the present case is properly a variation application (which it was not), and/or (b) accepting that an enforcement application may be conducted in a manner other than what was prescribed in s 79 WC and/or r 20. In that context, I considered these sufficiently far-reaching consequences, which militated against exercising my discretion to cure the plaintiff’s defendant. If anything, this is but a reminder for parties and counsels to carefully consider and frame their case before coming before the court.

88     On the fifth category, I was not inclined to exercise my discretion to cure the plaintiff’s defect simply because, on the case the plaintiff had characterised (i.e., a variation application), the application was essentially a non-starter.

89     As a starting point, the jurisprudence of any variation application has been restated by the Court of Appeal in _AYM v AYL_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 1 SLR 924</span>. While the statements made by that Court were in the context of an order for division of matrimonial assets, I saw no reason why those could not equally apply to a maintenance order. In this regard, at the heart of any variation application is the concept of unworkability, and the existence of any circumstance which has:

> (a)     so radically changed the earlier situation so that to implement the order as originally made would be to implement something which was radically different from what was originally intended (_AYM_ at \[25\]); and

> (b)     invalidated the very basis on which the order was made (_AYM_ at \[27\])

90     As I highlighted earlier, there was, in my view, nothing in the plaintiff’s case which sought to establish that clause 3(14), as presently worded and/or intended, was rendered unworkable in light of the defendant’s actions. Quite the contrary, on the plaintiff’s case, the defendant’s actions squarely affirmed the _fact and extent_ of the defendant’s obligations under clause 3(14). On that basis, there was nothing in the plaintiff’s case which would necessitate invoking the court’s powers under section 72, 73, or even 127(2) WC.

91     To that end, the plaintiff’s reliance on the decision of _UKK v UKL_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGFC 25</span> (“_UKK_”) or _AGT v AGV_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGDC 162</span> (“_AGT”_) are of little assistance to the plaintiff as it deals with a variation application. In _UKK_, the husband applied for a downward variation of fixed maintenance from $3,400 to $1,000. In _AGT_, the husband sought to reduce the amount of fixed maintenance on account of his alleged new expenses.

92     At this, I do note from the plaintiff’s submission that she relied on the following phrase in _AGT_ (which was reproduced in _UKK_) on how a variation may arise: [^35]

> Whether parties had a _subsequent agreement_ on the amount of maintenance to be paid _notwithstanding the maintenance order made in court_ (see pp 4-16 of Lai Chin Kin v Ng Chin Chye <span class="citation">\[2001\] SGDC 228</span>

93     Again, from the brief summary provided in _UKK_, the case of _Lai Chin Kin v Ng Chin Chye_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] SGDC 228</span> (“_Lai Chin Kin”_) deals with a situation where a party sought to _depart from_ what the original terms of the maintenance order provided. In _Lai Chin Kin_, the complainant wife sought to _enforce_ an order of court by the High Court (“HCORC”) where the respondent was to pay the complainant and the three children monthly maintenance of $2,000. The complainant claimed arrears amounting to approximately $38,500 from June 1998 to May 2001. In disputing the quantum claimed by the complainant, the respondent alleged that there was a separate agreement between parties where the respondent only had to pay $1,000 in maintenance notwithstanding what the original order provided. The respondent had faithfully been paying that amount up till December 2000. On that basis, the respondent’s calculation of the arrears was $5,500.

94     After assessing the matter, the court in _Lai Chin Kin_ broadly agreed that on the facts, there was indeed an agreement to reduce the monthly maintenance sum notwithstanding the order, and after making certain adjustments, valued the arrears to be $8, 550.

95     What must be noted in _Lai Chin Kin_ was that the court was prepared to _change and modify_ the effect of the HCORC for the purposes of determining the quantum of arrears to be repaid _in an enforcement application_. In this regard, it was clear in that decision that to reduce the respondent’s arrears arising from the was premised on a _newly_ crafted agreement _which departed from the original terms of HCORC_. In this regard, the respondent was able to ‘show cause’ why the entire sum claimed by the complainant was not justified, and gave effect to the ‘new agreement’ that was contrary to the HCORC. Ultimately, _Lai Chin Kin_ stands for the proposition on how a “new” agreement may be made to override an existing agreement or order.

96     Again, this was _not_ the situation in the present case.

97     For the above reasons, I was not inclined to cure the procedural irregularity in commencing SUM 172, in actuality, and enforcement application not in compliance with r 20 FJC and s 79 WC. As I was mindful of what was cited in r 10 (4) FJR, I was not inclined to dismiss the application in its entirety. Instead, I was more inclined not to make any orders to the plaintiff’s present application.

## Costs

98     After considering parties’ submissions, and whilst I was mindful of the effort expended by the defendant, I was of the view that it was more appropriate not to make any cost orders in the circumstances.

## Supplementary comments

99     Notwithstanding my decision, I found it apposite to make some concluding comments (albeit _obiter_):

> (a)     First, clause 3(14) does clearly envisage the plaintiff potentially contributing to the children’s education. Whilst it broadly notes their respective financial positions, I had difficulty why the plaintiff was not open, at the very least, to a conversation on contribution. This is especially again the backdrop of the defendant affirming his commitment to fully pay for \[S\].

> (b)     Second, and following from the first, and particularly Ms Gill’s submission at the hearing that the issues was never _whether_ the defendant should pay, but _how much_, perhaps this can be a platform for parties to come to some reasonable consensus for the children’s sake

## Conclusion

100    For those reasons, I made no orders to both the plaintiff’s application as well as costs. It leaves me to thank Mr Goh, Ms Gill and their respective teams for their assistance, on what I considered an interesting procedural issue unique to family proceedings. As I mentioned at \[87\], I hope this case serves as a guide for parties and counsels to ensure they are clear and firm on the nature of the legal case they wish to put forward before this court.
