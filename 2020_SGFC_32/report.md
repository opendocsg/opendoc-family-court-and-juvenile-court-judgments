Family Law – Divorce – Unreasonable Behaviour

31 March 2020

### District Judge Eugene Tay:

## Introduction

1       This is the Plaintiff husband’s appeal against my decision to dismiss his Writ for Divorce on 14 January 2020.

## Background

2       The Plaintiff married the Defendant wife on 7 June 1999 in Singapore. They have a son to the marriage, born on xx xxx 2005 (“the Child”). At the time of the hearing of this case, the Plaintiff was 47 years old and working in a management position in \[C\], while the Defendant was 49 years old and a home-maker.

3       Parties lived together at the matrimonial home at \[Property 1\] (“the Matrimonial Home”) until 30 December 2018. On 31 December 2018, the Plaintiff moved out of the Matrimonial Home and rented another place outside, while the Defendant continued to reside in the Matrimonial Home[^1].

4       The Plaintiff filed for divorce on 18 February 2019 against the Defendant under section 95(3)(b) of the Women’s Charter Cap. 353 (“WC”) on the basis that the Defendant has behaved in such way that he cannot reasonably be expected to live with her. The Defendant contested the Plaintiff’s claim and filed her Defence but did not file a Counterclaim. Both parties were represented by counsel at the trial.

5       After considering the evidence and submissions, I dismissed the Plaintiff’s claim on 14 January 2020, and awarded the Defendant costs fixed at $11,000.00 excluding reasonable disbursements to be agreed or taxed.

6       On 23 January 2020, the Plaintiff, through his counsel, filed his Notice of Appeal against my decision. I now set out the grounds for my decision.

## The Plaintiff’s case

7       The Plaintiff relied on the following behaviour on the part of the Defendant in support of his claim that she had behaved in such a way that he cannot reasonably be expected to continue living with her[^2]:

> (a)     The Defendant has a short temper and was verbally abusive towards the Plaintiff, wherein she would make deprecating remarks at him.

> (b)     The Defendant’s attitude and manner towards the Plaintiff’s family were very disrespectful, which caused tensions to arise between the Plaintiff and his family.

> (c)     The Defendant’s method of punishing the Child was very harsh and unnecessary.

> (d)     The Defendant has failed to show sufficient care, affection and appreciation for the Plaintiff during the course of the marriage.

> (e)     The Defendant emotionally blackmailed and manipulated the Plaintiff after he had informed her of his intention to divorce her.

## The Defendant’s case

8       The Defendant denies all the above allegations. She submitted that the Plaintiff has not discharged the burden of proving that she has behaved in such a way that it would be unreasonable for him to live with her[^3]. She raised the following points[^4]:

> (a)     The Defendant is not the unreasonable person the Plaintiff has made her out to be.

> (b)     The Plaintiff has not made out a case for divorce based on the Defendant’s unreasonable behaviour but he has instead raised to the Court’s attention that he wishes to divorce the Defendant because he wants to marry another woman.

> (c)     The Court should not allow the marriage to be dissolved on the basis of an unfounded case of unreasonable behaviour.

## The Applicable Legal Principles

9       Under section 95(1) of the WC, the sole ground of divorce is that the marriage has irretrievably broken down. One of the facts that the Plaintiff has to satisfy the court is under section 95(3)(b) of the WC, which states that the court shall not hold the marriage to have broken down irretrievably unless the Plaintiff satisfies the court that the Defendant has behaved in such a way that the Plaintiff cannot reasonably be expected to live with the Defendant.

10     The test in determining whether a Defendant has behaved in such a way that the Plaintiff cannot reasonably be expected to live with the Defendant was laid out in the case of _Wong Siew Boey v Lee Boon Fatt_ <span class="citation">\[1994\] SGHC 35</span> (“_Wong Siew Boey_”), and affirmed and restated in the case of _Teo Hoon Ping v Tan Lay Ying Angeline_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGHC 244</span> at \[36\] to \[37\] as follows:

> _“36_      _The test for determining whether a spouse has behaved in such way that the other spouse cannot reasonably be expected to live with him or her was laid down in the case of Wong Siew Boey v Lee Boon Fatt <span class="citation">\[1994\] 1 SLR(R) 323</span> (“Wong Siew Boey”). This test requires the court to ask if the Plaintiff, with his or her characteristics and personality, with his or her faults and other attributes, good and bad, and having regard to his or her behaviour during the marriage, can reasonably be expected to live with the Defendant._

> _37_      _The test as stated is an objective one that requires the court to take into account the subjective qualities of the Plaintiff_. …”

11     In _Wong Siew Boey_, it was also stated at \[13\] that the court must look at behaviour by taking into account the cumulative effect of behaviour, and that all behaviour may be taken into account where it has reference to the marriage, including behaviour towards other members of the family or towards outsiders.

## The Court’s findings

12     In dismissing the Plaintiff’s claim on 14 January 2020, I had provided salient reasons for my decision, which I will set out below and elaborate where necessary. I will deal with the Plaintiff’s allegations in turn.

### The Plaintiff claimed that the Defendant has a short temper and was verbally abusive towards him, wherein she would make deprecating remarks at him

13     In relation to the Defendant’s alleged short temper, the Plaintiff only provided details of five occasions in which he claimed the Defendant had admitted to being angry, and the period was between January 2016 and April 2018, over a span of more than two years[^5]. Apart from these, no other details or evidence of the dates or periods the Defendant had allegedly gotten angry at the Plaintiff were furnished.

14     For the messages in January 2016 and March 2017[^6] supposedly showing that the Defendant was angry with the Plaintiff, apart from stating the Defendant sometimes got upset with him over minor or small things, the Plaintiff did not provide more details or evidence on the circumstances or reasons why the Defendant had supposedly gotten upset with him. On the other hand, the Defendant did not deny she got angry with the Plaintiff over certain trivial matters. Her evidence, which was not challenged or rebutted, was that these instances occurred when the Plaintiff committed the same mistakes and/or did not pay sufficient attention to what she had told him[^7]. However, in my view, this does not necessarily mean she has a short temper and/or was verbally abusive towards the Plaintiff.

15     As for the incident involving the Plaintiff packing the wrong vest in November 2017[^8], I noted the Plaintiff himself had admitted that he could not confirm (and indeed did not clarify) whether the Defendant was silent due to anger or fatigue[^9]. I was prepared to find that the Defendant was frustrated with the Plaintiff for packing the wrong vest. I was, however, not persuaded that the Defendant being frustrated and/or keeping silent as a result of the Plaintiff packing the wrong vest was unreasonable.

16     With respect to the allegation that Defendant was angry at the Plaintiff for being half an hour late to return home due to traffic jam in April 2018[^10], I noted the Plaintiff’s admission that he had assumed that the Defendant was annoyed with him, while he had also conceded she could have been frustrated over the traffic jam[^11]. Taking into account the Plaintiff’s own testimony, I was not convinced the Plaintiff had proven that the Defendant was angry at him instead of being frustrated at the situation.

17     Based on the aforesaid, and noting that the five alleged incidents (at \[13\] above) had taken place over a course of more than two years in the context of parties’ long marriage of almost 20 years, there was insufficient evidence and basis for me to conclude that the Defendant was quick tempered and frequently got upset at the Plaintiff such that he cannot reasonably be expected to live with her.

18     The Plaintiff also claimed the Defendant had insulted him by insinuating he lacked intelligence, and cited the example of her allegedly saying he is “slow and obtuse” as a result of charging his mobile phone next to his side of the bed[^12], as well as she allegedly making a remark in November 2014 that it would be a waste of money for him to go for a course in France if he does not raise his level of intelligence[^13].

19     From the evidence, I was unable to conclude that the Defendant had made abusive and deprecating remarks towards the Plaintiff as alleged by him. In particular, I was not prepared to find that she had insulted him as being “slow and obtuse”. I accepted the Defendant’s evidence and testimony of the context in which the alleged remarks were made, which was essentially that she had advised him not to charge his mobile phone next to his side of the bed close to his head, as it would affect his brain, and may cause him dementia[^14]. In this regard, I also noted that the Plaintiff himself had agreed that the Defendant was concerned about him in telling him not to charge his phone next to him[^15].

20     As for the alleged hurtful remark supposedly made in November 2014 that it would be a waste of money for him to go for a course in France if he does not raise his level of intelligence, suffice to say it is inconclusive whether this remark was indeed made. Even if it was made, it took place more than four years prior to the Writ for Divorce being filed. Yet the Plaintiff continued to live with the Defendant.

### The Plaintiff claimed that the Defendant’s attitude and manner towards his family were very disrespectful, which caused tensions to arise between him and his family

21     Firstly, the Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant had exerted what he termed as “psychological control” over the allowance he gave to his father[^16]. However, I was unconvinced that this was so. This can be seen by the Plaintiff’s own testimony that the Defendant could not stop him from giving his father allowance because the money came from the Plaintiff’s own account[^17], and that he still went ahead to give his father allowance every month despite the psychological impact he said the Defendant had on him[^18]. Also, although the Defendant confirmed that she had advised the Plaintiff against supporting his father’s addiction to gambling at the stock exchange[^19], I did not think that her doing so amounted to forbidding the Plaintiff from supporting his father. At the end of the day, the fact remained that the Plaintiff had still retained control over his finances and continued to support his father financially.

22     The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant refused to attend his father’s 78th birthday celebration without reason and caused him embarrassment[^20]. He also claimed that the Defendant’s continuous refusal to appear at the Plaintiff’s family gatherings or allow the Child to attend has put a huge strain on the Plaintiff’s relationship with his family[^21].

23     From the evidence, it would appear that the Defendant did still attend family gatherings, though with reduced frequency since 2015 as admitted by the Defendant herself[^22]. However, it was only in 2018 that the Defendant did not attend the Plaintiff’s father’s birthday[^23]. The Defendant’s evidence that the Plaintiff seldom contacts his own father[^24], that the Plaintiff’s family did not have many family gatherings in the first place[^25], and that the Plaintiff hardly makes contact with his family members and is not close to them[^26] were all not disputed by the Plaintiff. All these suggest that the Plaintiff himself did not share or maintain close ties with his own family. As such, even if the Defendant did miss the Plaintiff’s father’s 78th birthday in 2018 and attended family gatherings with reduced frequency since 2015, I was not satisfied that the Plaintiff has proven that as a result of these, there was tension between him and his family and that he could not reasonably be expected to live with the Defendant.

24     The Plaintiff also alleged the Defendant shown dislike and disrespect towards his sister, and cited an incident on 27 December 2015 where the Defendant had forbidden the Child from accepting a gift from his sister[^27].

25     However, from the evidence, the aforesaid incident involving the Plaintiff’s sister appeared to be an isolated one in the course of parties’ long marriage. The Plaintiff did not cite or provide details of any other incidents where the Defendant had shown dislike or disrespect to his sister. The aforesaid incident should also be seen in the context of a misunderstanding that took place between the Defendant and the Plaintiff’s sister, which the Defendant had testified in detail during the trial, and where she had also explained her reasons for asking the Child to decline the Plaintiff’s sister’s gift[^28]. Moreover, it is noted that this incident occurred more than three years before the filing of the Writ for Divorce. As such, I was not inclined to place much weight or reliance on this incident. In my view, there is some force in the Defendant’s submission that the Plaintiff did not find the relationship between the Plaintiff’s sister and the Defendant to be an issue, as he had continued to live with the Defendant[^29].

26     The Plaintiff also alleged that the Defendant was calculative towards his family, and would forbid him from paying for the meals during family meals outside and see if his siblings would pay instead[^30].

27     The Defendant’s evidence is that she had only commented once to the Plaintiff that since his siblings were working, perhaps the costs of the family meals could be shared[^31]. This aspect of the Defendant’s evidence was not expressly challenged or refuted by the Plaintiff. Moreover, the Plaintiff himself had testified that it was prior to 2012, which he said was the year his mother had passed away, that the Defendant had expressed her unhappiness about him having to pay for his family meals.[^32] Apart from this one incident, I noted the Plaintiff could not provide further details on when other alleged incidents occurred, such as the number of times or dates[^33]. As such, any weight and reliance I would place on this allegation would at best be minimal, if at all.

28     Overall, based on the above, I did not think the Plaintiff has proven that the Defendant’s attitude and manner towards his family was very disrespectful as claimed by him, let alone that such attitude and manner had caused tensions to arise between him and his family.

### The Plaintiff claimed that the Defendant’s method of punishing the Child was very harsh and unnecessary.

29     On the Plaintiff’s claim that the Defendant’s method of punishing the Child was very harsh and unnecessary[^34], I noted that the Plaintiff only cited a single incident on 27 December 2015 where, allegedly, the Defendant spanked the Child severely and did not cook dinner for the Child as punishment for accepting the Plaintiff’s sister’s gift[^35]. However, the Plaintiff himself testified that he would not know exactly the reason why the Child was punished[^36]. Further, this incident took place more than three years prior to the filing of the Writ for Divorce. Since then, as testified by the Plaintiff himself, in the last two to three years, the Defendant disciplined the Child by verbal scolding, and since January 2018, he did not remember any instance of the Defendant applying corporal punishment on the Child[^37].

30     For the aforesaid reasons, I found that the Plaintiff’s reliance on the Defendant’s alleged and unnecessary punishment on the Child as making it unreasonable for the Plaintiff to live with the Defendant is without merit.

### The Plaintiff claimed that the Defendant had failed to show sufficient care, affection and appreciation for him during the course of the marriage.

31     In relation to the Plaintiff’s claim that the Defendant had failed to show sufficient care, affection and appreciation towards him, it was quite clear that he placed particular significance and reliance on the allegation that over the last few years, the Defendant had increasingly declined to have physical intimacy with him, and that parties had completely stopped having physical intimacy since June 2018[^38].

32     The Plaintiff contended that the Defendant had provided three completely different reasons to justify her refusal to have physical intimacy with him[^39]; firstly, that she found it difficult to have physical intimacy due to the lack of love and affection shown to her; secondly, that it was her health issues that prevented her from getting intimate with him; and thirdly, that she could not have physical intimacy as she was feeling tired and “lost the affection”.

33     The Defendant did admit in Court that she found it difficult to have physical intimacy with the Plaintiff since June 2018[^40], though I noted she did not go so far as to admit that she had completely stopped having physically intimacy with him.

34     In my view, I did not think that the aforesaid three reasons for the Defendant not having physical intimacy with the Plaintiff (at \[32\] above) were necessarily mutually exclusive. There could be more than a single reason why the Defendant might have difficulty having physical intimacy with the Plaintiff, on various occasions. Indeed, I noted that the Plaintiff himself agreed that there could be more than one reason for the Defendant refusing physical intimacy with him[^41]. As such, I found little merit in the Plaintiff’s submission that the Defendant comes up with new reasons for her refusal to have physical intimacy with him as and when it suits her, and that the inconsistencies in her answers served to prove the point that she is willing to say anything to justify her unreasonable actions[^42].

35     Pertinently, I noted that the Plaintiff himself had testified that he did not do anything at all to help with parties’ intimate or sexual life, including seeking counselling or medical treatment for the Defendant[^43]. He had also testified that up to July, August 2018 (which was after parties had supposedly stopped having physical intimacy), he still sent messages to the Defendant to express affection, and did not tell her that he felt the marriage was failing[^44]. Moreover, he had further testified that when he continued to express love for the Defendant up to July, August 2018, the Defendant continued to cook for him, take care of the house and the Child and did all her duties as a wife[^45]. In my view, all these cast considerable doubt over whether and to what extent the Plaintiff was genuinely concerned about the decline in physical intimacy between him and the Defendant, but more importantly, for the purpose of this case, whether the decline in physical intimacy between them actually made it unreasonable to expect him to live with her.

36     On the alleged lack of appreciation shown to him by the Defendant, I noted that the Plaintiff did not disagree with the question that various acts from the Defendant (hugging him, telling him she loves him, cooking for him, coming up with choices of food for him) are her ways of showing care, affection and appreciation, but merely replied that that was her own way of expressing her affection[^46]. He did, however, agree that he and the Defendant have different ways of expressing care, affection and appreciation for each other, and that the different ways do not equate to the sufficiency of the affection[^47]. It bears repeating that (as stated at \[35\] above) the Plaintiff had testified that the Defendant had continued to cook for him, take of the house and the Child and did all her duties as a wife after he continued to express love for her till July, August 2018.

37     As such, based on the aforesaid, I was not convinced that the Plaintiff had proven that the Defendant had failed to show him sufficient care, affection and appreciation during the course of the marriage as alleged by him.

### The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant emotionally blackmailed and manipulated him after he had informed her of his intention to divorce her.

38     The Plaintiff cited the following four incidents in support of his allegation that the Defendant had emotionally blackmailed him and manipulated him into foregoing the divorce after he had informed her of his intention to divorce her[^48]:

> (1)     When she agreed to the divorce provided that he get her prescription sleeping pills;

> (2)     When she attempted to commit suicide on 22 December 2018 by attempting to cut her wrist;

> (3)     When she attempted to commit suicide on 23 December 2018 by attempting to hang herself; and

> (4)     When she asked the Child to confront him about his affair.

39     I should make it clear that I do not condone the Defendant’s actions as stated at \[38\] above, which I noted the Defendant did not deny. However, in my view, her overall behaviour and actions should be seen in the context of her being told by the Plaintiff that he was having an extra-marital affair, and that he intended to divorce her and abandon her and the Child, all of which would invariably have deeply hurt and affected her, such that she became emotionally unstable[^49]. I accepted the Defendant’s submission that her behaviour should be viewed from the lenses of a woman who is about to lose her marriage in which she had given everything for, and that it is not intentional behaviour of blackmail and manipulation[^50]. As such, I was not prepared to allow the Plaintiff the benefit of relying on such behaviour on the part of the Defendant to support his claim that she had behaved in such a way that he cannot reasonably be expected to live with her.

### The Plaintiff being a “highly sensitive man”

40     The Plaintiff attempted to rely on the fact that he was a “highly sensitive man” in support of his submission that any right-thinking person would come to the conclusion that the Defendant has behaved in such a way that he cannot reasonably be expected to live with her[^51].

41     To begin with, as pointed out by the Defendant[^52], the Plaintiff did not plead in his Statement of Particulars or his Reply that he was in fact a highly sensitive individual, and merely stated in his affidavit that the Defendant knew he was a highly sensitive man[^53].

42     At this juncture, I would state that the Plaintiff did not strike me as a sensitive person in the sense of being emotionally weak, vulnerable or delicate. I had the benefit of observing the Plaintiff in Court. Overall, he exhibited a calm and collected demeanour, and gave his answers in a thoughtful, even calculated, manner. I did not observe him to be intimidated or flustered under cross-examination, even when he disagreed with the questions put to him by the Defendant’s counsel. At the most, I was prepared to accept that the Plaintiff was sensitive to how he had perceived the Defendant had treated and communicated with him. I noted that the Defendant had during the trial affirmed her affidavit evidence that she felt that the Plaintiff is a sensitive man and often likes to take her comments negatively[^54].

43     However, at the same time, it was also quite clear to me that the Plaintiff had expected the Defendant to be sensitive towards him. This was borne out by the Plaintiff’s testimony in Court that since the Defendant knows he is a sensitive man and loved him, she should have known whether he had issues or problems[^55]. Yet, having earlier confirmed his affidavit evidence that he would bottle up his thoughts and feelings to avoid raising potentially sensitive topics[^56], this was, in my view, not an entirely realistic or fair expectation on the Plaintiff’s part. As such, I found the Plaintiff’s reliance on him being a “highly sensitive man” to be somewhat self-serving, and I was therefore not prepared to give weight or credence to the same.

## Conclusion

44     To conclude, I accepted the Defendant’s submission that the Plaintiff had failed to make out his case that the Defendant had behaved in such a way that he cannot reasonably be expected to live with her. In particular, I accepted the Defendant’s submission that the Defendant is not the unreasonable person the Plaintiff has made her out to be, and this was even taking into consideration the cumulative effect of her alleged behaviour. Instead, it was quite clear to me that the Plaintiff’s application for divorce was primarily motivated because he desires to marry another woman, namely one Ms \[T\] (“Ms \[T\]”). The Plaintiff’s testimony that he is in love with Ms \[T\] and is in a relationship with her, that he is renting an apartment with her at the material time (under an 18 month tenancy period based on a tenancy agreement dated 14 December 2018[^57]), and that if he does not divorce the Defendant he cannot marry another woman speaks for itself[^58].

45     For the reasons stated above, I dismissed the Writ for Divorce.

46     For costs, after hearing from parties, I decided to fix costs at $11,000.00, excluding disbursements to be agreed or taxed. I took into account the trial took two full days and two half days, with one witness and one affidavit for each side, and that parties had also prepared written submissions.
