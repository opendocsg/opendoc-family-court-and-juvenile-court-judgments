Family Law – Section 112(4) Women’s Charter

Variation of order for division of matrimonial home

4 November 2020

### District Judge Christina Koh :

1       This is an appeal by the Petitioner ex-husband (“the Husband”) against my decision relating to the amount of money that should be paid to him upon the Respondent ex-wife (“the Wife”) exercising an option to purchase his half share of their matrimonial Housing and Development Board (“HDB”) flat at Block xxx, Tah Ching Road, #xx-xx, Singapore xxxxxx (“the flat”). He consented, as indicated by his counsel, that the Wife be granted the first option to purchase his share[^1] but did not agree with the sum ordered to be paid to him.

## Introduction

2       The Parties, both Singaporeans, were divorced on 14 May 2002 under a Decree Nisi which was made absolute on 24 April 2003 when the Certificate of Making Decree Nisi Absolute was issued. An Order of Court dealing with the ancillary matters (“AM Orders”) was made on 11 March 2003 which dealt with the division of the flat and maintenance of the Wife and their child. In addition, the Wife was given sole custody of the Parties’ child with reasonable access granted to the Husband.

3       With respect to the division of the flat, the Wife was given the first option to purchase the Husband’s rights, title and interest in the flat by paying the Husband 50% of its market value less the outstanding loan; and the Husband was ordered to reimburse to his Central Provident Fund (CPF) account all monies (including interest) withdrawn for the purchase of the flat out of the sum paid to him.

## The AM Orders

4       The division of the flat is specified in Clause 2 of the AM Orders as follows:

> “…2) Division of Matrimonial Property : The Respondent to have 1st option to purchase the Petitioner’s rights, title and interest in the matrimonial flat at Block xxx, Tah Ching Road, #xx-xx, Singapore xxxxxx by paying the Petitioner 50% of the sum derived as follows: -

>> a)    Market value as determined by a HDB approved valuer less the outstanding loan; the Petitioner shall reimburse to his Central Provident Fund (CPF) account with interest all monies withdrawn for the purchase of the flat out of the 50% share paid to him as aforesaid.

>> b)    In the event that the Respondent fails to exercise the option within 3 months from the date of the decree nisi absolute the matrimonial flat shall be sold in the open market within 4 months thereafter and the nett sale proceeds after repayment of the outstanding Housing and Development Board (“HDB”) loan, deduction of the costs and expenses of sale be divided equally between the Petitioner and Respondent.

>> c)    The Petitioner and Respondent shall each reimburse to their respective CPF account all monies withdrawn for the purchase of the flat plus accrued interest from their respective shares in the nett proceeds.”

5       The flat was not sold as of 4 March 2019, some 16+ years post-divorce, and the Husband first took up a summons on that date to vary the AM Orders to deal _inter alia_ with the division of the flat. The Wife subsequently filed her cross-summons on 3 October 2019 which was amended on 14 November 2019 and further amended on 13 February 2020. On 13 February 2020, I dismissed the prayers in the Husband’s summons in relation to the division of the flat. I granted one of the prayers in the Wife’s summons partially in relation of the said division.

6       The only legal issue to be determined for the purposes of the appeal is whether I had correctly granted the prayer (in part) in the Wife’s summons which sought to vary the clause in the AM Order dealing with the Wife’s exercise of the option to buy over the Husband’s share of the flat and the amount to be paid to the Husband.

## The Wife’ Summons for Variation

7       The relevant portion of the Wife’s summons in SUM 650024/2019 (“the Wife’s Summons”) for the variation of the AM Orders which is the subject matter of this appeal is set out below.

### Prayer 3 of the Wife’s Summons

8       The following is extracted from the Wife’s Summons at Prayer 3[^2] :

> “Alternatively, that Prayer (_sic)_ 2 of the AM Order of Court be varied to state as follows :

>> 2)    Division of Matrimonial Property : The Respondent to have 1st option to purchase the Petitioner’s rights, title and interest in the matrimonial flat at Block xxx, Tah Ching Road, #xx-xx, Singapore xxxxxx at market value as determined by a HDB approved valuer less the outstanding HDB loan (nett value) by paying the Petitioner 50% of the nett value. The Petitioner (_sic_) is entitled to deduct from the Petitioner’s 50% nett value of the purchase price the following sums :

>>> (a)    the HDB housing instalment of $78,240.00 which the Respondent has paid or half of that sum or such other sum as this Honourable Court deems just;

>>> (b)    the property tax of $2,280.00 which the Respondent has paid or half that sum or such other sum as this Honourable Court deems just;

>>> (c)    the service and conservancy charges of $16,000.00 which the Respondent has paid or half that sum or such other sum as this Honourable Court deems just;

>>> (d)    in the event that the Respondent fails to exercise the option within 3 months from the date of Order to be made herein the matrimonial flat shall be sold in the open market within 4 months thereafter and 50% of the nett value of the sale proceeds after the deductions stipulated in the preceding sub-paragraphs 2(a) to 2(d) (_sic_) shall be paid to the Petitioner.

>>> (e)    The Petitioner and Respondent shall each reimburse to their respective CPF accounts all monies withdrawn for the purchase of the flat plus accrued interest from their respective shares in the nett proceeds.

## My Decision

9       On 13 February 2020, I made my orders. The relevant portions of my decision related to the Wife’s Summons in Prayer 3 is set out below :

> SUM 650024/2019 filed by the Respondent Ng Sam Moi

> Prayer 3 varied.

> Clause 2 of the AM Order of Court dated 11 March 2003 deleted and replaced as follows : “_Division of Matrimonial Property : By Consent, the Respondent to have 1st option to purchase the Petitioner’s rights, title and interest in the matrimonial flat at Block xxx Tah Ching Road #xx-xx, Singapore xxxxxx. It is ordered that the Respondent pays the Petitioner 50% of the nett value of the matrimonial flat; the nett value being the market value of the matrimonial flat as determined by a HDB approved valuer less the outstanding HDB loan, less the Respondent’s repayment of the flat’s mortgage payments of $78,240 and less the costs and expenses of sale. The Respondent is to bear the valuation fee_.”

> Clause 2(a) of the AM Order deleted and replaced as follows “_The Petitioner shall reimburse to his Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) account with interest all monies withdrawn for the purchase of the flat out of his share of the nett value_.”

> Clause 2(b) of the AM Order varied as follows : The words “_the decree nisi absolute_” replaced by “_this Order_”. The words “_and the Petitioner’s and the Respondent’s reimbursement each to their respective CPF accounts all monies withdrawn for their purchase of the flat plus accrued interest_” to be added after the words “_the deduction of the costs and expenses of sale”_ and before the words _“to be divided equally between the Petitioner and the Respondent_”. The sentence “_Both the Petitioner and Respondent are to have joint conduct of sale with a joint agent appointed with the fees shared equally_.” is to be added at the end of Clause 2(b)

> Clause 2(c) of the AM Order deleted and replaced as follows :

>> Clause 2(c)(i) The CPF Board and parties shall be at liberty to apply for further directions or orders generally.

>> Clause 2(c)(ii) This Order is made subject to the Central Provident Fund Act (Cap. 36) ("CPF Act") and the subsidiary legislation made thereunder. The CPF Board shall give effect to the terms of this order in accordance with the provisions of the CPF Act and the subsidiary legislation made thereunder.

## The AM Orders after Variation

10     For clarity, Clause 2 and its sub-clauses in the AM Orders, as varied by me, is reproduced below with the changes marked up :

> 2) Division of Matrimonial Property : ~The Respondent to have 1~st ~option to purchase the Petitioner’s rights, title and interest in the matrimonial flat at Block xxx, Tah Ching Road, #xx-xx, Singapore xxxxxx by paying the Petitioner 50% of the sum derived as follows~ : - _By Consent, the Respondent to have 1st option to purchase the Petitioner’s rights, title and interest in the matrimonial flat at Block xxx Tah Ching Road #xx-xx, Singapore xxxxxx. It is ordered that the Respondent pays the Petitioner 50% of the nett value of the matrimonial flat; the nett value being the market value of the matrimonial flat as determined by a HDB approved valuer less the outstanding HDB loan, less the Respondent’s repayment of the flat’s mortgage payments of $78,240 and less the costs and expenses of sale. The Respondent is to bear the valuation fee_.

>> a)     ~Market value as determined by a HDB approved valuer less the outstanding loan; the Petitioner shall reimburse to his Central Provident Fund (CPF) account with interest all monies withdrawn for the purchase of the flat out of the 50% share paid to him as aforesaid.~

>> _The Petitioner shall reimburse to his Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) account with interest all monies withdrawn for the purchase of the flat out of his share of the nett value._

>> b)    In the event that the Respondent fails to exercise the option within 3 months from the date of ~the decree nisi absolute~ this Order the matrimonial flat shall be sold in the open market within 4 months thereafter and the nett sale proceeds after repayment of the outstanding Housing and Development Board (“HDB”) loan, deduction of the costs and expenses of sale _and the Petitioner’s and the Respondent’s reimbursement each to their respective CPF accounts all monies withdrawn for their purchase of the flat plus accrued interest_ be divided equally between the Petitioner and Respondent. _Both the Petitioner and Respondent are to have joint conduct of sale with a joint agent appointed with the fees shared equally_.

>> ~c)The Petitioner and Respondent shall each reimburse to their respective CPF account all monies withdrawn for the purchase of the flat plus accrued interest from their respective shares in the nett proceeds~

>>> c)(i)   _The CPF Board and parties shall be at liberty to apply for further directions or orders generally._

>>> c)(ii)   _This Order is made subject to the Central Provident Fund Act (Cap. 36) ("CPF Act") and the subsidiary legislation made thereunder. The CPF Board shall give effect to the terms of this order in accordance with the provisions of the CPF Act and the subsidiary legislation made thereunder._

## The Appeal

11     The Husband filed a Notice of Appeal against that part of my decision for the Wife’s Summons which varied Clause 2 of the AM Orders ie “Prayer 3 varied. Clause 2 of the AM Order of Court dated 11 March 2003 deleted and replaced as follows: “_Division of Matrimonial Property: By Consent, the Respondent to have 1st option to purchase the Petitioner's rights, title and interest in the matrimonial flat at Blk xxx Tah Ching Road #xx-xx Singapore xxxxxx. It is ordered that the Respondent pays the Petitioner 50% of the nett value of the matrimonial flat; the nett value being the market value of the matrimonial flat as determined by a HDB approved valuer less the outstanding HDB loan, less the Respondent's repayment of the flat's mortgage payments of $78,240 and less the costs and expenses of sale. The Respondent is to bear the valuation fee_".

## The Issue

12     As stated earlier, there is only one issue in this case. The sole issue is whether Clause 2 of the AM Order could rightly be varied by me by allowing the following two deductions by the Wife (if she exercises the option to buy over the Husband’s half share of the flat) on top of the deduction of the outstanding HDB loan from the valuation price of the flat _viz_ :

> (a)     $78,240 in mortgage payments made by the Wife and

> (b)     the costs and expenses of sale.

13     At this juncture, it would be useful to set out the background facts to understand how the amount of $78,240 was derived as the Wife’s payment towards the HDB mortgage for the flat.

## Background Facts

14     The flat is a 5 room flat purchased by the Parties sometime in 1996 for the sum of $142,900[^3]. The loan instalment is $489 per month[^4]. Prior to the AM Order, the Husband paid the said instalments but the Wife does not have the records when he stopped paying. Although she started to pay the housing loan after he stopped doing so when his "CPF savings ‘dried up’ ”, she cannot recall when this happened[^5].

15     The flat remained undisposed since the AM Orders. The Wife and the son of the Parties’ marriage have continued staying there to present date. The Husband has been living in China since 1999. He has since remarried.

16     The Wife exhibited HDB reminders for arrears of the loan instalments stretching as far back as 21 October 2006 which she settled[^6]. She made payment through her CPF account and through cash payments where the CPF deduction was insufficient[^7]. She exhibited records of her CPF payments for the HDB loan for the flat[^8] as well as HDB records of payment from January 2012 to June 2019[^9].

17     She initially estimated (in her affidavit filed on 26 November 2019) that from 1 October 2006 to 26 November 2019, she had made a total of $77,200 (rounded up from $77,196.80) in mortgage payments[^10]. As of 5 June 2019, the loan balance was $9,833.46[^11]. In her latest affidavit filed on 10 February 2020, she stated that she had made another two more mortgage payments and that the correct figure for the total housing instalments paid by her was $78,240. The payments were made partly through her CPF account and partly through cash as follows :

>   
| 

1 Oct 2006 to 31 Dec 2006

 | 

3 months x $489 ($1,467)

 |
| 

1 Jan 2007 to 31 Dec 2018

 | 

144 months x $489 ($70,416)

 |
| 

1 Jan 2019 to 31 Jan 2020

 | 

13 months x $489 ($6,357)

 |
| 

Total HDB housing instalments paid **$78,240[^12]**

 |

  
  

18     In his affidavit filed on 4 March 2019, the Husband claimed that to the best of his recollection, the Respondent took over the payment of the housing loan for the past 6 years ie. from 2013[^13]. However, his own CPF documents belie this. From a perusal of his CPF Yearly Statements of Account, the earliest one starting from 1 January 2010, the documents show that no home loan instalments were paid by him at least from 1 January 2010[^14].

19     The Wife has stated that at all material times, the flat will continue to remain as home for herself and her son; and that there is no question of it being sold to third parties[^15].

20     It is clear that from the time of its purchase (in 1996 for the sum of $142,900) to recent times, the flat has more than tripled in value. Resale flat prices exhibited by the Husband in his affidavit filed on 4 March 2019 showed that a similar 5 room flat (at the same road and vicinity, of about the same lease commencement and located at about the same floor as the flat) was transacted at a sale price of $492,000 in September 2018[^16].

## Section 112(4) of the Women’s Charter

21     The Court’s power to vary an order made on the division of a matrimonial asset is found in section 112(4) of the Women’s Charter which states :

> _The court may, at any time it thinks fit, extend, vary, revoke or discharge any order made under this section, and may vary any term or condition upon or subject to which any such order has been made._

### Case Law on Variation of Orders for the Division of Matrimonial Assets

22     The Court of Appeal in **_AYM v AYL_** <span class="citation">\[2013\] 1 SLR 924</span> (“**_AYM v AYL_**”) prescribed the limits to the court’s power to vary an order for the division of matrimonial assets which has already been made. This is because the statutory language utilised in section 112(4) of the Women’s Charter is very broad and the section is only intended to confer upon the court a limited or administrative flexibility to adjust an order for such a division so long as the order it has made has not been completely effected or implemented (see **_AYM v AYL_** at \[22\]).

23     It was set out in **_AYM v AYL_** at \[23\] the situations when the Court could make the necessary variations to an order for the division of matrimonial assets. It was held by the Court of Appeal that even assuming that the order for such a division made by the court has not been completely effected or implemented, a variation could only be made to the order only where the said order was unworkable or has become unworkable (but before it has been fully effected or implemented).

24     It was further clarified by the Court of Appeal in **_AYM v AYL_** at \[25\] that where new circumstances have emerged since the order was made which so radically change the situation so that to implement the order as originally made would be to implement something radically different from what was originally intended, this would amount to unworkability; and the court could make the necessary variations to deal with such unworkability.

### Application of the law to the facts

25     The original Clause 2(b) of the AM Orders is now unworkable due to the passage of time. The order cannot be implemented as the time period for the Wife to exercise her option to purchase the Husband’s share of the flat (ie. within 3 months of the decree nisi absolute) or for the flat to be sold in the open market should the Wife not exercise the said option (ie. within 7 months of the decree nisi absolute) has long gone by. The order remains unimplemented.

26     Hence, due to the unworkability of the order in Clause 2(b), it was necessary to vary this sub-clause and I did so. Using my power under s112(4) of the Women’s Charter, I changed the cut-off date for the Wife to exercise the option to 3 months from the date of my order on 13 February 2020. I also pegged a failure to exercise the option, upon which the flat is to be sold in the open market, to a date 7 months after the date of my order. It is appropriate to point out here that since an appeal has been filed against my order, further variations may have to be made to my order as those dates have now expired.

27     I accept that the Wife has been paying for the flat’s loan instalments since October 2006. By doing so, she has preserved the flat’s value and it is through her continued payments that both Parties have each made substantial capital gains on the flat since it has more than tripled its original value from the time of its purchase. In addition, by paying for the monthly housing payments since late 2006, the loan for the flat has correspondingly decreased which increases the nett value of the flat.

28     At the time of the AM Orders, the flat would not have had the same market value as today and the Wife would not have to stump up as much finances that she will have to do now, in order to buy over the Husband’s share, had she exercised the option to purchase his share then. Some 17 over years has passed since the AM Orders were made.

29     Although deducting the housing instalments of $78,240 (which she had made from October 2006 to January 2020) from the amount she is to pay the Husband will reduce the amount that he will receive (as opposed to the flat being sold in the open market), I find that that is nevertheless just and equitable to order that the Wife be allowed to set off _inter alia_ the sum of $78,240 from his share of the nett value of the flat.

30     In addition, I am of the opinion that the immense increase in the value of the flat is a new circumstance which has emerged since the AM orders were made. This has greatly changed the situation so that to implement those orders as originally made would be to implement something radically different from what was originally intended, rendering the original order unworkable. This is because it was intended by the District Judge who made the AM Orders that the Wife would have first option to purchase the Husband’s share of the flat.

31     The Wife still wishes to exercise that option and hence the original intention in the AM Orders should be preserved. However, with the current high value of the flat, the Wife may be hard pressed to obtain the necessary increased finances to buy over the Husband’s share which would now be far more than what was envisaged at the time of the AM Orders.

32     The Husband’s counsel pointed out that the Wife’s “reimbursement claim of housing instalment paid…goes again the grain of logic as Wife will receive her CPF monies when and if the flat is sold in the open market. In the event, Wife retains the flat, monies expanded (_sic_) towards payment of the housing loan goes towards her acquisition of an asset”[^17].

33     It is undisputed that the Husband will stand to gain a windfall for himself either when the flat is sold in the open market or when the Wife buys over his share.

34     By paying down the housing loan each month; the loan quantum has steadily decreased. This would result in a higher sum to the Husband when the Wife takes over his share or if the flat is transacted in the open market.

35     I have accepted that the Wife had continued paying the $489 monthly instalment until at least 31 January 2020. The loan sum which stood at $9,833.46 as of 5 June 2019 (some 8 months before the decision of 13 February 2020), would have been $3,912 less as at 31 January 2020. By today, assuming that the monthly payments have been kept up by the Wife (and there is no reason to so doubt), the HDB mortgage loan would be almost completely paid off.

36     The Wife has expressed that she wishes to take over the flat and will continue to use the flat as a home for herself and her son. I accept that the Wife would not be selling the flat to third parties and she will not be cashing in on the extra deduction of $78,240 allowed by my order.

37     In order to give effect to the intent of the AM Orders that the Wife be given the first option to buy over the Husband’s share of the flat, I ordered that the Wife be entitled to deduct the sum of $78,240 (in addition to the costs and expenses of the sale) from the Husband’s share of the nett value of the flat. This would place her in a viable position to actually take over his share since both are in agreement that she may do so. I thus varied Clause 2 of the AM Orders to make it workable.

38     It should be highlighted here that although I allowed the sum of $78,240 and the costs and expenses of the sale to be deducted from the sum that the Wife should pay the Husband for taking over his share of the flat, I did not allow her prayers for the deduction for property tax of $2,280.00 and the deduction of the service and conservancy charges of $16,000.00 paid by her as these are necessary outgoings which she needed to pay to continue to stay in the flat. I have also taken into account her exclusive occupation of the flat in deciding not to allow these two deductions.

## Conclusion

39     As the clause allowing the Wife to exercise the first option to purchase the Husband’s rights, title and interest in the flat has become unworkable due to the huge increase in the value of the flat, I therefore varied the relevant clause in the AM orders to allow a $78,240 deduction when she exercises the option to purchase the Husband’s share.

40     It is also entirely congruent with the concept of fairness that the Wife is entitled to set off this amount (in addition to the costs and expenses of the Husband’s sale of his share of the flat to her) against the 50% nett value of the flat which the Husband will eventually receive when she exercises the option to purchase his share.
