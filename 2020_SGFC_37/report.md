lasting power of attorney – removing a donee – conflicting medical opinion on mental capacity – validity of power of attorney and statutory declaration of patient with cognitive impairment – access to a patient

9 April 2020

### District Judge Shobha G. Nair:

1       Parties to this dispute are sisters. Their father (P) has been in the business of providing a range of funeral services for well over 40 years and is the sole proprietor of ‘L’ Funeral Parlour (LFP) which rents out its funeral parlours to the families of deceased persons. The plaintiff by her own admission had not been involved in P’s business prior to this dispute and works in an unrelated capacity in another organisation. The defendant and her family lives in Hong Kong and had for a long time prior to this dispute, been helping her father out in the latter’s various business efforts**[^1]** including the running of a business styled ‘M’ Funeral Services Pte Ltd (M) which provided a wide variety of funeral services. In 2006, P made the defendant a director of ‘M’.

2       P suffered a stroke in 2000. He recovered well and retained mental capacity to continue making decisions with respect to his personal welfare and property and affairs. This was not disputed. On 15 June 2017, a Lasting Power of Attorney was executed by P appointing his daughters as donees of power and they were to act jointly and severally in all decisions relating to the personal welfare and property and affairs of P should he lose his mental capacity to do so. The validity of the LPA was not disputed. Unfortunately, on 29 July 2017, P suffered a second stroke, this time leaving him with significant cognitive impairment. The defendant acknowledging that her father had no mental capacity to manage his property and affairs, sent to the plaintiff a draft deed on 24 August 2018 seeking that the latter agree to a transfer of 30% of the ownership of LFP to the defendant. The plaintiff, somewhat perplexed by the request, pointed to the duties of a donee of power under the LPA and declined the request. On 18 February 2019, the defendant brought P to a law office to sign a Power of Attorney (POA) and a Statutory Declaration (SD) enabling the transfer of his interests in LFP to the defendant, the conversion of LFP to a private limited company (LFPPL) and the appointment of the defendant as the director and sole shareholder of LFPPL. The plaintiff was not informed of this and was expectedly shocked to find out that LFPPL was incorporated by the defendant on 19 February 2019. The plaintiff proceeded to take out the current application and sought by way of an ex parte application, an injunction to stop, _inter alia_, the defendant from engaging in business under the name of LFPPL and using any monies from P’s bank accounts. An interim injunction was ordered on 21 March 2019.

3       In OSM 103/2019, the plaintiff essentially sought the removal of the defendant as a donee of power under the LPA and for the plaintiff to act solely with regards to all matters relating to the personal welfare and property and affairs of P pursuant to the LPA. In the course of the hearing, the defendant did suggest that she would be willing to work with the plaintiff jointly. This was declined by the plaintiff. The plaintiff also sought via summons 2429/2020, the conversion of LFPPL to a sole proprietorship and the return of the status of P as the sole proprietor of the business. The defendant contested the application vigorously. She was insistent on retaining the business as a private limited company and sought to provide evidence of the position that this was advantageous to the business. She was of the view that the execution of the POA and the SD were valid.

4       While both parties were largely in agreement that P did not have sufficient mental capacity to manage his personal welfare and property and affairs _generally_, the defendant took the position that medical opinion showed that P had the mental capacity to decide on the specific issue of who he had wanted to take charge of the running of his business. She claimed that the execution of the POA and the SD were documents which validly expressed P’s desire for the defendant to be at the forefront of the business and all decisions that needed to be made to advance the business interests of P.

5       Having heard the parties and their witnesses, all of whom were cross-examined given the apparent conflict in positions on key areas, including medical opinion, I issued the following orders:

> (a)     LFP shall be reinstated as a live entity and operated as a sole proprietorship. The parties shall take all steps necessary to enable this with immediate effect. The Power of Attorney and Statutory Declaration dated 18 February 2019 are deemed invalid and shall cease to be of legal effect.

> (b)     The LPA shall remain in force save as provided in this Order.

> (c)     In areas relating to the management of the business of P, the parties shall work together and each shall be at liberty to make decisions which are aimed at furthering the interests of the business provided the other is kept informed and written consent obtained. In the event parties are unable to reach agreement on any aspect of the management of the business, the plaintiff shall be entrusted with the decision.

> (d)     The Office of the Public Guardian is to investigate into monies withdrawn by the defendant in the course of assisting in the funeral business to meet personal expenses, including gifts of any kind. Any monies utilised for personal expenses or to provide gifts are to be fully refunded to P within a month of the OPG’s position being made known.

> (e)     A professional auditor shall be newly appointed by the parties and if they are unable to agree on the appointment, then by the plaintiff, to ensure that proper accounting practices are employed and observed in the running of the business during the lifetime of P from the time the business is restored as a sole proprietorship.

> (f)     The interim injunction shall be discharged once the business is reinstated as a sole proprietorship.

> (g)     All bank accounts into which monies due and payable to P, including rental income from residential properties shall be kept separate and distinct from accounts into which monies belonging to the plaintiff and the defendant are retained. Any withdrawals from accounts into which P’s money is placed shall be made for the sole purpose of meeting P and his wife’s expenses and such withdrawals shall only be made by the plaintiff. Quarterly reports shall be provided to the defendant.

> (h)     For the avoidance of doubt, the defendant shall be allowed to continue having access to her father when the former is in Singapore.

> (i)     For the avoidance of doubt, the spouses of the plaintiff and defendant shall not engage in any aspect of the management of the funeral business of P nor his property and affairs generally.

6       Save for order (a) above, the plaintiff is dissatisfied with the remaining orders and appeals against the same. I had issued written observations and findings before issuing the orders above and this is reproduced below for ease of reference:

> “_This case illustrates how laws set up to enable an adult child to care for an aged parent who has lost his autonomy to decide matters pertaining to his personal welfare and assets – are often interpreted in ways which are in truth, designed to preserve the wealth of a parent ---for the child---and ancillary to that, to ensure that the parent is generally cared for. In many cases, this being no exception, an application under the Mental Capacity Act is misunderstood and looked at in much the same vein as a succession or inheritance matter – whether consciously or otherwise. The child sees no concern arising from using one parent’s money to meet varied financial concerns unrelated to the care and welfare of the parent so long as the parent is also catered for. I use this opportunity to emphasise that the relevant laws are designed to protect the vulnerable patient. No one expects nor it is hoped, desires one’s parent to be unable to decide for himself where he should live or how his money should be spent. The need to preserve the assets of the parent, enhance its value where possible and to use it for his care is crucial. The situation with regards his autonomy, having changed on account of illness or injury, necessarily means that old ways of spending have to similarly change so that the patient is cared for. A donee of power needs to prioritise the interests of the person he cares for. It is not ancillary to other priorities._

> _Although there was much time spent on debating the state of P’s mental capacity – a lack of which necessitates an order of court and conversely, the presence of which does not require any orders, the doctors were largely consistent. P lacked/lacks the required mental capacity to make decisions relating to his personal welfare and property and affairs. The question centred on whether Dr ‘E’ and Dr ‘F’ were correct in their position that P had expressed that he wanted the defendant to manage the business. Dr ‘G’ called by the plaintiff, had opined that it would be difficult to draw that conclusion given that severe deficits were shown in his assessment of the capacity of P even if that question was not specifically posed by him to P._

> _None of the medical professionals stated that it was the intention of P to have his business entity altered or for it to be taken over by either of his children. The limited issue where there was divergence was who was to manage the business. What I found to be of concern was the amount of preparation by the defendant of P for the assessments. While I took note of Dr ‘E’’s statement that any preparation would not have played in the mind of P given that he would not have been able to retain it for too long, we do know from the transcripts that lengthy efforts at coaching P on what to say was seen as necessary by the defendant suggesting that this may well have continued to the time before P stepped into the doctor’s office. Even if this were an unsafe assumption to make, I find it difficult to appreciate the need for the defendant to repeat in a laborious and often times disturbing way, what her father should say to the doctors. If it is Dr ‘E’ and Dr ‘F’s position that ‘P’ may be able to express himself based on memory of events and circumstances that happened in the distant past and not recent times, it would be entirely possible that any deep seated intentions for the defendant to manage the business, if accurate, would be based on recollection of events in the distant past when the defendant was in fact entrusted with many aspects of running related businesses. All the medical evidence including the report by Dr ‘H’ speak of P as a man generally unable to provide clear direction on matters relating to property and his financial affairs. On the limited issue of who is to manage the funeral parlour business, it would be important to set the evidence of Dr ‘E’ and Dr ‘F’ in the context of what is clearly unnecessary pressure placed on P by the defendant to articulate a stand and the extrinsic evidence of P’s “deep seated desire”. I accept that the defendant, having been the one who involved herself in the father’s business ventures could well be P’s choice or one of his choices – not because she was necessarily trustworthy or more able – but because she was involved in the past and knew the business better. But the position he was in today – terribly vulnerable – being told repeatedly what he should say – afraid of losing either or both of his daughters, his grandchildren and his sense of family at a time he needed it most – makes any expression of intention at a time when capacity generally was demonstrably lacking – extremely unsafe to accept._

> _The defendant had taken numerous steps which clearly indicate that while she was intending to ensure that the needs of her father are catered for, an ancillary purpose was also being served. The defendant saw the business as hers – eventually – despite her acceptance of the validity of the LPA and the will which clearly reflect P’s preference to have both his children united in the administration of his estate. Since the defendant assisted her father substantively, she felt entitled to take on a larger role at this time – without the need to even inform the plaintiff. I did not doubt that P and his wife would be catered for in a satisfactory manner. The role of the donee of powers under the LPA however is not to manage P’s affairs in a way that met different objectives. The acts leading to the execution of the power of attorney and the conversion of the business entity speak of entitlement and not responsibility. The attempts at returning monies taken and of providing documentation were clearly acts in response to legal proceedings and had little to do with the sincerity called of a donee of powers under the LPA. The act of converting the business without even informing the plaintiff speaks of disregard and unilateral decision-making._

> _P by his actions clearly showed that he loved his children. He allowed for the strengths of each to flourish in different areas. The defendant did engage herself in the business more than the plaintiff. The plaintiff pursued a different vocation. Both are successful in their own spheres of work. The one who looked after the business is not however the one who ought to take it over unless it was the will of her father. Her assistance was both a privilege and a responsibility. Her involvement in itself gives no entitlement to unilateral decision-making when the source of the wealth is no longer able to guide and decide the direction of the business. P himself may not have anticipated that his daughters would be in disagreement over the manner in which the business is to be run. Clearly he expected a united front. This can be garnered from the terms of the LPA and the will. The defendant accepted the terms of the will. Nothing in the will seeks to preserve the business for one or both of the children to take over. At this time, P would have wanted the business to continue but not for it to be continued at the expense of his own interest. The fact that the defendant views his interest to be aligned to hers – the fact that she believes she can manage monies in a way which supports her expenses – would be a wrong reading of the facts and would be dangerous to the preservation of P’s interests. At the end of the day, it must be P’s interests that this Court is obliged to safeguard._

> _On the issue of who is best equipped to manage the business, it appears that the business has been able to run relatively well with experienced staff and supervision by the daughters even without being physically present for most part of each day. The plaintiff has a full-time job and the defendant lives in Hong Kong. The success of a business depends on a variety of factors and I would not place failure in one venture to be a sign of inability in another nor experience to be crucial. The long standing name and goodwill of P’s business remains. With good staff and honest leadership, it is likely that this will continue to generate income for P and his wife.”_

7       The orders made were significantly in favour of the plaintiff in relation to the management of P’s business and this also appears to be the position of plaintiff’s counsel in submissions on costs.**[^2]** The written observations detailed in the preceding paragraph provide the main platforms for the decision(s) in favour of the plaintiff. It appears that the plaintiff is dissatisfied with aspects of those orders which enable a “coming-together” of the sisters in the management of their father’s financial affairs generally, i.e., beyond matters relating to LFP as well as continued accountability to the defendant with regards the management of LFP should the plaintiff need to act unilaterally on any matter pertaining to LFP. The plaintiff had maintained throughout the hearing that the defendant was untrustworthy and should effectively be prevented from making any decision for P and even from unsupervised access to P, unless it was conducted in the presence of the plaintiff. I shall limit these grounds of decision to address my findings as it relates to the scope of this appeal.

## The retention of donee powers under the LPA

8       The LPA was validly executed by P. He intended for his daughters to attend to all matters relating to his personal welfare and property and affairs jointly and severally should he become mentally incapacitated, save for the disposal of his property by making gifts of cash.[^3]

9       A court may revoke the appointment of the defendant as a donee under the LPA if it is satisfied that the donee “engages or has engaged” in conduct that contravenes the donee’s authority or which is not in the donor’s best interests and the donor lacks capacity to revoke his own LPA.[^4] Section 17(5) of the MCA states that if there is more than one donee, the court may under subsection (4)(b)[^5] revoke the LPA in respect of all or such of the matters to which the LPA relates as the Court thinks fit, so far as it relates to any of the donees_._

10     I was of the view that the execution of the power of attorney and P’s statutory declaration on 18 February 2018 at a time when P’s mental capacity was impaired was designed to secure the defendant’s interests in P’s business especially because the plaintiff was not prepared, and rightly so, to accede to the defendant’s request to own 30% per cent of P’s business. The extremely thin line the defendant sought to draw between P’s lack of mental capacity generally and his ability to specifically comment on who he wanted to run his business and make decisions with respect to that, was an exercise in futility. The doctors were consistent on the question of P’s lack of mental capacity to make decisions generally and his inability to articulate the type of business entity he had wanted his business to continue as. The LPA made explicit that the daughters were to act jointly and severally with respect to all matters relating to the personal welfare and property and affairs of P in the event P did not have the mental capacity to handle these himself. I accepted the evidence of the plaintiff that there was no real difference between supervision of the business and management of the business as the day-to-day operations were always left to the staff of the business.[^6] There was nothing in evidence which showed that he wanted the plaintiff or the defendant to take over the business and certainly nothing which showed that the type of business entity could be changed by either one of them.

11     The powers of the defendant under the LPA were still preserved while certain powers of the defendant in the business arena were modified to ensure that P’s interests in LFP would not be further compromised. I allowed the sisters to manage the business together within new parameters. This involved giving the plaintiff the authority to make unilateral decisions if parties were not able to agree on certain business related matters. In other words, I did not close the door on the sisters working together in the business space but placed a stopper to it which could be removed by the plaintiff if the needs of P required it. I kept the door wide open in relation to all matters beyond the sphere of P’s business as the defendant had always attended to the personal welfare of P and his wife jointly with the plaintiff and was very active in the management of P’s assets in the past including the sale and rental of investment properties.[^7]

12     The conduct of the defendant in changing the type of P’s business entity, claiming ownership of the same and in refusing to account for monies spent which allegedly belonged to P - while egregious, needs to be seen in the context of the history of the working relationship between P and the defendant and the intentions of P when he had the capacity to express them.

13     The LPA was issued in the not too distant past (June 2017) and could appropriately be considered as a true and relevant reflection of P’s desire. While considering what is in the best interests of the donor is an assessment the Court needs to make rather than to come to a conclusion on what the donor would have done if he had testamentary capacity,[^8] it remains relevant that P did not choose to revoke the LPA issued in 2017 before suffering his second stroke. The evidence showed that he loved his daughters and perhaps more importantly to them, equally. The plaintiff and defendant confirmed that they shared a very good relationship as they grew from young children through adolescence and into adulthood.[^9] They are both in their fifties and do not have a history of conflict. It was the defendant’s recent attempt to take over the business when P was mentally incapacitated that threw the siblings into the throes of conflict.

14     It appeared to me during cross-examination that the defendant was very anxious about the possibility of losing her livelihood. Prior to migrating to Hong Kong, she had been deeply involved in the running of her father’s business to the exclusion of P. She relies on the business thriving today to support her young family and made the grave mistake of feeling entitled to it. It was not disputed that the plaintiff was not involved in the business in any way. Even today, she relies on staff of the business to run the operations as she continues her own work. The defendant on the other hand, has a wealth of experience in the funeral business although her involvement is rather more limited today given that she migrated to Hong Kong in 2015. The evidence did show frequent trips to Singapore in 2017 and 2018 however, during which time, she lived with her parents in their home, a home the defendant co-owns.

15     Many of the workers of LFP gave evidence and took partisan positions on who they thought was better at running the business. The reality was that the day-to-day operations was left largely in the hands of the staff of LFP and in particular, a lady named ‘J’. They were able workers and both P’s daughters appear to trust them. There was however, no proper accounting practices in place, with cash from customers being passed to the defendant by the staff (and more recently, the plaintiff), who would then pay towards business expenses and the needs of her parents. There was in the past, an incident of misappropriation of monies by a member of the staff and the real possibility of this continuing was acknowledged by the bookkeeper of LFP, ‘K’.[^10] It would be prudent to look to both daughters to continue oversight of the business and ensure that the profits made are properly channelled for the growth of the business and the personal expenses of P and his wife who is unfortunately also of poor health. As regards who best to leave the management of the business to, I was of the view that while the defendant had the skills to do so, she was not always available given her residency in Hong Kong. On the other hand, the plaintiff while not having comparable skills (which may not be significant given the nature of the business and the presence of able staff), nor time for the business, was trustworthy and would be able to be a good check on the staff while tapping on the expertise of her sister, if needed. I was of the view that I should be slow to revoke the powers of a donee altogether where conduct which is inappropriate related to one aspect of financial affairs and could be seen as a desperate attempt to secure her interests, having been the only family member who was involved in P’s business prior to her father’s incapacity. Even if the fact of ‘M’ ceasing business under the charge of the defendant caused unhappiness on the part of P, he did not limit in any significant way, the ability of the defendant to help out in LFP. In fact there was no clear evidence of the fact that ‘M’ failed because of the defendant’s poor management.[^11] The evidence does point to a good relationship between P and both daughters lending itself to the probability that P would likely not have revoked the LPA if he had the capacity to do so. This consistent desire for his daughters to be treated equally can also be seen in the provisions of P’s 2014 will which both daughters accept as a valid expression of their father’s intentions. He executed a will leaving his entire estate to his wife and after her passing, to his daughters in equal shares. There is no mention of the business continuing under any particular person or form.

16     The property and affairs of a mentally incapacitated person relates to all aspects of financial life of P. It is only in the arena of business management that I saw a need to carve out certain parameters as this was the arena that the dispute arose. The rental of P’s properties for example was not an area where the daughters were in dispute. The appointment of a professional auditor to ensure proper accounting was observed at LFP was imperative given the way money transactions were being handled in P’s absence. While the parties were allowed to appoint an auditor jointly, I left it to the plaintiff should they not be in agreement on the individual to be appointed. Similarly, with regards decision-making for the business, they are to continue acting jointly but the plaintiff was given the prerogative to make decisions unilaterally so long as it is in the interests of the business to do so and consent by the defendant was unreasonably withheld.

## The return of monies and the engagement of the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG)

17     One of the allegations of the plaintiff was that monies belonging to P was on numerous occasions used by the defendant to meet her own expenses and to provide gifts to third persons. Donees under a LPA work in a fiduciary setting and must never take advantage of their position to benefit themselves.[^12] Numerous requests to account for the monies had fallen on deaf ears and the OPG was alerted to the defendant’s alleged misdeeds sometime in February 2019. The evidence raised concerns about the expenditure of the defendant and warranted further investigations. Any monies belonging to P which was inappropriately utilised by the defendant ought to be returned into the account of P. The appropriate body to look into this would be the OPG and the direction was made accordingly. The counsel for the plaintiff was to serve the order on the OPG for this exercise to take place and if any monies are to be returned, it would need to be done within a month of the notification by the OPG. The nature of the appeal against this part of the order is not clear as it was the plaintiff’s counsel’s position that “_the gravitas of the defendant’s breaches necessitates a thorough investigation to be conducted by the OPG_”.[^13] I agreed that it would be important for the OPG to look into the aspect of monies withdrawn and used for purposes which do not advance the interests of P.

## The separation of business monies from personal funds

18     Paragraph 29 of the plaintiff’s first affidavit of 15 March 2019 details the bank accounts which P holds in his name or jointly with either the plaintiff or the defendant. The order which calls for the parties to maintain their own funds in separate accounts was to signal the need to retain monies belonging to P in P’s accounts and allowing the plaintiff to utilise monies for P and her mother’s expenses so as to avoid any future disagreement on how those monies were spent.

## The discharge of the injunction

19     Given the orders taken in its totality, the injunction issued in March 2019 would need to be lifted upon the reinstatement of the business as a sole proprietorship.

## The continued contact between P and the defendant

20     It begs repeating that the nature of donee powers is to facilitate decisions with regards the personal welfare and property and affairs of a donor who has lost his mental capacity to do so. It is not to restrict the defendant’s access to P. It was the plaintiff’s position that the defendant would harass P if she were to visit him without the plaintiff’s presence. The defendant did indeed show unbridled insistence on having P express that he wanted her to take over his business. With orders in place however, restricting the defendant’s unilateral involvement in the business moving forward, it would be draconian to limit the access of a daughter who lives overseas, to her father, when she came to Singapore. Evidence pointed to a normal father-child relationship prior to the case and ordering supervision of the defendant during times of access, after the case, is akin to treating the defendant on the same level as an abuser visiting a vulnerable victim. The plaintiff saw that to be the truth. I did not share this view. If anything, visits by the defendant would at times mean visits by the grandchildren. Something P looks forward to. In addition, the defendant is a co-owner of the property lived in by her parents and to place limitations to free access to one’s own home is unduly harsh.

## The involvement of the spouses of parties.

21     There was some reference to the negative involvement of the spouses of the parties. In light of the fact that P had looked to his daughters when it came to his welfare and financial affairs and did not appoint their spouses during his time of capacity, to any significant nor lasting role in the business, I felt it prudent to direct categorically that the spouses were not to involve themselves in the running of the business. This would only complicate the dynamics between the sisters. I say no more on this issue.

## Conclusion

22     The orders were designed to reflect as closely as possible the intentions of the donor under the LPA, a document which was executed relatively recently. The poor judgment of the defendant in relation to the business of P required a restriction of her powers in this sphere. It ought not to extend beyond that as she was heavily involved in the personal welfare of both parents, including the management of the helpers and the liasing necessary for therapeutic services for P. She had in the past assisted P in selling off investment properties from which both daughters benefited equally. She is also the co-owner of two properties with P.[^14] Her failings in one area do not automatically signal the certain failing in other areas. Additionally, the fact that the sisters enjoyed a healthy relationship before this matter arose is hope that it can be restored and I would encourage the same. While I appreciate that the court should not live under any delusion that parties can feel a sudden change to their emotions, I urge them to consider the feelings of P at this time. He had always treated them well and it would be of great value to him to know that they are treating each other the same way – even if he may no longer be able to articulate this. Perhaps, because of that.
