Family Law – Access – children

Family Law – Matrimonial Assets – Division – Maintenance – children

30 August 2019

### District Judge Wong Keen Onn:

## Introduction

1       The Plaintiff (husband) has appealed against part of the decision[^1] on ancillary relief regarding the children’s access and maintenance and on the part of division of matrimonial assets.

## Background

2       The Plaintiff (or “husband”) and the Defendant (or “wife”) were married on 6 April 2002. The Plaintiff husband is an Australian national and a Singapore Permanent Resident, aged 41 years old, and he had just attained qualifications as a trained teacher[^2]. The Defendant wife is a Singapore citizen, 40 years of age, and is a risk manager drawing a monthly take home income of $21,490 (including bonus)[^3]. They have two sons, B, aged 14 years and C, aged 12[^4].

3       During the marriage, the parties lived at various times at various places in Singapore and Australia. Sometime in July 2010, the parties and the children moved to live in husband’s hometown in Queensland, Australia where they set up a café and furniture shop. The business venture was not successful. The wife could not find an IT job in Australia. Subsequently, on 30 January 2012, she came back to take up a job with her previous employer in Singapore, leaving the children with the husband for about 4 months[^5]. In early August 2012, the wife and children relocated back to Singapore. In the same month, the husband also returned back to Singapore. About two years later in June 2014, the husband left the family in Singapore and went alone to live in Australia[^6].

4       In August 2015, a dispute broke out between the parties resulting in the breakdown of their marriage[^7]. On 21 June 2016, the husband filed for divorce based on the wife’s unreasonable behaviour. In response, the wife filed a defence and counterclaim on unreasonable behaviour[^8]. Interim Judgment was granted on 27 December 2016 on an uncontested basis to both the husband’s claim and the wife’s counterclaim. The ancillary matters were adjourned to Chambers. This is a 14-year marriage with two children. The husband now lives in in Australia with a lived-in partner, with whom he has a 1-year-old child.

## The Ancillary Order

5       The ancillary matters came before me for hearing. After reading the affidavits and hearing the evidence and the submissions from both counsel[^9], I made the ancillary order on 12 November 2018 as follows:

> Custody, care and control and access.

> (1)     By Consent, the Plaintiff and the Defendant shall have joint custody of the two children of the marriage, namely, B (B/C No. XXX) ("**B**") and C, (B/C No. XXX) ("**C**") (both also referred to as "**the children**") with care and control to the Defendant

> (2)     The Plaintiff husband shall have reasonable access to the two children B and C as follows.

>> (a)       Reasonable telephone and other internet / electronic access (including Skype and WhatsApp) to the children, at all other times subject to the children's school and school-related activities.

The precise dates and handover arrangements/place and timings are to be mutually discussed and agreed between the parties at least two weeks in advance, taking into consideration the children's school and school-related activities

>>> (iii)       In the event that either party wishes to have a longer period with the children during school holidays, such variation shall be mutually agreed upon in writing two (2) weeks in advance before the dates that each party intends to spend with the children.

>>> (iv)       Plaintiff is at liberty to bring the children to Australia or another country during the school holiday access and shall bear both the full costs of the two-way air travel or ship travel expenses and surcharges and any excess baggage fees to and from Singapore and the accommodation costs outside Singapore, if any. The Plaintiff shall provide to the Defendant one (1) week before the trip a copy of the two-way flight or ship/cruise tickets, the full itinerary for the trip including accommodation details and the contact details for the children

>> (d)       The Defendant shall have reasonable telephone and other internet access to the children when they are residing with the Plaintiff and the Plaintiff shall make arrangements to facilitate this

>>> (ii)       School report card and examination/test results and examination timetables

> Division of matrimonial assets

> (3)     The Plaintiff shall transfer his share, title and interest in the property known as XX1, Australia _("XX1 property")_ to the Defendant upon the payment of SGD $27,233.00 from the Defendant to the Plaintiff within three months of the date of this Order. The Defendant shall solely bear the costs and expenses of the transfer

> (4)     The Defendant shall transfer her share, title and interest in the property known as XX2, Australia _("XX2 property")_ to the Plaintiff within 3 months of the date of this Order. The Plaintiff shall be responsible for paying the outstanding mortgage loan and the outgoings from the date of this Order. The Plaintiff shall solely bear the costs and expenses of the transfer.

> (7)     The two bank accounts that are held in the parties' joint names, namely the Post Office Savings Bank (POSB) account number XXX (in Singapore) and the St George bank account number XXX (in Australia) shall be closed within 3 months of the date of this Order. Upon the closure of these accounts, the monies in the POSB account number XXX shall be paid to the Defendant and the monies in the St George bank account number XXX shall be paid to the Plaintiff.

> (8)     Maintenance. The Plaintiff shall pay to the Defendant a monthly sum of SGD $860.00 as the children's maintenance (SGD $430.00 for B and SGD $430.00 for C with effect from 30 November 2018 and thereafter on the last day of each month. Payment shall be made into the Defendant's OCBC Statement Savings Account No. XXX

> (9)     That there shall be no maintenance for the Defendant wife

> (10)     Each party to bear their own costs of the proceedings

> (11)     That there be liberty to apply

6       The Plaintiff (husband) has appealed against part of my decision in the Ancillary Order of Court dated 12 November 2018 on children’s access (clauses 2(b)(i) and 2 (c)(i) only), the children’s maintenance (clause 8) and on the division of matrimonial assets (clauses 3 and 5). I now provide my reasons.

## Custody, care and control of the children

7       Both parties agreed to have joint custody of the two children with care and control to the wife[^10]. It is not in dispute that the two children of the marriage had been living with the wife in Singapore since the husband left for Australia in 2014. The children have also been attending school in Singapore and the wife is the primary care giver, at least since 2014. I am of the view that, given the circumstances, it was not in the best interest of the children to uproot to live with the husband in Australia. I therefore made a consent order for the parties to have joint custody of the two children of the marriage with care and control to the wife.

## Access

8       Both parties were agreeable to the husband having reasonable telephone and other internet access at all other times when the children are living with the wife in Singapore[^11]. I included that in for access order. The main disagreement was for access during the school holidays.

9       The husband submitted that as the children are residing in Singapore while he is in Australia, the only time that he would get to spend with his children is when they are having school holidays. He wanted the children spend 80% of their long school holidays with him in Australia[^12].

10     The wife submitted that the school-going children were now 14 and 12 years old and as they grow older, the two children will have greater school commitments. She argued that these long stays away from Singapore during the school holidays have become very disruptive as they, like any other students, would frequently have enrichment classes, school camps and co-curricular activities (CCAs) during part of the school holidays. The Wife’s position was that the Husband should now come to Singapore especially during the shorter school breaks to exercise access rather than the children flying over to Australia (the latter is a very disruptive arrangement). For example, she cited an instance that the older son, B, had missed a school leadership in 2015 and two school rugby matches and training sessions in March 2016 because of having to visit the husband in Australia during the school holidays. As the older boy had been admitted to the school primarily on his rugby achievements, it would be detrimental for the child to miss so many games. The wife counter-proposed that the husband have access for 1 week during the mid-year holidays and 2 weeks during the year-end holidays.[^13]

11     It is pertinent that the husband himself unilaterally moved to Australia more than 4 years ago in 2014, leaving behind the 2 children in the wife’s care. In determining access, it is trite that the purpose of access is to allow the parent not having care and control of the children to maintain regular contact with them: see **_BG v BF_** <span class="citation">\[2007\] SGCA 32</span> at \[11\], **_TV v TW_** <span class="citation">\[2007\] SGHC 113</span> at \[93\]. It is not primarily meant to significantly allow the child to build a rapport with the Husband’s girlfriend or parents or with his other child whom he had with his new partner. The Court has to balance both the parties’ preferences against the children’s wishes and the children’s regular activities and consider the children’s best interest.

12     I agree with the wife’s arguments that the children should not be inconvenienced by the Husband. If anything, the Husband should make himself available for the children. The Husband did not provide any satisfactory reasons why he, if he works as a school teacher in Queensland, Australia, cannot at all travel to exercise access in Singapore. It is generally accepted knowledge that the school holidays for the local schools in Singapore do not fall exactly on the all same days as those for the Australian schools [^14]. Besides wanting the children to travel to Australia to meet him, the husband ought to be able and should make reasonable efforts to sometimes travel to Singapore to see the children either during part of or even outside children’s long school holidays. I accepted the undisputed evidence that the children have school camps and co-curricular activities, such as rugby, to attend during part of their school holidays. That would leave about 2 ½ weeks and 6 weeks in the mid-year and year-end school holidays respectively when the children would be completely free from CCAs, school activities and school preparatory work[^15]. Each parent ought to have roughly equal time with the children during these “free periods in the school holidays”.

13     Using a broad brush approach, I therefore allowed the husband to have one (1) week access during the mid-year (May/June) holidays and three (3) weeks access at year-end (November/December) holidays each year, either in Singapore or in Australia. In addition, I granted the husband additional access to the children for two (2) weeks[^16]_during the school term_s each time whenever he comes to Singapore[^17]. He could do so during his school holiday breaks in Australia[^18] or during his annual leave and so be involved with their school home work and school activities. I consider these terms of access to be quite generous to the husband and would promote the welfare of the children.

## Matrimonial Assets

#### The Plaintiff’s (husband’s) position

14     The Husband only wanted the 3 properties to be divided, namely at XX3 (“XX3”) and two properties in Australia at XX2 and XX1. He argued there was no need to enquire into who paid for what asset as all of the parties’ expenditure came from their ‘pooled’ assets’[^19]. He asked for the matrimonial assets to be divided in the ratio of 60 %: 40 % in his favour[^20] This was because his counsel claimed that the husband, having invested time and effort into the non-financial aspects of married life, would have made an indirect contribution of 70%[^21]. He claimed his direct financial contributions to the marriage was 50% as follows[^22]:

> (1)     One, he contributed to the purchase of XX3 as the deposit being paid came from sale proceeds of the XX5 and XX6 properties, of which he had paid the mortgage instalments of the latter two properties.

> (2)     Two, there was rental income from the XX3 property which the Wife had rented out from a date unknown to him.

> (3)     Three, he contributed to the purchase of XX1, Australia, property as the deposit being paid came from the proceeds of sale of the XX6 property where he had paid off the mortgage instalments.

15     In summary, the husband wanted the wife to transfer, at no consideration, to him her rights, title and interests in the 2 Australian properties at XX2 and XX1 while the wife can keep the XX3[^23].

#### Defendant wife’s position

16     The wife wanted the court to treat the XX1 property as _sui generis_ and be divided under the classification method apart from the rest of the matrimonial assets. Her reason was because XX1 was not acquired as a result of the co-operative partnership of efforts the marriage represented. The wife wanted the Court to ascribe 100% weightage to direct financial contributions because indirect contributions did not play any role in the acquisition of XX1. Therefore, the Wife submitted that the XX1 property ought to be transferred to her entirely[^24].

17     As for the other assets (including the XX3 and XX2, Australia properties) (“Pool A”), the wife submitted that the Court ought to use the global assessment method and utilise the income method when making a finding on direct financial contributions. She said that she paid AUD 213,738.35 towards the XX2 property[^25]. She submitted that all the mortgage payments of AUD 239,554.20[^26] for the XX2 property were attributed to her. Hence the wife would have made a 100% direct contribution towards the XX2 Property.[^27].

18     As for the XX3 property, she claimed she paid $747,888.53 as opposed to the husband’s contribution of $75,309.97 after apportioning the payments in accordance to the ratio of their incomes at 80 %:20% in favour of the wife and cash payment from the sale proceeds of an earlier XX5 property at 77%:23% in favour of the wife. This would give a direct contribution in percentage points as 91% for the wife against 9 % for the husband[^28].

19     Taking into account the XX3 and XX2 properties together with the other assets such as bank accounts balances, the wife arrived a direct contribution ratio of 80 % : 20 % in her favour[^29]. As for the indirect contributions, counsel asked the Court to ~take into account that he and she not lived in that flat and that it should b~e placed it at 70 %: 30 % in the wife’s favour. This would give a final division of the pool of assets (excluding the XX1 property) at 75 % for the wife and 25 % for the husband. As the husband’s sole assets amounted to $105,785.97, the husband should be given an amount of $101,681.93 from the sales proceeds if XX2 property is sold.

## My Decision

20     Section 112 (2) of the Women’s Charter provides a list of factors to be considered by the court in exercising its discretion in the division of matrimonial assets in such proportions as the court thinks just and equitable.

21     In carrying the exercise in the division of assets, I followed the approach laid out in the case of **_NK v NL_** <span class="citation">\[2007\] 3 SLR (R) 743</span> and in **_ANJ v ANK_** <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span>. The general steps are (a) first, to determine and value the pool of matrimonial assets, (b) considering the direct contributions of the parties, (c) considering the indirect contributions of the parties and (d) determining a just and equitable apportionment of the matrimonial assets and making consequential order to achieve the final distribution.

#### Determining the pool of matrimonial assets

22     In **_ARX v ARY_** <span class="citation">\[2016\] 2 SLR 686</span> at \[31\], the Court of Appeal held that the starting point for the operative date to determine the pool of matrimonial assets for division would be at the date of Interim Judgment. In this case, the parties also agreed to use the Interim Judgment as the cut-off date for the pool of matrimonial assets[^30]. I find there was no special circumstances in this case to depart from this default position. I therefore use the Interim Judgment date to determine the pool of matrimonial assets. Based on this, the pool would comprise the 2 properties in Australia, namely, at XX2 and at XX1, the flat at XX3 (“XX3 property”), the sale proceeds of the 290/292 XX4 property, the parties’ CPF accounts, their respective bank accounts in Singapore and in Australia.

23     During the hearing, the parties are in general agreement with the identity and the valuation of the majority of the assets. These are found in the Wife’s Third Written Submissions DS-3 and the Wife’s Updated Table of Relevant Information (Agreed and Disputed Assets) (Combined) in DS-4[^31]. The disputed assets relate to the XX1 property and a diamond ring and their alleged liabilities. I now turn to deal with these disputed assets and purported liabilities.

### Disputed matrimonial assets

#### (a)   Alleged third party interest in XX1

24     Initially, at the first hearing of the ancillary issues on 29.3.2018 before another District Judge (“1st DJ”), the wife sought to exclude from the matrimonial pool the property at XX1 (**“XX1”)**. This property at XX1 is an Australian property registered jointly in the names of the Plaintiff and the Defendant. It has been paid for in full and is unencumbered. The Defendant alleged this property was held on trust by the parties for the wife’s mother and aunt (“third parties”) who “had contributed funds towards the purchase price”. The Plaintiff, on the other hand, initially took the position that XX1 was a gift to the parties and a matrimonial asset. The 1st DJ ordered the Singapore proceedings to be stayed pending conclusion of the proceedings in Australia in relation to the property at XX1, Australia[^32].

25     Subsequently, the wife decided to withdraw the “third parties’ interest” issue and accepted that the XX1 property is a matrimonial asset[^33]. By that time, the 1st DJ was not available to continue to hear this case. The ancillary matter proceedings then came before me for hearing. The Husband did not pursue the argument that the monies paid towards this property from the wife’s mother was a gift[^34]. I note that both parties had included this XX1 property in their respective first Affidavits of Assets and Means filed on 21 March 2017[^35] as part of the list of their assets that they had acquired during the marriage in 2010 and that they held it as joint tenants. The wife did not raise the issue of “trust” or “a third party interest” until her Second Ancillary Affidavit 6 months later[^36]. Given that this property was acquired and held in the parties’ names during the marriage and since the Wife and the Wife’s mother were no longer raising 3rd party interests in the XX1 property[^37], I included this property into the pool of assets. The contributions from the Wife’s mother will be regarded as the wife’s contribution towards the acquisition of the assets for the purposes of the division.

#### (b)   Parties agree to exclude the Sale Proceeds of XX4

26     Both parties agree by consent to exclude a 4th property at XX4 Way from the division[^38]. This property was held in the names of the husband’s parents, the husband and the husband’s sister. There was a signed written agreement that the said property would be co-owned by 3 couples[^39]. It was sold in 2015 and has a net proceeds of $5,000 which was given to one party. As the parties voluntarily agreed to exclude this asset and given that the amount involved was relatively insignificant as compared to the other assets, I agree to exclude this property from the pool of assets for division[^40].

#### (c)   Diamond ring to be excluded

27     The wife wanted to include into the pool of assets a diamond ring allegedly valued at AUD 13,000 (SGD 13,260). This was listed as an item in the 2016 home contents insurance policy for XX2 property[^41]. The Husband’s counsel argued that the ring belonged to the husband’s D (who had cohabitated with the husband since end 2015) and that ring was an heirloom passed from D’s parents. He submitted that the fact that the ring was an insured item in the house contents was not directly indicative of the husband’s ownership[^42]. The wife claimed that the ring ought to belong to the husband because he is the owner of a policy that insured the ring and he paid for the premium and if there is a claim (for loss of the ring), he would receive the benefits from the policy. Secondly, it was also by custom that an engagement ring is provided by the party proposing the marriage to the other party[^43].

28     It is trite that he who asserts has the evidential burden to prove that assertion. I find that there is insufficient credible evidence to show that the diamond ring is a matrimonial asset. First, the wife is unable to show any credible evidence that directly shows this diamond ring either belonged to the husband or was in the husband’s possession during the marriage. She did not deny that the diamond ring was with the husband’s fiancée but alleged that the husband “must have bought it” for his fiancée’. This was her bare assertion. The fact that it was an engagement ring does not by itself necessarily mean that it must have been provided or purchased by the husband for his “fiancée girlfriend”. Second, the available evidence does not suggest that the husband had bought such a ring for the fiancée’ as the husband was a full time university student and earned no salary during the period from 2015 to 2017. Moreover, his Australian St George Bank account from January to June 2016 revealed that he had very little money then and there were no withdrawals of such large sums of money that could have been used to purchase that diamond ring[^44]. Hence, I find that was insufficient evidence to show that the husband had used any matrimonial funds to purchase the ring. It was more likely that not that the ring belonged to the third party. I accepted the husband’s assertion that he did not buy this ring and that his fiancée had provided this ring for this purpose. Therefore, I did not regard the diamond ring as a matrimonial asset and I therefore excluded it from the pool.

### Alleged Liabilities

#### (a)   Plaintiff’s Alleged Outstanding superannuation payments

29     The husband claimed that he owed outstanding payment of AUD 50,000 to the Australian Tax Office and AUD 10,000 to the Australian Superannuation Office which he claimed to be joint debts that arose from their joint business in Shanghai XXX. He also exhibited unsigned “Draft Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity” and “Certificate by Guarantor” to XXX Pty Ltd (collectively referred to as the “Deed” or “guarantee document”) for a lease that purportedly listed him and the wife as guarantors[^45]. However, this claim was disputed by the Wife. The wife countered that the debts owed by the Business Shanghai XXX were owed by the XXX Family Trust, which is a separate legal entity, and not by the husband personally. That was the whole reason why the parties ran the Shanghai XXX through the Trust so that they would not be personally absolved of all personal liability. Secondly, the wife said that the guarantee document was unenforceable as the “Deed” document was not signed. Third, the wife claimed that the “documents exhibited were extremely dated and refer to debts that may well have been paid or compounded by now”[^46].

30     Having perused the documents, I agreed with the wife’s submissions that there was insufficient credible evidence to conclude that the husband has a current personal liability towards the Australian Tax office and the Australian Superannuation Office at the operative date in December 2016 or at the date of the Ancillary Matter hearing in 2018 for these reasons. One, the business Shanghai XXXy was a company limited by shares and was therefore a separate legal entity from the parties[^47]. These debts, if any, were owed by the company (or at the very most was attributable to the XXX Family Trust, a separate legal entity) to the authorities and should not be regarded as the husband’s personal debts. Two, these company’s debts were owed to the Australian authorities in the years 2012 to August 2014 and, despite the additional time taken for discovery and interrogatories, the husband did not adduce any documentary evidence to show that such debts still existed at the date of the Interim Judgment in December 2016 or time of the hearing of the Ancillary matter[^48]. The husband had not produced any correspondence from the Australian authorities stating his personal debts owed to the Authorities in the years 2016 and 2018. It is trite that the burden of proof is on the party who asserts this claim, namely, the husband. The husband had not discharged this burden. Three, the purported liability under the alleged Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity for the lease taken up by the business Shanghai XXX in 2010 was either non-existent or unenforceable in law as the evidence adduced showed that “the Deed” was neither signed nor properly executed by the parties or by the company. I therefore rejected this claim by the husband.

#### (b)   Plaintiff’s Alleged credit card debts

31     The husband also claimed he had credit card loans of AUD 10,000 owed to St George Bank and SGD 10,000 to OCBC Easicredit (OCBC Bank)[^49]. The wife’s response was that the St George Bank credit card bill at 25 May 2014 was “very dated” and the debt was likely to be paid off by now. There was also no evidence of the breakdown of this debt. As for the supposed loan of $10,000 taken by the husband from OCBC Bank for XX3, the wife stated that it did not exists as the husband did not even have an OCBC account. Also, all the finances relating to XX3 property was solely provided by the wife[^50].

32     I agreed with the wife’s arguments that there was no credible evidence adduced as to how the debts were incurred for the St George’s Vertigo Platinum credit card and that these debs were incurred for the benefit of the family. The credit card statement for the period of 28 April to 25 May 2014 tendered in by the husband[^51] revealed only late payment and interest charges on that account as at 25 May 2014. The outstanding balance even after including interest and late payment charges as at May 2014 was $9,668.16 and was different from the figure of AUD $10,000 that the husband had claimed.

33     Similarly, there was insufficient evidence to show that the Plaintiff husband was liable for OCBC Easicredit loan of $10,000, that this amount was incurred for the benefit of the family and that this alleged debt was still outstanding at the operative date on 17 December 2016 or after that date. No reliable documentary evidence was tendered to the Court on this. It is trite that the party who asserts a fact has the burden to adduce sufficient credible evidence to prove it. The husband had not satisfactorily discharged this burden.

34     Hence, I rejected the husband’s claim to offset these amounts from the matrimonial pool.

#### (c)   Wife’s Alleged loan of $466,300 from her aunt

35     The Defendant wife alleged in her affidavit that she had taken an alleged loan of $478,300 from her aunt, Mdm E (“Mdm E”), in February 2012 to cover family expenses following the failure of their business Shanghai xxx. This sum was deposited into her Singapore POSB account xxx (“POSB bank account xxx”) on 10 February 2012[^52]. She alleged that these funds were “initially used” to “pay for family expenses as the husband failed to maintain the family at that time”. She claimed that she did use part of this amount to pay towards the purchase of XX3 property as “she was (then) low on funds”. According to her, her outstanding loan owed to her aunt is now $466,300 ($478,300 less six monthly transfers of $2,000 to her aunt from September 2012 to February 2013)[^53]. She wanted this figure of $466,300 to be deducted from the pool of matrimonial assets[^54]. The husband disputed this claim[^55].

36     Having assessed the evidence and circumstances, I reject the wife’s claim of an outstanding loan as the wife’s assertion was not substantiated by supporting documents. I find that her explanation for the transfer of these funds rather unsatisfactory. The documentary evidence on the deposits and withdrawals from her bank account did not disclose that this was a loan made by the wife’s mother to the wife. Neither did it substantiate her claim that the outstanding amount of the purported loan could be $466,300 at the operative date. The reasons are as follows:

> (1)     There was no supporting evidence by way of documents or written agreement or contemporaneous emails or messages to confirm that the deposit of $478,000, a substantial amount, was indeed a loan from Mdm E to the wife, the purpose of the loan and the terms of repayment. At the ancillary hearing, the wife’s counsel conceded on this point when she was queried by the Court[^56]. In addition, the wife’s allegation that this money was a loan was not corroborated by Mdm E. Mdm E had filed an affidavit on 22 Feb 2018 (DW-2) as a witness for the wife but she neither mentioned about this alleged “loan” to the wife and outstanding amount nor she did mention the intended use of this money and the amount of repayments to her.

> (2)     Second, it is inconceivable for the aunt to lend such a large sum for the expenses in Australia as around that time in early 2012, the wife was already working in Singapore and she earned an annual gross income of $162,999 for year 2012 (a net monthly salary of $14,832.33). According to her counsel, she was offered a 4-month contract job in Singapore in late 2011/early 2012 and in 2012, she then went onto a permanent full-time job with Deutsche Bank[^57]. There was no need for her to borrow such a large sum of money for Australian expenses as the wife was working and she received an annual gross income of $162,999 for year 2012 (a net monthly salary of $14,832.33) [^58]. It should be noted that this sum of $478,000 was equivalent to nearly 3 years’ worth of purported expenses using the wife’s inflated figure of $14,040 (purported monthly household expenses of $5,000 and her claim of alleged children expenses of $9,040 per month[^59])

> (3)     I also find the wife’s version that this was meant for household expenses rather doubtful as the whole amount of $478,300 was completely withdrawn from the POSB bank account within a 10-month period in 2012 (the original balance in the bank account prior to the deposit of $478,300 on 10 February 2012 was $23,877.22 and by 3 Oct 2012, the bank balance had dropped to only $4,797.00[^60]). The wife did not fully account for total sum of $478,300 withdrawn and how these funds were utilised (except for the two sums of $71,000 and $108,000 that she claimed she had repaid to Mdm E and the $80,000 and $30,000 she withdrew on 14 Feb 2012 and on 10 April 2012 respectively to bring to Australia[^61]). Furthermore, the remainder of the loan would no longer be needed by November 2012 as the parties moved back with the children to Singapore[^62]). As the purported loan was meant for expenses in Australia, there was no satisfactory explanation proffered as to why the balance of the purported loan continued to remain outstanding at $466,300 until 2016.

> (4)     In addition, her claim that the alleged outstanding figure of $466,300 owed to Mdm E was shown to be not true. The wife had initially claimed in her first Ancillary Affidavit DAM-1 that the “outstanding loan” as at the operative date was $466,300 because she had allegedly repaid only $12,000 to her aunt Mdm E from September 2012 to February 2013 from her POSB bank account xxx[^63]. However, she conceded in her responses to interrogatories on the nature of the withdrawals that she had withdrawn a total of $178,000.00[^64] in August 2012 to pay to or “reimburse” Mdm E. The wife’s claim that the $71,000 withdrawn on 7 Aug 2012 to “reimburse” Mdm E for the stamp fees for the XX3 property is also doubtful as one, this figure did not tally with the stamp fee of $70,953 and two, the stamp fees was actually paid using the wife’s CPF moneys on 28 Sep 2012 and there was a corresponding refund of $70,953 eleven days later on 9 Oct 2012 into the wife’s POSB account. (see CPF letters both dated 12 September 2012 and Bank statement)[^65]. Similarly, the cash withdrawal of $107,000 did not tally with the figure of $101,800.80 for the 5% down payment for the purchase of XX3. Moreover, at the hearing, counsel for the wife conceded that the purported outstanding loan towards Mdm E was at a significantly lower figure as the wife could not satisfactorily account for the withdrawals from the bank account[^66]. The wife’s assertion that she still owed $466,300.00 to her aunt as at the date of the Interim Judgment was not supported by the documentary evidence.

37     For the above reasons, I reject the wife’s claim that she had an outstanding debt of $466,300 owed to her aunt that could be deducted from the pool of matrimonial assets.

38     As for her credit card debts, I note that for the DBS Cashline and the Citibank Ready Credit liabilities, there were no evidence adduced to show how these debts were incurred and whether these debts were incurred for the benefit of the family[^67]. For the OCBC credit card, I note that most of the expenses incurred were likely to be her own personal expenses, including hospital and osteopathic relief services and a payment of late interest charges, travel charges and there is insufficient evidence to show that these were meant for the benefit of the family[^68]. I therefore declined to deduct these purported liabilities from the pool of assets.

### Pool of Assets

39     Use the date of the Interim Judgment (26 Dec 2016) as the agreed operative date, a summary of the assets to be included in the matrimonial pool are set out in the table below.

### Division of the matrimonial assets

40     In determining a just and equitable division, and with a view to accord due and sufficient recognition to each party’s contribution towards the marriage, whether in the economic or homemaking spheres, the Court of Appeal has held, in **_ANJ v ANK_** <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span> (“ANJ v ANK”) and in **_Twiss, Christopher James Hans v Twiss, Yvonne Prendergast_** <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGCA 52</span> at \[17\], that the division of matrimonial assets must be exercised in ‘broad strokes’ utilising the structured approach in the following steps:

> “(a)  Express as a ratio the parties’ direct contributions relative to each other, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets;

> (b)    Express as second ratio the parties’ indirect contributions relative to each other, having regard to both financial and non-financial contributions; and

> (c)    Derive the parties’ overall contributions relative to each other taking an average of the two ratios above, keeping in mind that, depending on the circumstances of each case, the direct and indirect contributions may not be accorded equal weight and one of the two ratios may be accorded more significance than the other.”

41     I next proceeded to apply this structured approach in _ANJ v ANK_ to the facts of the present case. I will deal with each of the assets in turn.

### Parties’ Direct Contributions

42     The parties acquired a number of properties during the course of the marriage. Only three of them are currently held by the parties, the XX2t property and XX1 property in Australia and the XX3 property (in Wife’s sole name). It would be necessary to deal with the flow or movement of monies used for the purchase of these properties as the sale proceeds of some of the properties were applied toward the purchase of the other properties. These purchases were as follows:

#### Aspen Heights property

43     I will first deal with the parties’ contributions towards the property at XX3, Singapore (“XX3” property). This was the matrimonial home for the family at the time of the breakdown in the marriage. They stayed in this home when they returned sometime in mid-2012 to Singapore from Australia. This matrimonial home was purchased in 2012 in the wife’s sole name for a price of $2,545,020.00. The documentary evidence showed that that the bridging loan of $150,000.00, the legal fees and stamp fees were actually paid using the wife’s CPF moneys on 28 Sep 2012 (see CPF letters both dated 12 September 2012 and Bank statement)[^71]. She also paid the down payment of $101,800.80[^72].

44     A sum of $132,792.45 was also paid for the completion of the purchase of XX3 property[^73]. The Husband claimed that the sale proceeds of the XX5 property were used to pay towards the XX3 property. The Wife’s counsel did not dispute this. I was prepared to accept this point as the cash sales proceeds of $157,434.64 from the sale of the XX5 property was deposited into the same POSB account just about 1 week later on 12 October 2012[^74]. From the CPF refunds made ($151,528.76 to the Wife and $52,548.19 for the Husband) [^75], I ascertained the direct contributions by the parties towards the XX5 property was in the region of 25.7% for the husband and 74.3 % by the wife as shown in the table below:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="33%"> <col width="33.3%"> <col width="33.7%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Item</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Husband ($)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Wife ($)</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">CPF Refunds to parties’ (XX5 property)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">52,548.19</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">151,528.78</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Ratio of direct contributions</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">25.7 %</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">74.3 %</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

The remaining sale proceeds ($157,434.64 credited into the bank account) would then be apportioned between the parties in accordance to their direct contributions towards the XX5 property. Applying this ratio of their contributions of 25.7% : 74.3% to the sum of $157,434.64, the Husband’s share of the sale proceeds would be about $40,538.16 (25.7% x $157,434.64) while the wife’s share would be $116,896.48. Hence, for this sum of $132,792.45 paid as part of the initial payment upon completion of the purchase, I attributed $40,538.16 as the Husband’s contribution while the remaining balance of $92,254 ($132,792.45 less $40,538) would be contributed by the Wife.

45     The wife paid the mortgage payments for the XX3 (loan was in the wife’s name). This amounted to cash of $380,693.00 and CPF deductions of $57,500 from November 2012 to the date of Interim Judgment. When the husband returned to Singapore to live in late 2012, he did not work while the Wife would go out to work[^76]The respective direct contributions would be:

#### XX2 Property

46     This asset in Australia (“XX2” property) was purchased in March 2010 for AUD 910,000 and parties took a housing loan of AUD 728,000. The contract date for the purchase was on 4 February 2010.[^77] The parties and the children lived in this property when they relocated to Australia sometime in 2010 until their return to Singapore in mid-2012. There were initial capital payments, and mortgage cash payments made towards the acquisition of this property as well as mortgage repayments towards the joint housing loan[^78]. The Wife claimed that their respective direct contributions should be 8 % for the husband and 92 % for her. On the other hand, the husband claimed that it should be 39.7 % for him and 60.3 %for the Wife[^79].

47     I first deal with the initial capital payments for the XX2 property. The documentary evidence showed that a sum of AUD 213,738.35 was initially paid towards the property. I accept the Wife’s contention that she paid for this sum as her claims were supported by documentary evidence. Both the first deposit of AUD 40,010.00 and the second payment of AUD 33,975.00 in February 2010 originated from her POSB xxx [^80] (which account was in her sole name in the year 2010 until it was later converted to a Joint account in October 2012 to allow to deposit into that account the joint sale proceeds from the sale of the XX5 property). The payments were made to the property agent who handled the property transaction and the funds came from the sale proceeds of the XX6 property[^81]. I will briefly deal with the source of these funds as the husband claimed that he should have a share of those funds[^82].

48     It was not in dispute that the property at XX6 (XX6 property) was bought by the Wife’s mother for $1.6 million in 2007 and held in the Wife’s mother’s sole name. The mortgage loan for this property was taken out by the Wife’s sole name because the mother had difficulty getting a housing loan because of her age. Both the wife and her mother contributed to the mortgage loan via a joint account in their names that was opened for this specific purpose. The exact amounts that the mother and the Wife had paid towards this mortgage loan is unknown as the Wife could not obtain the relevant bank records as all these took place more than 7 years ago[^83]. The husband did not dispute that the Wife paid a total of $122,600 as initial sum for the purchase. This comprised $16,000 as 1 % option fee, $64,000 as 4 % balance of the deposit and $42,000 for stamp duty (paid using cheques issued in the wife’s sole name from her sole name POSB account xxx in 2007)[^84]. This XX6 property was sold in 2010 for $2.4 million and the sale proceeds were credited to the Wife’s mother’s savings account. The wife’s mother later transferred in March 2010 the sums of $49,107.41 and $520,000) which the wife claims to be her share of the sale proceeds) into the Wife’s POSB account xxx[^85]. I accepted the Wife’s contention that the monies in her sole POSB account xxx at that time were her monies from her share of the sale proceeds as the husband did not make any direct contribution at all to the purchase of the XX6 property. I did not accept the husband’s arguments that the monies from the XX6 property should be apportioned equally to the parties[^86] as there was, at the relevant time, no evidence of any express intention of the parties to do so and because the manner in which the sales proceeds were dealt with (based on the documentary evidence) showed that it belonged to the Wife. Hence, the initial sum of AUD 213,738.35 paid towards the XX2 property was entirely from the Wife.

49     The other sum of AUD 139,753.35 (part of the initial payment) was provided by the Wife’s mother and that sum was withdrawn from the Australian bank account a few days later in Feb 2010.[^87] The wife had transferred the monies into the parties’ joint Australian St George Account because she did not have an Australian Account in her sole name. The Wife claimed that this money was meant for her to use and not as a gift to both parties[^88]. I agree with the Wife’s contention as there is no presumption of a gift since this was not the first property that the parties bought as a matrimonial home at the time of their marriage. Hence, I would attribute the initial capital payment of AUD 213,738.15[^89] as the Wife’s contributions.

50     In addition to these initial sums paid, there were mortgage repayments for this property towards a joint loan in their names amounting to AUD 266,566.79 [^90]. This can be divided into 2 periods of payment. According to the Defendant, the repayments towards XX2 property came from the POSB account in Singapore and was supplemented by their business earnings in Australia. This took place between 2010 to July 2014. However, from July 2014 (mid-2014), the Plaintiff took over managing the repayment of the mortgage when he left Singapore in that year and resided in XX2. Most of these payments towards the mortgage loan from mid-year 2014 onwards came from rental income from renting out rooms in the XX2 property and some from the rental income from XX1property[^91]. The Plaintiff admitted that the rental incomes from XX2 and XX1 properties were deposited either directly or through the Commonwealth Bank account into their St George’s bank account (from which some of the monies were then utilised to pay towards the mortgage loan and the Plaintiff’s daily expenses)[^92].

51     The parties agreed to use the income method to determine their respective contributions from the monthly mortgage repayments from the POSB account towards the XX2 property [^93]. I agree with this for the first period from 2010 till July 2014 because during that period, both parties did not dispute that they did pool their resources from their incomes (which were deposited into the POSB account) and from their business earnings in Australia to make payment towards their expenses and for the loan repayments for this property. This occurred when the parties were still together as a couple until July 2014 (when the Plaintiff then left the family and unilaterally moved to Australia[^94]). Hence, their contribution towards the mortgage repayments from March 2010 till July 2014 will be based on the ratio of the incomes.

52     Parties were in agreement on their respective incomes over the course of the marriage. These can be found in their income statements and Notice of Assessments[^95]. Based on the table of income for the parties, the Wife accounted for nearly 82 % of the parties’ income during the marriage while the husband only earned 18 % of their combined incomes[^96]. The husband conceded that his income for 2016 was zero as he was a full-time student studying to be a teacher[^97]. This is reproduced below:

53     From the bank documents, the amount of mortgage repayments from March 2010 till July 2014 amounted to AUD 187,574.26[^107]. Therefore, applying the income ratio, the husband’s contribution from Mar 2010 till June 2014 will be AUD 33, 763.37 (18% x AUD$187,574.26) while the wife’s contribution towards this repayment loan for this period would be AUD$ 153,810.89.

54     As for the mortgage repayments after July 2014, the monies came from rental incomes from the 2 Australian properties, XX2 and XX1. As mentioned above at \[51\], the rental incomes were deposited either directly or through the Commonwealth Bank account into their St George’s bank account (from which some of the monies were then utilised to pay towards the mortgage loan and the Plaintiff’s daily expenses)[^108]. A total of $78,992.53 of the loan repayments were paid using the rental monies from Aug 2014 till December 2016[^109]. This contribution will be attributed equally to the parties as the two Australian properties were held in joint names and because there was express intention to treat the rental income unequally. The Husband and the Wife would each have contributed about AUD 39,446.27. I did not agree with the Wife’s counsel’s submission to treat this as all her contributions “as she was the one acquired the asset wholly and so would be entitled to the proceeds generated from the asset”[^110]. I also did not agree with the husband’s counsel’s argument that the “rental income from XX2 property should be attributed solely to the husband simply because the rental income from XX3 property (in the Wife’s sole name and paid for by the wife) were attributed to the Wife”. This was because the evidence clearly showed that both parties did contribute to the acquisition of the XX2 property and there was no express intention to treat the rental income unequally when they were used towards the loan repayments. Unless parties had expressly agreed to apportion the rental income for an encumbered property based on their relative direct contributions, it would not be appropriate to do so because that ratio would be constantly changing at various times. Therefore, the total contributions towards the XX2 property would be as shown below:

55     Hence, the parties’ contribution towards the XX2 property would be 15 % for the husband and 85% for the Wife.

#### XX1 property

56     This property in Australia was bought on or about March 2011 for a sum of AUD 570,000.00. That property is unencumbered.[^111] The funds came from the Wife’s mother and her aunt who had wanted to have an Australian property. There are documents evidencing the telegraphic transfer of AUD 503,325.07 (AUD20,458.71 plus AUD482,866.36) from the Wife’s mother and the wife’s aunt into the St George bank account in April 2011 and subsequent payment from that bank account (AUD 504,122.80 and other cheques) to pay towards the XX1 property[^112]. The property was registered in names of the husband and wife due to restrictions under Australian law on foreigners owning Australian properties. Only Australian Citizens and residents can buy such properties directly[^113].

57     The wife had earlier accepted that this was a matrimonial asset (see \[24\] and \[25\]). The husband did not pay any money towards the acquisition of the house. He had tried to argue that this was a gift to both of them. I did not agree as the contemporaneous emails between the Wife and his mother and aunt in March 2011 showed that this was meant to be an investment property to be let out as a holiday “sea-view house” to be managed for her two relatives and there was no evidence that the moneys or the property was meant as a gift to both of them. The parties were allowed by the Wife’s aunt to use some of the rental monies from this property for their expenses[^114]. As the Wife received these funds (through the joint bank account) and utilised them for the purchase the property, I regarded these monies to be effectively the Wife’s contribution towards the property. She would have, after the division of the assets, to account to her relatives separately for the funds she had received and utilised. Therefore, 100% of the value of XX1 property was contributed by the Wife.

58     As for the remaining matrimonial assets, the parties did not dispute that the husband had SGD$92,954.52 worth of other assets (2 joint bank accounts, Commonwealth Bank account, QT Mutual bank account and CPF monies) while the wife’s other assets amounted to SGD$193,3034.39 (2 joint bank accounts, 2 OCBC bank accounts and CPF monies[^115].

### Parties’ Indirect Contributions

59     Having determined the direct contributions for the 3 properties, I now turn to the indirect contributions by the parties. This was roughly a 14-year marriage with 2 children and both parties were working.

60     The husband asked the Court to attribute his “non-financial contributions to the marriage as 70 % in his favour”[^116] due to his following contributions:

> (1)     that he contributed to the finances of the family whereupon the parties’ incomes were combined together. He said that he had contributed to the children’s expenses, food, school fees, books, medical, transport and other miscellaneous items when he was gainfully employed. Also, in late 2011, when the Wife retuned to Singapore, he was with the children in Australia and he said he was the primary caregiver for about 4 months[^117]

> (2)     He said he also did marketing for the family and contributed to the costs of marketing, groceries and sundries. He claimed he did the household chores such as cooking, cleaning and washing. He conceded that when they were in Singapore, they had a domestic helper who assisted with the cooking, cleaning and washing[^118]. In his second affidavit, the husband claimed that he did most of the household chores as the Wife worked longer hours from 2006 to 2010[^119].

> (3)     In 2012, when the Wife moved back to Singapore to work, he said he looked after the Australian business and took care of the children for 6 months. He also played a major role in packing up the Australian residence. And when the family moved back to live in Singapore, he was the primary care-giver of the children for 1 year[^120].

> (4)     He alleged that he also provided financial contributions whenever the children were in Australia and that lasted for nearly 3 months in a year. He added that he also helped to maintain and ensure regular payments of utilities, tax rates and insurance premiums and did the management work for 2 Australian properties, XX2 and XX1.[^121]

61     In response, the wife’s counsel submitted that the Wife ought to be attributed 70% for her indirect contributions for the following main reasons:

> (1)     Her indirect financial contribution was high as she had contributed to nearly 83 % of the parties’ combined income during the marriage while the husband accounted for a mere 17 % share. She submitted it was clear that the Wife had paid for the bulk of the family expenses as she was earning higher and was always employed in a stable job with a regular income while the husband’s employment was at best erratic. [^122]

> (2)     The wife asserted that she paid for all the household expenses and bills during the marriage as well as costs for the family’s relocation to Australia[^123]

> (3)     Wife claimed the she was the children’s primary caregiver throughout all of their lives and also she took on a more traditional homemaker role and was the primary contributor to maintaining the household when they lived in Australia for nearly 2 years. The husband would spend more time to go for a surf before or after work when the weather permitted. The only time the Husband took care of the children was when the Wife was in Singapore for a 4-month contract position to earn more because the failing business[^124]

62     It is not uncommon for parties to a divorce to denigrate or play down the efforts and contributions of the other party to the marriage and to embellish their own alleged achievements. With this in mind, I went on to scrutinise the parties’ versions of their respective contributions. I find that the documentary evidence supported the Wife’s claims that she was the main contributor to the indirect financial contributions to the marriage. Her overall income during the duration of the marriage was at least 82 % of their combined income while the husband’s overall income was about 18% of their combined income (this excludes the 2016 figure where the Husband did not earn a regular income as he was a full-time student) (see \[52\] above). Parties agreed that during the marriage prior to 2016, the parties did pool their incomes to pay for the family expenses. The husband did not dispute the Wife’s contention that his contribution to the household and children expenses were minimal and that he used the supplementary credit card for which the wife was the primary card holder to pay for the household expenses. Hence, the Wife’s indirect financial contributions were much more significant that the Husband’s [^125]. In addition, I accepted the Wife’s contention that she did pay for the bulk of the family expenses including the relocation costs to Australia and contributions towards the Husband’s Shanghai XXX business in Australia as well as paying for the husband’s spinal surgery at a private hospital and the children flights to Australia between 2014 to 2016. This was not denied by the husband[^126].

63     As for the indirect non-financial contributions, I did not accept the husband’s claim that he did most of the housework, washing and groceries and cooking during the time they were in Singapore. This was because the parties had hired a domestic helper and the husband had conceded that the domestic helper had helped with the household chores and washing etcetera. I was of the view that most of the cooking and household chores when they were in Singapore were done by the domestic helper[^127]. The husband’s claim that he was the primary care giver of the children during the earlier years of the marriage before 2010 was contradicted by his admission in parts of the Defendant’s Counterclaim in the divorce. He was legally represented at that time and had consented to the Interim Judgment being granted on these grounds of unreasonable behaviour in the Counterclaim. These facts and admissions can be relied upon by the Court in assessing the parties’ behaviour and contributions during the marriage. For instance, he also admitted that he was not caring and “_not emotionally available and supportive of the Wife in any way_” during her breast cancer treatment in Singapore. At that time, the Husband, being suspicious of the Wife, could not control his emotions and “_left the house in the middle of the night, screamed loudly and punched a tree … until his knuckles bled ... and had banged himself against the car’s steering wheel and suffered injuries, in the presence of the children_”. It was the “_Wife who stay(ed) strong for the children as well, since the Husband was not emotionally available_”[^128]. He also admitted to “_accepting an overseas job and being away from the children_” and “_working in the alcohol industry that involved late night entertainment and frequent interaction with lingerie models and alcohol promotional girls_” before 2010[^129]. That meant that he was unlikely to be able to spend a lot of time than the Wife to care for the children.

64     He also conceded that when he was in Australia he “_placed his own interest and preferences above that of the family ... and he pursued the business so that he could achieve flexibility of working hours and freedom to surf as he pleased_”. And when “_their business venture in Australia failed and the Wife secured a full-time job (to support the family), the husband refused to give up his beach lifestyle and move back to Singapore_”[^130]. I note that the husband conceded that “_he worked long hours for his Shanghai XXX business and during the first 3 months of the business opening, he worked 7 days a week for over 12 hours a day_”. According to the husband, the Wife did not spend much time at the Australian business venture[^131]. In my view, I accepted the Wife’s submission that she took a more traditional home role in Australia and spend more time caring for the children than the husband during the period from 2010 to 2011. I accepted that the Husband looked after children for nearly 6 months in 2012 when the wife worked in Singapore although the Wife did return on weekends to see the children[^132]. During the first year when the family returned to Singapore around August 2012, the husband would spend more time with the children as he was not working full-time except for the time when he was recuperating after the spinal surgery because he was “_during that period in debilitating pain_” and could “_not do simple tasks such as putting shoes on_”[^133].

65     When the husband left the matrimonial home and relocated to Australia around June/July 2014, the Wife was the primary care giver of the two children and she was also responsible for all the household expenses and children expenses from that date till the date of the Interim Judgment (December 2016).

66     On the whole, taking into account the circumstances and the evidence, I came to the conclusion that the Wife had contributed significantly more in terms of both indirect financial and indirect non-financial contributions to the marriage than the husband. I took guidance from the 2 authorities cited by the Wife’s counsel. In **_ASI v ASJ_** <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 94</span>, the High Court considered a marriage of 12 years with 2 children in which both parties had worked full-time. The children were living with the wife for 3 years from the date of separation till the date of Interim Judgment. Their financial contributions to the marriage based on their declared income was about 52 % for the husband and 48 % for the wife. The Court awarded the wife 70% for her indirect contributions. In another case, **_TDW v TDX_** <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGFC 106</span>, the parties were married for 16 years with 2 children in which both parties worked full-time. The wife moved out of the matrimonial home with the 2 children and took care of them for 3years before the date of Interim Judgment. The Family Court awarded the wife 70% for her indirect contributions.

67     Taking into account all the relevant considerations, I was of the view that the indirect contributions of the parties towards the marriage in this case were broadly in the proportion of **65: 35** in the Wife’s favour. This ratio of indirect contributions will have to remain constant in relation to all assets under the classification methodology: see **_UBD v UBE_** <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHCF 14</span> at \[19(b)} and **_AYQ v AYR_** <span class="citation">\[2013\] 1 SLR 476</span> at \[22\] to \[23\].

### Classification Method

68     The Wife’s counsel submitted that the Court can either utilise the global assessment methodology or the classification methodology in the division of assets. Counsel further submitted that the Court of Appeal in **_NK v NL_** <span class="citation">\[2007\] 3 SLR(R) 743</span> has held “that the classification methodology would be more appropriate where there are multiple classes of assets and where the parties have made different contributions”. This was further elaborated in the case of **_TNC v TND_** <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHCF 9</span> where the High Court opined that “the classification methodology ought to be utilised where some of the assets to be divided were not wholly the gains of the co-operative partnership of efforts the marriage represented”. The High Court had “separated the matrimonial assets into quintessential matrimonial assets and those which were transformed by virtue of ordinary use and applied different weightages to the parties’ direct/indirect contributions for each group of assets”. Similarly, in **_UBD v UBE_** <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHCF 14</span>, the High Court said that it is more suitable to use the classification methodology “where there is a clear reason to make a different _ANJ v ANK_ calculation in relation to a class of assets some of which were not acquired as a result of the parties’ joint efforts”. I therefore adopted the above approach in choosing the appropriate methodology.

69     I agree with counsel’s submission that the XX1 property was not acquired as a result of the co-operative partnership of efforts in the marriage. This was a suitable case for using the classification approach. The direct financial contributions attributed to the Wife were substantial for XX1 property (with zero financial contribution by the husband). It was acquired with the full financial assistance from the Wife’s mother and aunt (“relatives”) and it was kept as an investment property to generate rental income to be repaid to the Wife’s relatives. Unlike XX3 property or the XX1, it (“XX1 property”) was also never used for residence as a matrimonial home. I am in agreement with the wife’s counsel in classifying the matrimonial assets into two groups, namely Group A would comprise the remainder of the assets, otherwise known as the quintessential matrimonial assets and Group B would consist solely of XX1. I was of the view that applying the classification approach would result in an equitable income.

#### Division of Group B Asset using the Classification Methodology

70     I start with the Group B asset which consist of the XX1 Property. I agree with the wife’s counsel’s arguments that the indirect contributions played a very minor contribution towards the acquisition and maintenance of the XX1 property. This was unlike the usual case where the indirect contributions of one spouse allowed the other spouse acquire an asset, for instance, when a homemaker spouse freed up the other spouse to be the breadwinner to earn income to pay for the asset. In this case, the funds were given to by the Wife’s mother and aunt (though an Australian bank account) and the Wife used it to purchase XX1. The purchase was completed within a few weeks. The property was fully paid up. In **_TNC v TND_** <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHCF 9</span> at \[44\], \[61\] to \[63\], JC Ong (as she then was) ascribed a higher weightage to the direct financial contributions to the group of non- quintessential assets. In the instant case, I took into account that the husband had allowed his name (as an Australian citizen) to be registered as a co-owner of XX1 in order to meet the requirement under Australian law for purchase of Australian properties[^134]. He also had assisted in the management of the XX1 during the marriage until April 2015 in making arrangement for the insurance payments, tax rate payments, repairs, upkeep and utilities”[^135]. On the current facts, the direct financial contributions should command a greater weight in comparison to the indirect contributions. I considered it just and equitable to a weightage of 90 % to the direct contributions and 10 % for the indirect contributions. Averaging the percentages for the direct and indirect contributions will yield a result as follows for XX1:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="52.38%"> <col width="23.8%"> <col width="23.82%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Husband</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Wife</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">A.

71     The value of the XX1 was agreed at SGD $777,815.13 (AUD 785,910)[^136]. The amount that the husband would receive would be about SGD$27,233. I ordered that the husband transfer his share, title and interest in XX1 to the wife upon receiving from her a payment of SGD27,233.00

#### Division for Group A Assets under the Classification Methodology

72     Group A assets would comprise quintessential matrimonial assets which were accrued as a result of the parties’ (or one party’s) effort throughout the marriage. I had already determined that the wife share of the XX2 property to be 85% and her share of the XX3 property as being 95 % (see \[45\] and \[54\] above). The parties’ contributions towards the pool of matrimonial assets in Group A were as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="51.64%"> <col width="24.18%"> <col width="24.18%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Description</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Husband’s Contributions</b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>($)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Wife’s’ Contributions</b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>($)</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">XX2</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(15%:85% of value $182,149.11)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"><p align="right" class="Table-Para-1">27,769.53</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"><p align="right" class="Table-Para-1">154,379.58</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">XX3</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(5%: 95% of value $894,039.25)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"><p align="right" class="Table-Para-1">44260.38</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"><p align="right" class="Table-Para-1">931869.70</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Other Assets (bank accounts and CPF monies)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"><p align="right" class="Table-Para-1">92,954.52</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"><p align="right" class="Table-Para-1">193,034.39</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Sub-total</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"><p align="right" class="Table-Para-1">164,984.43</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"><p align="right" class="Table-Para-1">1,279,283.67</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Total value of Group A Assets</p></td><td align="left" class="b" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">1,444,268.10</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Ratio</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"><p align="right" class="Table-Para-1">0.114</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"><p align="right" class="Table-Para-1">0.886</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

73     Applying the structured approach in _ANJ v ANK_ and using equal weightage to the direct and indirect contributions for a 14-year marriage, I arrived at the following ratios in respect of Group A assets:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="46.5%"> <col width="27.96%"> <col width="25.54%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"><p align="right" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Husband</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"><p align="right" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Wife</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="bottom"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">I.

74     With 23 % of the Group A assets, the Husband will get $332,181.00 (23% x $1,444,286.00) (rounded off). The parties would keep their other assets in their own name. The husband now stays in Australia at XX2 and he wants to take over that property. To do that, he will have to pay for the value of the Wife’s share in XX2 for it to be transferred to his sole name. After deducting the value of his other assets of $92,954 and offsetting the wife’s share ($182,49.11) (_sic_), I arrived at the conclusion that he should receive an additional $57,078.00 (round off). I ordered the wife to transfer her share, title and interest in XX2 and as part of the division of assets the husband would receive an additional $57,078.00 (_sic_).

75     I subsequently realised after the delivery of my decision that I had inadvertently made a computational error in arriving at the sum that the husband should be paid for his share in Group A assets after the division. The wife’s share in XX2 should be $154,380 (85%) and not $182,149. Hence, the husband should receive an additional **$84,848** (instead of $57,078). I seek the indulgence of the Appellate Court to correct this inadvertent computational error and adjust the award in paragraph 6 of the Ancillary Order accordingly.

## Maintenance

#### For the Wife

76     At the Ancillary hearing, the wife did not seek maintenance for herself. A maintenance order under section 113 of the Women’s Charter is meant to supplement the order for division of matrimonial assets and is to even out any financial inequities between the spouses suffered during the marriage: see _Foo Ah Yan v Chiam Heng Chow_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 2 SLR 506</span>; <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGCA 15</span> at \[26\] and _BG v BF_ \[2007\] 3 SLR (R) 233 at \[75\]. Here, the wife has been awarded 96.5% of Group A asset ($750,591.00) and 77% of Group B Assets (or $1,112,086.00). It was by no means a modest sum. Also, the Wife declared that she earned a gross monthly income of $19,208.33[^137]. Her Notice of Assessment for 2016 showed that she earned about $274,891 in year 2015 or an average gross monthly income (including bonus) of $22,907[^138]. This would be a more accurate figure. She estimated her monthly expenses to be $13,627.20. I find the estimates for many items to be excessive and assessed her reasonable expenses to be not more than $7,400.00 a month (including transport, rental, share of utilities and domestic helper’s costs and levy, her personal expenses, clothing and shoes, grooming, mobile phone, dining out, year-end holidays etcetera). She would have sufficient means to maintain herself. I therefore ordered no maintenance for the Wife as she was gainfully employed.

#### Children’s maintenance

77     Under section 127 of the Women’s Charter, the Court may order the non-custodial parent to pay the other party an amount towards the maintenance of a child of the marriage. The court will have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the matters listed in section 69(4) of the Women’s Charter. Section 69(4) of the Women’s Charter provided a list of non-exhaustive considerations that a court should take into account including, amongst other things, the financial needs of the child, the standard of living enjoyed by the child as well as the manner in which the child was being, and in which the parties to the marriage had expected him or her to be, educated or trained.

78     The husband had just completed his university studies in Queensland in July 2018 and is a secondary school teacher. At the time of filing his Fourth Ancillary Affidavit PAM-4 (paragraphs 5 to 8), he said his work prospects as a secondary school teacher were good and listed his expected salary. The parties informed the Court that their annual gross incomes of the husband and wife would be about $71,395 (AUD 70,000) and $274,891 respectively. The ratio of the husband’s earning capacity to the Wife’s income was about 20%: 80%. I consider it just and equitable in this case for the parties to contribute towards the children’s expenses in proportion to their respective incomes. I therefore decided that the husband will contribute 20 % while the Wife will bear the remaining 80 % of the maintenance for the children.

79     The husband did not contest the Wife’s estimates of the children’s expenses. I allowed the following reasonable expenses for the children’s monthly maintenance as shown in the tables below. For older child B, the figure was made out as follows:

81     Accordingly, the husband would pay 20 % of the cost of maintenance for each child estimated at SGD $430 per month. I therefore ordered the husband to pay a monthly sum of SGD $430.00 for each child’s maintenance.

## Costs

82     On the issue of costs, I note that the both parties did not “succeed” in their respective claims on the division of the matrimonial assets and maintenance. The divorce was granted on both the husband’s claim and the wife’s counterclaim. I find that it was appropriate to order each party to bear his or her own costs.
