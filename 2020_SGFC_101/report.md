Variation of Maintenance – Enforcement of Maintenance

3 December 2020

### District Judge Goh Zhuo Neng:

## A. INTRODUCTION

1       On 29 January 2020, I made the following orders:

> a)     That the Appellant ex-husband (“**Appellant**”) was ordered to pay the Respondent ex-wife (“**Respondent**”) a monthly sum of $500.00 for her maintenance for the period November 2019 to February 2020 (a total of 4 months). With effect from 1 March 2020, the maintenance paid by the Appellant would increase to $1,000.00 per month. Maintenance would be paid on the 1st day of the month (“**Order1**”).

> b)     That the Appellant would pay the Respondent arrears of maintenance up till 29 January 2020 (including January 2020 maintenance) which were fixed at $2,500.00 and to be repaid in instalments of $250.00 a month (“**Order2**”).

2       On 16 March 2020, the Respondent filed MSS 964 of 2020, an application for enforcement of maintenance under Order1 pursuant to Section 71 of the Women’s Charter (Cap.353) (“**WC**”). In the following applications filed on 27 April 2020, the Appellant sought a variation of Order1 under Section 72 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353) (“**WC**”).

> a)     MSS 1301 of 2020 – To reduce the maintenance sum from $500.00 to $100.00 per month.

> b)     MSS 1303 of 2020 – To suspend the maintenance payable under the order from 27 April 2020 to 31 October 2020.

3       All applications were heard on 26 August 2020 and parties were represented by counsel. I allowed a variation of maintenance under MSS 1301 of 2020 to provide that the Appellant shall pay $500.00 a month from March 2020 to October 2020 (a total of 8 months), with the maintenance returning to $1,000.00 a month in November 2020 (“**Variation Order**”).

4       Having done so, I dismissed MSS 1303 of 2020 and made the following order for enforcement of Order1 under MSS 964 of 2020 that (“**Enforcement Order**”):

> a)     The arrears under Order1 as of August 2020 (including maintenance for August 2020) were $5,500.00.

> b)     The arrears of $5,500.00 would be paid in instalments of $100.00 from 1 November 2020 into the Respondent’s bank account, on the 1st day of each month.

> c)     In the event that the matrimonial home was sold, and the Appellant was due to receive a sum exceeding the outstanding amount of arrears due under the Enforcement Order, the Appellant would repay all the outstanding arrears in a single payment within 2 weeks after receiving the sales proceeds.

5       On 7 September 2020, the Appellant filed a Notice of Appeal against my decision to grant the Variation Order and the Enforcement Order. I set out below the full grounds of my decision.

## B. VARIATION ORDER – MSS 1301 of 2020

6       The Appellant’s position in MSS 1301 of 2020 was that under s72 of the WC, the following material changes of circumstances had occurred which preventing him from continuing work as a taxi driver/private hire driver:

> a)     The Appellant was suffering from back problems that he was unable to remedy through therapy, such as physiotherapy, acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine (“**TCM**”). Physiotherapy had made things worse, acupuncture was too painful, and TCM had to cease due to the social distancing measures resulting from COVID-19.

> b)     The Appellant was suffering from gout, upper respiratory and urinary problems. Here, he provided evidence of medical leave given from 10 to 27 February 2020, 3 to 6 March 2020, 12 to 14 March 2020, 20 to 22 March 2020, and 9 to 11 June 2020.

> c)     The Appellant was suffering from pressure due to his maintenance obligations which he felt he was unable to comply with. He eventually sought medical attention at the Institute of Mental Health (“**IMH**”) in April 2020. He was warded from 7 to 16 April 2020 and given hospitalisation leave up till 23 April 2020. He was also certified unfit by IMH for work for the period between 17 April 2020 and 17 October 2020, producing a certificate dated 17 April 2020 (“**IMH MC**”). He also provided a medical report from IMH dated 21 August 2020 concluding that he was suffering from a Major Depressive Disorder resulting from his inability to come to terms with his divorce and the requirement to pay maintenance (“**IMH Memo**”).

7       For background, when I made Order1 on 29 January 2020, the Appellant was already experiencing the physical health issues experienced by the Appellant in (a) and (b) above. This was the reason why Order1 had provided for a reduction in maintenance for the period November 2019 to February 2020. The material change relied on by the Appellant was that these conditions had not improved, but gotten worse, and he was now suffering from mental health issues which affected his ability to work.

#### Mental Health Issues

8       I took the view that there was insufficient evidence that the Appellant was suffering from a mental condition which would prevent him from working. This was because the IMH MC stated that he was temporarily unable to work and did not need a full-time caregiver. While the IMH Memo provided some explanation of his condition, it was not verified by an affidavit deposed to by the maker of the memo. The IMH Memo was tendered to Court on the date of the hearing and it was not possible to cross-examine the maker of the memo either. Therefore, I gave limited weight to the statements in the IMH Memo.

#### Physical Health Issues

9       I found that there was a material change of circumstances as the Appellant’s physical health had not improved. His continued visits to the doctor and inability to resolve them through therapy meant that he was not able to continue working as a taxi driver for a period of time.

10     Still, I was of the view that the Appellant would be able to resume working. There were no recent medical certificates made in respect of his physical health issues. Therefore, I was only willing to grant a variation to reduce maintenance to $500.00 for a limited period, as had been previously done when Order1 was made.

11     Taking into account that it was already late August 2020, the Appellant would only be able to resume working in September 2020 at the earliest, receiving a paycheck in October 2020. Therefore, I ordered that the variation would start in March 2020, ending in October 2020, and he would resume payment of the regular maintenance sum of $1,000.00 in November 2020.

## C. ENFORCEMENT ORDER – MSS 964 of 2020

12     Having made the above orders, I determined the arrears under the Order to be $5,500.00.

13     The Appellant also relied on his physical and mental health issues to show cause as to why he was not able to make payment of the arrears. As explained above, I took the view that the Appellant could resume his maintenance obligations on 1 November 2020, and for the same reasons, he would also resume payment of the arrears on 1 November 2020. This would be in instalments of $100.00 a month on the 1st day of the month.

14     It was submitted by the Appellant’s counsel that the repayment of the arrears could be paid directly out of his share of the matrimonial proceeds in divorce proceedings – namely from the prospective sale of the matrimonial home. Parties were already in the midst of divorce proceedings, with the ancillary matters yet to be determined. The Court hearing the ancillary matters could then off-set the arrears under Order1 from the Appellant’s share of the matrimonial assets, awarding the arrears to the Respondent as her share of the matrimonial shares.

15     I took the view that it might be speculative to make such a contingency for full payment without providing for the resumption of monthly repayments. The determination of the ancillary matters may be delayed and I did not have the power to order payment of arrears out of sale proceeds under s71 of the Women’s Charter.

16     What I was able to order was that in the event that the sum due to be received by the Appellant under the sale of the matrimonial home exceeded the arrears due under this enforcement order, the Appellant would repay the sum as a single payment within 2 weeks after receiving the proceeds.

17     With my order in paragraph 13 above, this ensured that the Appellant would continue to make regular payments of the arrears, and only in the event there was an excess of sales proceeds from the division of matrimonial property, would he be required to repay the full sum.

## D. CONCLUSION

18     For the foregoing reasons, I made all the above orders.
