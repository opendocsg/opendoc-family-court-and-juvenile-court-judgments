Variation of Maintenance for Children

24 April 2019

### District Judge Jinny Tan:

## Introduction

1       Both parties have been involved in several proceedings in Singapore.

2       Both parties were originally from Pakistan.

3       There are four children to the marriage. The oldest child was born in 1999, the second child was born in 2004, the third child was born in 2008 and the youngest child was born in 2013.

4       Previously, the Plaintiff (“Mother”) filed two applications in the Family Justice Courts –

a)     OSF37/2017 – for leave to be granted to her to file an application for financial relief under section 121B of the Women’s Charter, and for interim maintenance of $3,000 to be paid by the Defendant (“Father”) for the children.

b)     OSGxxx/2017 – for joint custody, and sole care and control of the children to be granted to her.

5       I made orders on the two applications on 5 January 2018. The relevant orders I made are as follows: -

OSF37/2017

a)     I granted the Mother leave to file an application for financial relief against the Father under section 121B of the Women’s Charter;

b)     I ordered the Father to pay the sum of $1,500 per month towards maintenance for the Mother and the children on the 15th day of every month commencing 15 January 2018; and

c)     I ordered the Father to pay costs fixed at $2,500 towards the costs to the Director, Legal Aid Bureau.

OSGxxx/2017

d)     Parties shall have joint custody of the 4 children;

e)     Mother shall have care and control of the 4 children;

f)     Father shall have reasonable access to the children.

6       The Mother did not appeal against my orders in OSF37/2017 and OSGxxx/2017.

7       The Father initially appealed against my orders in OSF37/2017 (vide RAS1/2018) and OSGxxx/2017 (vide DCAxxx/2018), but later withdrew his appeal in DCAxxx/2018.

8       The Father’s appeal in RAS1/2018 was heard by Judicial Commissioner Tan Puay Boon who dismissed his appeal on 2 May 2018. The Judicial Commissioner Tan Puay Boon varied the maintenance which I had ordered, such that the sum of $1,500 was for the children only and did not include the Mother.

9       Therefore, the maintenance that the Father is to pay (based on my order and varied by the Judicial Commissioner) is $1,500 per month for the children (“Maintenance Order”)

10     On 7 November 2018, the Mother filed an application to vary the orders made in OSF37/2017 (Summons No. 3950/2018). In her application, she prayed for the following variations to be made: -

a)     Father to pay an additional sum of $2,500 towards the children’s maintenance;

b)     Father to top up the CDA account of the youngest child;

c)     Father shall pay for the tuition and enrichment classes for the 2 youngest children;

d)     Father to provide details of the elder son’s educational insurance;

e)     Father to pay for the eldest son’s tertiary education;

f)     The third child to attend joint counselling with her and/or attend the Child-In-Between (CIB) programme at DSSA with both parties; and

g)     Father to bear costs of the application.

## Orders made

11     At the hearing, the Mother withdrew her prayer for the third child to attend joint counselling and/or CIB programme.

12     In respect of the rest of the prayers, after hearing arguments by both parties, I dismissed all of them. I also ordered that each party to bear their own costs.

## Appeal

13     The Mother has now filed an appeal in relation to the orders I had made on the dismissal of all the prayers in Summons 3950/2018.

14     I therefore now give my reasons for the decision that I had made in relation to the dismissal.

## Preliminary Issues

##### Prayer 1(4) of Summons 3950/2018

15     In this Prayer, the Mother asked for the Maintenance Order to be varied to read, inter alia, for the Father to provide the details of the eldest son’s education insurance.

16     The Maintenance Order did not provide for the Father to provide details of the eldest son’s education insurance. There is therefore, nothing to vary.

17     If the Mother’s intent is for the Father to provide details of the eldest son’s education insurance, the proper application would be a discovery or interrogatory application and not a variation of the Maintenance Order.

18     Therefore, I dismissed this prayer.

##### Prayer 1(7) of Summons 3950/2018

19     In this Prayer, the Mother asked for the Maintenance Order to be varied to read, inter alia, for the Father to bear the costs of the application.

20     In OSF37/2018, I made an order for the Father to pay costs fixed at $2,500 towards the costs to the Director, Legal Aid Bureau.

21     It is therefore puzzling for the Mother to now ask for a variation of that Order, asking for the same thing i.e. for the Father to pay costs of the application.

22     If the Mother’s intention was to ask for the Father to pay costs of Sum 3950/2018, she should not have worded it to be a variation of the orders made in OSF37/2017, but rather a separate Prayer within Summons 3950/2018.

23     I therefore dismissed this prayer.

##### Prayers 1(1), (2), (3) and (5)

24     The rest of the prayers relate to the Mother’s application to increase the maintenance that the Father was paying pursuant to the Maintenance Order.

#### The Law

25     The Court’s power to vary orders for maintenance is set out in Section 118 of the Women’s Charter –

_“the court may at any time vary or rescind any subsisting order for maintenance whether secured or unsecured, on the application of the person in whose favour or of the person against whom the order was made, or, in respect of secured maintenance, of the legal representative of the latter, where it is satisfied that the order was based on any misrepresentation or mistake of fact or where there has been any material change in circumstance.”_

#### Mother’s position

26     The Mother’s position is not clear, but her affidavits can be summarised as follows: -

a)     She had been a full time housewife for 21 years. Previously the family was staying in private apartments and they had a good standard of living, but since she was kicked out of the home in December 2017, she and the children have been living in a shelter;

b)     The parties never intended the children to live in a shelter and struggle in this manner. The children deserve better than what the situation they are in now. She wants to ensure that the children are fed properly with proper vitamins and their educational needs are satisfied. She wants to be able to bring them out for entertainment and eat in moderate restaurants which will make them happy.

c)     There is a material change in circumstances because the children were living in private properties and were well taken care of by the Father. The Father used to give her $2,000 per month towards the partial household expenses and he would also pay for the utilities and other items, including the children’s expenses.

d)     She is unable to take on a permanent full time job because she needs to look after the children. She cannot hire a maid because she has no means. She cannot bring her mother or relatives to the shelter to stay and look after her children.

e)     The current maintenance that the Father is providing is not enough. She needs an additional $2,000 per month to manage the expenses and cater to the children’s needs on an interim basis.

f)     The eldest son gets an allowance of $730 from the army but this will stop next year.

g)     She was getting SSO financial assistance of $1,150 per month and $240 from MUIS, but it has since stopped because of the Maintenance Order.

h)     The third child is sitting for PSLE next year and she wants to send him for tuition classes. She stopped the classes because she could not afford.

i)     She also wishes to send the youngest son for enrichment classes. The eldest children were attending tuition and enrichment classes when the children were residing with the Father, and there is no reason for the youngest child to be deprived of these.

#### Father’s position

27     The Father’s position is that there has not been a material change in circumstances from the time the Maintenance Order was granted, which would warrant an upward variation. On the contrary, there has been a positive change in the Mother’s favour because: -

a)     The eldest child is self-sufficient;

b)     The 2nd child is staying with the Father;

c)     The Mother is now earning an income

#### Material change in circumstances?

28     From the Mother’s evidence, it is clear that she is not alleging any misrepresentation or mistake of fact.

29     The issue before the Court is whether there is any material change in circumstances which would warrant an increase in the maintenance as set out in the Maintenance Order.

30     As a starting point, any alleged material change in circumstances must occur after the Maintenance Order was made, which will then form the basis of a variation application. To raise facts which occurred prior to the making of the Maintenance Order, effectively is allowing the applicant to have a second bite of the cherry.

31     The Mother in her affidavits, has raised facts that had occurred prior to the Maintenance Order. For example, the fact that the children had a higher standard of living previously, that she and the children had been living in a shelter after she was kicked out of the matrimonial home in 1996, that the Father had provided a higher amount of maintenance for her and the children previously. These facts existed at the time when I made the Maintenance Order in January 2018.

32     Prior to me making the Maintenance Order in January 2018, the Mother had ample opportunity to raise all relevant information and arguments to support her claim for $3,000 maintenance for the children.

33     Whatever evidence in the affidavits raised by both parties, was before the Court and was considered by me when I made the Maintenance Order in January 2018.

34     While it was unfortunate that the Mother did not give a proper breakdown of the children’s expenses in the affidavits filed then, prior to me making the order in January 2018, the Mother cannot now ask this Court to re-examine the circumstances that were in existence prior to January 2018 to seek a variation of the Maintenance Order.

35     Even if the Mother was of the view that the sum of $1,500 (as per the Maintenance Order) was insufficient for the children’s needs, the Mother did not file any appeal.

36     Therefore, it would appear (from both parties’ affidavits) that the changes in circumstances after the Maintenance Order was made, would be these: -

a)     The eldest son is now serving National Service and is receiving an allowance;

b)     The second son is staying with the Father

c)     The Mother has stopped receiving financial assistance; and

d)     The Mother has some income.

37     The eldest son is 19 years old, and is now in the army. According to the Mother, the son gets an allowance of $730, and he is using this to pay for his own expenses and sometimes, the Mother borrows from him[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1). The son, himself, filed an affidavit, confirming that his allowance, and that if he is left with any balance, he passes to his mother to help with the household expenses. He sometimes buys groceries and give money to his younger brothers[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2).

38     The Mother in her Reply Affidavit, reiterates that the eldest son is providing for the family by giving her money he can save out of his allowance[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3).

39     There is therefore a positive change in the Mother’s circumstances because not only is the eldest son not relying on her to pay for his own expenses, he is also helping out financially with the family’s expenses.

40     The Mother has been granted care and control of all four children, following the orders made by me in OSGxxx/2017.

41     According to the Mother, the 2nd son now shuttles between the Father’s residence and the shelter where she lives[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4). In the same affidavit, she admits that the Father bears the 2nd son’s expenses[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5).

42     Since the Father is now bearing the 2nd son’s expenses, the sum of $1,500 (which the Father’s contribution towards the 4 children’s maintenance) can now to be used to pay for the expenses of 2 children (the 3rd and the 4th children) instead of 4 children.

43     Again, this is a positive change in the Mother’s circumstances.

44     The Mother was receiving financial assistance of $1150/month from MSF and $240 from MUIS[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6). From the documents produced by the Mother, the financial assistance from MSF stopped on 30 April 2018[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7). The financial assistance from MUIS was reduced to $160/month in July 2018 and stopped completely by September 2018[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8).

45     The Mother’s counsel tendered two documents at the hearing – one was a letter from MSF dated 14 May 2018 and another dated 7 November 2018[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9), which were subsequently exhibited in the Mother’s counsel’s affidavit filed 1 April 2019. In the two letters tendered, MSF explained the reason the financial assistance has stopped and noted that the eldest son had been enlisted since February 2018 and receiving a regular monthly allowance. MSF also stated in the letter of 14 May 2018:-

_“we note that the household’s net income is sufficient for your household’s basic expenses”_

46     It therefore would appear that the Mother now receives $1,390 less what she had previously received at the time the Maintenance Order was made.

47     Since the Maintenance Order was made, the Mother has been receiving some income. In her Reply Affidavit, she states that she is working part-time at a childcare as a relief teacher assistant, earning $7 per hour. She exhibited documents to show that she was employed as a freelance ops assistant for the period April 2018 to May 2018, and paid $1,500[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10). In October 2018 she received CPF contributions from a company known as xxx Pte[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11).

48     She is also attending some course to upgrade her skills[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12). This means that she will have an increased earning capacity once her skills are upgraded.

49     This shows that the Mother does have some source of income to supplement the maintenance contributed by the Father. This again, is a positive change in the Mother’s circumstances.

50     While the Mother says she is suffering from back and knee pain and plantar fasciitis, there is no evidence to say that she is unable to work as a result of her medical condition. Moreover, there is no evidence also to show that this medical condition occurred after the Maintenance Order had been made.

51     Taking all these changes into consideration, on the whole, it would appear that the Mother’s circumstances have improved slightly compared to the time when the Maintenance Order was made: -

a)     When the Maintenance Order was made, the Mother was receiving $1,500 from the Father and $1,390 from MSF and MUIS. This meant that she received the sum of $2,890 to pay for 4 children’s expenses (i.e. each child would have the benefit of $722.50).

b)     Now, the Mother is receiving $1,500 from the Father, some income on her own and she only needs to pay for 2 children’s expenses. This means that each child would have the benefit of $750.

52     Therefore, it appears that there is no material change to the Mother’s detriment that would warrant an upward variation of the Maintenance Order.

53     Accordingly, I dismissed the Mother’s prayers 1(1), (2) and (3) of Summons 3950/2018.

54     In relation to the Mother’s prayers for the Father to pay for the eldest son’s tertiary education, I also dismissed it. This is because based on the current situation, the eldest son has not incurred such expenses. If the expenses had not been incurred, there is no material change in circumstances which will warrant a variation of the maintenance upwards.

55     The son is still in National Service. Even in his own affidavit, there is no estimate of the costs to be incurred[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13).

56     It is therefore premature for the Mother to use this as a basis for an upward variation of the Maintenance Order.

#### “Good Cause”?

57     The Mother’s counsel at the hearing, argued that the Court can vary the maintenance if “_other good cause_” can be shown to the satisfaction of the Court. This was never raised in her Written Submissions and was raised only orally at the hearing.

58     The “good cause” the Mother submits is that the Court should consider what is good for the children, because the 3rd child requires tuition and that the children have no other entertainment and are staying in a shelter.

59     The Mother’s counsel also submitted that she was relying on Section 127 of the Women’s Charter to ask for a variation of the Maintenance Order.

60     Section 127 of the Women’s Charter does not appear to be applicable here. Section 127 gives the Court the power to order a parent to pay maintenance for his child “_during the pendency of any matrimonial proceedings or when granting or at any time subsequent to the grant of a judgment of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage.”_ Here, an order for maintenance has been granted, and the Mother is seeking a variation of that order. This is not a fresh application for maintenance.

61     The phrase “_good cause”_ is found in Section 72 of the Women’s Charter. Section 72 provides as follows: -

_“On the application of any person receiving or ordered to pay a monthly allowance under this Part and on proof of a change in the circumstances of that person, or that person’s wife, incapacitated husband or child, or for other good cause being shown to the satisfaction of the court, the court by which the order was made may rescind the order or may vary it as it thinks fit.”_

62     The Mother’s counsel again, appears to have relied on the wrong provisions.

63     Section 72 deals with maintenance orders that had been made under Part VIII of the Women’s Charter. The Maintenance Order obtained was not made pursuant to Part VIII of the Women’s Charter (in particular Section 69 of the Women’s Charter). Moreover, an application made under Section 72 is made by way of a Magistrate’s complaint and not via a summons. There is therefore a procedural error if the Mother wishes to rely on Section 72.

64     Even if Section 72 is applicable here, there are no authorities brought forth by the Mother on what would constitute “_good cause”_, and there are no precedents which can persuade this Court to find that the situation here falls squarely within the definition of “_good cause”_.

65     In the case of _TCG v. TCH[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14)_, the court found that the husband’s relocation to Shanghai constituted good cause to vary the terms of the consent order. The husband’s relocation meant that it would be impractical for him to continue managing the finances of the family, and this was good cause to vary the consent order to provide that the husband was to pay a global sum each month for the wife to manage payments to the third parties.

66     Here, what the Mother says are “_good cause”_ are circumstances which the Court had already taken into consideration when the Maintenance Order at the first instance. The Mother and the children were staying at the shelter then. There has not been a change in their accommodation arrangements. Moreover, the 3rd child did not have tuition then and is still not receiving tuition now. The costs of tuition have not been incurred. Moreover, there is no evidence to show that the child is in dire need to receive tuition.

67     For the reasons above, I therefore dismissed the Mother’s application, save for one prayer which she withdrew.

68     As the Mother did not succeed in her application, and she is legally aided, I ordered that each party to bear their own costs.
