19 June 2020 - Judgment Reserved

### District Judge Tan Shin Yi:

## BACKGROUND

1       The majority of divorce proceedings in Singapore are uncontested. Nevertheless, a minority of contested cases are extremely acrimonious and take up a large part of the Court’s time and resources. This was one such case.

2       The parties in the proceedings were married on 3 November 2012 in the United States of America. At the time, the Plaintiff husband (referred to as “the Father”), a British citizen, was living and working in Singapore. The Defendant wife (referred to as “the Mother”), an American citizen, was living and working in the US. The Mother subsequently moved to Singapore to join the Father sometime in August 2013, and started working in Singapore. The Mother underwent In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) treatments and eventually became pregnant with their child, a boy, who was born in March 2017 (referred to as “N”). N is an American citizen and, at the time of hearing, is 3 years old.

3       Sometime in late 2017, the Mother discovered that the Father had engaged in a string of sustained sexual encounters, with both men and women, throughout the marriage. Despite this, the parties attempted to reconcile and the Mother went through two further unsuccessful IVF treatments. The marriage eventually broke down irretrievably and the Father moved out of their shared home in May 2018. He also commenced divorce proceedings against the Mother on 5 July 2018. The Mother filed her Counterclaim for divorce on 15 August 2018.

4       On 7 August 2018, the Mother filed a Summons application for care and control of N, as well as for leave to relocate N to the US. On 21 September 2018, the Father filed a cross-application for care and control of N. Thereafter, the Father also filed an application against the Mother under the Protection from Harassment Act (“POHA”), and the Mother applied for a Personal Protection Order (“PPO”) against the Father. During the proceedings, the Mother also filed several Summons applications for permission to take various overseas trips with N.

5       The case was docketed to me in late 2018 and the parties were strongly encouraged to resolve their issues for the sake of their young child. After the parties completed compulsory counselling and mediation at the Child Focused Resolution Centre (“CFRC”) and no resolution was reached, they attended private mediation before Ms Angelina Hing on 2 occasions in February and March 2019. Pursuant to the private mediation, the parties managed to reach a partial agreement regarding interim arrangements for N. This led to the withdrawal of the parties’ respective applications for an order under the POHA and for a PPO. In February, the parties also agreed that the Mother would hold off her relocation plans with N for 2 years, provided that she continued to remain employed in Singapore.

6       On 12 April 2019, a consent order was recorded wherein N would reside with the Mother in the interim and the Father would have access to N 3 times a week (with no overnight access), pending further order. The order also provided for the Father to continue paying for certain expenses for the Mother and N, including interim maintenance of $3,400 per month, the monthly rental for the River Valley apartment where N and the Mother reside, the utilities and services for the said apartment, and N’s school fees.

7       Unfortunately, the Mother was made redundant and was terminated from her job. Given the change in the Mother’s employment status, she resurrected her application for leave to relocate to the US with N. The Mother’s application for leave to relocate with N and for the Father to pay maintenance for both herself and N was filed on 3 May 2019 (SUM No. 1496/2019). The Father responded by filing an application to strike out or stay the Mother’s application for relocation (SUM No. 1807/2019), on the basis that there was “no urgency” for any relocation and that the Mother’s application was taken out “in bad faith” in an attempt to block access between the Father and N.

8       The parties eventually agreed that the divorce would proceed uncontested and on 29 April 2019, the Interim Judgment was granted based on the Mother’s Counterclaim. Both parties then filed their Affidavits of Assets and Means in June 2019 for the ancillary matters. Sometime in June 2019, the Father also lost his job in Singapore and became unemployed. In December 2019, the Father obtained a 3-month contract job with a consultancy firm. This was followed by a permanent job with an American bank in Singapore, which commenced sometime in December 2019. At the time of hearing, the Mother is still unemployed although she had previously been in talks with some potential employers located in the US.

## THE APPOINTMENT OF AN EXPERT PSYCHOLOGIST

9       The child-related issues, the Mother’s application for leave to relocate (SUM No. 1496/2019) and the Father’s application to strike out or stay the Mother’s application (SUM No. 1807/2019) were first heard by me on 3 October 2019. On 28 February 2020, as the issue of relocation was already being heard with the ancillary matters, I made no orders on the Father’s application to strike out or stay the Mother’s application (SUM No. 1807/2019) and adjourned the issue of costs to the hearing of the Mother’s application and the ancillary matters.

10     At the hearing on 3 October 2019, both parties advanced arguments regarding the other party’s alleged mental and emotional condition. The Father claimed that the Mother was abusive and violent, and the Mother claimed that the Father was a sex addict and a sexual deviant. Both alleged that the other’s “condition” would have a negative impact on the child and the child would be placed at risk; and sought that the other party be examined by a psychologist.

11     The Father even saw a clinical psychologist, one Dr A. Ng, and obtained a report from her, dated 10 April 2018, which stated that the Mother “appears to suffer from emotional dysregulation, where there is marked emotional reactivity to triggers”[^1] and suggested that the Mother undergo a psychological assessment, _even though the psychologist had never met nor examined the Mother._ The Father informed the Court that he was willing to submit himself for assessment by a medical professional to prove that he was not a sexual deviant, as alleged by the Mother.

12     I ordered an expert report to be prepared by a psychologist, to be agreed/nominated by both parties, on the specific issue of whether the Father’s sexual habits/lifestyle would affect his ability to be N’s caregiver and whether it would have any adverse effect on N in the time spent with the Father. The evidence submitted on the Father’s preferred sexual lifestyle was graphic and voluminous, spanning the period 2013-2017, and included evidence of what the Mother considered to be “sexually deviant” behaviour including “fisting”, “anal sex”, bisexual sex and “voyeurism sex” which suggested a compulsive sexual addiction. Although the Father is a grown adult who is free to make his own choices, I was concerned about the negative impact of his lifestyle on N, should N be in the care of the Father.

13     I did not order that the Mother be examined by a psychologist as I was of the view that the allegations regarding the Mother did not indicate any threat or danger to N. There was also no allegation that the Mother had ever been violent or abusive towards N. I was satisfied that the Mother’s behaviour was situational and caused by the Mother’s emotional state upon discovery of the Father’s various sexual liaisons over a sustained and extended period of time, the hormonal imbalances caused by the IVF procedures and her father’s deterioration in health and subsequent death. I was also satisfied that the Mother’s conduct was not indicative of any serious mental condition or disorder which may impact N. Further, most of the Father’s complaints regarding incidents of violence by the Mother towards him began only after the discovery of his infidelities and lasted until he moved out of their home some 8 months later. This suggested that the Mother’s “violent” reactions towards the Father were a result of the extreme emotional stresses she was under.

14     The Father also sought overnight access to N in the interim, and I ordered that the Father have overnight access to N once a week for 4 weeks starting 7 October 2019, with certain measures in place, for example: (i) that the Father was to be with N at all times; and (ii) no third party was to be present during the access. At the Mother’s request, the Father also agreed to purchase a web camera, to be placed in the room where N slept, and the Mother was given access to the web feed.

15     Subsequently, as the parties could not agree on the psychologist to be appointed and the terms of reference, they wrote in to Court and I convened a case conference on 30 October 2019. I appointed a psychologist chosen from the parties’ seven nominations, Dr M. Woo (“Dr Woo”). Dr Woo’s curriculum vitae showed that he had over 19 years’ professional experience and he specialised in treating addictions. He also had experience testifying in court as an expert witness.

16     On 21 November 2019, I heard the parties on the Father’s request for continued overnight access to N. The Mother objected to any further overnight access, pending the submission of Dr Woo’s report. I ordered that pending the submission of the report, the Father was to continue to have overnight access once a week and day access twice a week. I also ordered the Mother to select and make an appointment with a psychologist or counsellor who specialised in co-parenting issues. The Mother eventually saw Ms J. Koh, a counsellor from REACH Community Services, for one session.

### The psychologist’s report dated 11 February 2020

17     Dr Woo’s report was furnished to the Court and to parties on 11 February 2020. The report indicated that the Father’s assessment suggested a “schizoid and turbulent”[^2] personality style, and that the Father “endorsed a number of psychological symptoms that may indicate a tendency to avoid self-disclosure” with “isolative tendencies in which he holds to strong beliefs of entitlement and/or goal-directed behavior not easily understood by those around him”. The Father also “expressed a certain level of entitlement about his supposed ‘sexually deviant’ behaviour, with expectations of little or no repercussions”[^3] as he considered them to be between “consenting partners” whom he had mostly sourced through advertisement on Craig’s List or adult websites. There was also “little talk or dialogue about remorse or regret” from the Father regarding his infidelities.

18     Dr Woo’s assessment of the Father was that while he enjoyed his sexual encounters, this did “not translate to behaviours that are sexually addictive or impulsive” or “sexually deviant”[^4]. However, the Father displayed a “certain level of entitlement and narcissim” in his mindset and Dr Woo acknowledged that it was possible for the Father to “communicate values of ‘being able to get away with sexual infidelities as long as it is a paid transaction’ in his interactions with”[^5] N.

19     Dr Woo’s recommendations were that the co-parenting arrangements and counselling address concerns of addressing responsibility and fidelities in a marriage relationship; and to follow through these concerns, the Father (i) cannot expose N to the range of arousal triggers that he has had access to, and (ii) needs to be careful in his communication with N, and “not convey that a commercially transacted straightforward sexual encounter between willing parties is acceptable within the confines of a marriage relationship”. As long as the Father was “careful and diligent” with the points in (i) and (ii) in “an environment of accountability and supervision”[^6], Dr Woo considered him suitable for caregiver responsibility.

20     After Dr Woo rendered his report, the Mother emailed him privately to inform him that he had “left out” certain details about the Father’s past[^7] which might influence his report. The Mother’s solicitors also sent a letter to Dr Woo on 14 February 2020. On 28 February 2020, I ordered that neither party was to correspond directly with Dr Woo as he had already rendered his report and there was no pending application from either party regarding cross-examination of Dr Woo or clarification of his report.

## CUSTODY CARE AND CONTROL

21     The issues relating to custody, care and control of N and relocation are inextricably linked. In the event that the Mother is granted care and control of N, the question then arises whether she should be allowed to relocate with N. In the event that the Father is granted care and control of N, the issue of relocation does not arise. It is clear however that the paramount consideration of the Court in determining such issues is the _best interests_ of the child.

## Custody

22     The Mother was initially agreeable to joint custody with the Father, however, she subsequently changed her position and sought sole custody[^8] instead. Alternatively, if both parties had joint custody, the Mother wanted (i) the right to make decisions on N’s education if both parties could not agree on the same; and (ii) a permanent injunction restraining the Father from making any application regarding N’s citizenship/permanent residency of any country without the Mother’s prior written consent.

23     It is trite law that no custody or joint custody should be ordered unless there are _exceptional_ circumstances justifying a sole custody order. Such exceptional circumstances could include physical, sexual or emotional abuse of a child by one parent, or where cooperation between the parties is impossible and the lack of cooperation is harmful to the child. This was to “ensure that neither parent has a better right over the child and that both have a responsibility to bring the child up in the best way possible” and to “promote joint parenting so that both parents could continue to have a direct involvement in the child’s life”, which was in the welfare of the child: \[38\] and \[26\] of _CX v. CY_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 3 SLR(R) 690</span>.

24     Even if the parents’ relationship is so acrimonious that they cannot see eye-to-eye on issues relating to the child, that is not a good enough reason to justify a sole custody order. In _AMB v. AMC_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 169</span>, the High Court found that there was a distinction between granting a sole custody order “on the basis of acrimony and one in which parties are unable to cooperate with each other”[^9]. It was clarified that where there was a lack of communication due to the acrimonious relationship between the parties, this was not sufficient for the grant of a sole custody order. For a sole custody order to be made, the parties must have shown first that they had indeed tried to work together in the child’s best interests but failed.

25     In the present case, I did not see any exceptional circumstances that warranted a departure from the general position of ordering joint or no custody and I thus order that both parties shall have joint custody of N. I did not make any orders regarding who should have the final say in the event that parties could not agree on matters of education, or on restraining the Father from making an application regarding N’s citizenship or permanent residency as I felt that these were issues which _both_ parties should discuss and decide jointly if they arose. Further, the orders made below would also clarify the immediate issue of the country where N is to reside.

## Care and Control

26     The paramount consideration is and always will be the child’s welfare. In _ABW v. ABV_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 769</span>, which concerned a tussle over the care and control of two young children, it was stated that the concept of “welfare” of a child was to be considered in the widest sense and could not be measured by money or physical comfort only[^10]. What was in the best interests of any particular child depended on the circumstances of the individual case and the individual child. A number of relevant circumstances should be taken into account, being (i) the stability or continuity of arrangements; (ii) the need for both parents to have an involvement in the child’s life; (iii) which parent shows the greater concern for the child; (iv) the maternal bond; (v) the child’s wishes; and (vi) the desirability of keeping siblings together.

#### Shared care and control

27     The Father suggested that both parties have shared care and control of N while the Mother insisted on sole care and control. Shared care and control may seem like an ideal situation where both parents get roughly equal time with the child, but the reality is that such an arrangement is generally difficult to implement, and is only workable and truly in the best interests of a child when both parents are able to co-parent effectively and work together towards a common goal: that of the child’s welfare. While this does not mean that the parties have to be of like mind in every aspect of the child’s life, it does necessitate that they are able to communicate regularly in a civil and calm manner; and are able to discuss issues relating to the child, without escalating into a quarrel or violent dispute.

28     Moreover, shared care and control is not ideal in a situation where both parents have vastly different parenting styles. It was recognised in _AQL v. AQM_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 840</span> that when a child is very young, “a strong clash in parenting styles” was relevant in considering shared care and control as a young child would be “_considerably stressed if forced to adapt to different expectations and approaches every few days. Such strain cannot be beneficial at such an early stage in the child’s development_”[^11]. Further, a child of N’s age required constancy and stability in his daily routine and activities, and it would not be in his interest to be uprooted every few days or every week, to a new home. A child would not feel secure in being made to “move house” often, even if it is only between two households.

29     In the present case, it was clear that both parties had an acrimonious relationship and extremely different parenting styles. From May to June 2019, there were incidents between the parties when the Father was accused of[^12] not feeding N properly during access, causing N to have “issues with the toilet” when potty-training; or of allowing N to swim on “overcast and chilly” days[^13] and causing him to catch a cold; and using a forward-facing, instead of rear-facing, car seat[^14]. Many letters were exchanged between the parties’ solicitors during this period. The Mother also told the Father not to give N “baths instead of showers” as this may “ingrain” in N “the normalcy of taking baths, which heightens the risk of a urinary tract infection”[^15]. The Mother’s parenting style emphasised structure, control and routine; whereas the Father’s was more laidback and focused on having fun with N.

30     It was also recognised in _BNS v. BNT_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 213</span> that hostility between the parties may militate against a shared care and control order because it may result in practical difficulties with its execution on a day-to-day basis and create stress for the children at the centre of the tussle. An unworkable order would also likely result in the parties returning to court to litigate on that order. Further, a shared care and control order could not, in and of itself, create behavioural and mind-set changes necessary for the parties to co-parent well.

31     Shared care and control, in some cases, may be an artificial attempt to recreate a “whole” family unit for the child without taking into account the realities of divorce – that divorce means the family unit is no longer intact. The reality is that now there are two households, frequently a distance apart, in which the head of each household is no longer bound to accept the wishes of the other. In an intact family, both parents may compromise and work together to assume different roles in child-rearing, often ceding some responsibilities to the other parent yet acknowledging that each has their own part to play in the child’s life. This is usually not the case when parties are divorced, especially when the divorce is an acrimonious one and there is a distinct element of “fault” on the part of one party. In my view, it does more harm to a child’s welfare when a child has to split his/her time equally between two parents who cannot even stand to be in the same room together, and would result in the child being triangulated between both parents. As such, I do not think this a suitable case for shared care and control.

#### The parties’ suitability as caregivers

32     Both parties claimed to be N’s primary caregiver. It is however undisputed that N has been in the sole care and control of the Mother for the past two years (since the Father left the parties’ home in May 2018), even though the Father argues that this was not a situation that he consented to.

33     It is also undisputed that the Mother has put in place a fixed and stable routine for N in her care, and that N is thriving and happy. Even after the breakdown of the marriage, the Father also acknowledged that the Mother played an important role in caring for N and in establishing his routine[^16], breastfeeding him when he was a baby, selecting his meals and classes and playdates. In the consent order dated 12 April 2019, the Father had also agreed to the Mother continuing to have interim care and control of N. The Mother was also closely involved in N’s daily activities and details of the same, as evidenced when she shared a detailed meal plan with the Father[^17], via solicitors, so he could refer to the plan during his access with N. I had no doubt that she is a good mother who loves N very much and takes pains to ensure his physical, emotional and mental wellbeing.

34     Much was said about the Father being constantly “badgered” and “harassed”[^18] by the Mother in the aftermath of the breakdown of the marriage. The Father claimed that the Mother had sent him “more than 15,000 messages in the 45 days”[^19] after he left the matrimonial home. The Father also claimed that there were various “red flags”[^20] regarding the Mother’s behaviour prior to the marriage that he should have “paid heed to” but did not out of “infatuation” for the Mother. He raised the examples of the Mother’s “inability to regulate or control her temper”[^21], the “occasions of violence”[^22] against him and her “vindictiveness” to support his position that the Mother’s behaviour had a “damaging” effect on those around her, including N, and that the Mother was therefore an unsuitable caregiver for N.

35     I accepted the Mother’s explanation that she had behaved that way at the material time because she was confronted with real evidence of the Father’s infidelities with both men and women, and she also had a new baby to care for. N was around six months of age when the Mother found evidence of the Father’s affairs in September 2017. The evidence showed that the Father’s indiscretions had started as early as six months into the parties’ marriage, and continued with regularity throughout the marriage. The Mother stated that she found out that even when she was undergoing various rounds of IVF, the Father had placed advertisements online seeking casual sex partners[^23]. The Mother also found videos of the Father engaging in unnatural sex acts with a male prostitute. At the same time, the Mother’s father was dying and eventually passed away; and the Mother had undergone 2 further rounds of IVF treatment which were unsuccessful. After the parties’ attempted reconciliation fell through, the Father then filed for divorce against the Mother. Given the circumstances, I was of the view that the Mother’s actions at the time were situational and borne out of the immense stress and trauma she was under, and did not affect her suitability as primary caregiver for N.

36     It is also my finding that the Father would **not** be a suitable caregiver for N. Dr Woo’s report stated that in order for the Father to be suitable for caregiving responsibility, the Father would have to be “careful and diligent” in (i) ensuring that N was not exposed to certain arousal triggers; and (ii) in his communication with N regarding values of paid sexual infidelities _in “an environment of accountability and supervision”_. These arousal triggers include “_stimuli in the domains of voyeurism, bestiality and prostitution_[^24]_”._ Dr Woo also acknowledged that it was possible for the Father to still “communicate values of ‘being able to get away with sexual infidelities as long as it is a paid transaction’ in his interactions with”[^25] N.

37     It is clear from Dr Woo’s report that in granting the Father care of N, specific boundaries would have to be put in place in order to ensure that N does not grow up exposed to the same sexual arousal triggers as the Father; and this would require the Father to be held accountable for, and be supervised in, his care of N. It was simply not practicable to put N in the care of the Father and expect someone else to exercise constant supervision over the Father. I did **not** accept the Father’s interpretation that this meant instead that the Father would have to be “accountable to, and exercise supervision over”[^26], N. Dr Woo’s report also indicated that the Father exhibits “isolative tendencies”[^27] and he has few close relationships with people other than his family. This suggests that the Father does not have a strong social network in Singapore.

38     What is also worrying is that the Father expressed a “level of entitlement” about his sexually promiscuous lifestyle, and does not appear to take responsibility for his actions. Instead, he expects the Mother to “recover” from the divorce[^28] and move on without significant consequence or repercussions. While Dr Woo’s report indicated that the Father was not engaging in behaviours that were considered “sexually deviant”, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual – 5th edition (better known as the “DSM-5”), this did not render such behaviour in any way normal.

39     N is a vulnerable young child and it is the duty of this Court to make orders in N’s best interests that would also ensure that N is protected from harm. Based on the evidence, I am of the view that there is a real risk of N being exposed to the wrong values and behaviour, or worse, exposed to complete strangers who are the Father’s casual sex partners, if he is placed in the Father’s care. I emphasise that I do not find that the Father is not or cannot be a good father to N; I have no doubt he loves N very much and wants the best for him. However, given the Father’s beliefs and choices, there is a very real possibility that he may also impart the same values and choices to N, whether consciously or unconsciously. The principles, values and choices imparted to N would mould the kind of person he eventually grows up to be.

#### Stability and continuity of living arrangements

40     The Father is a British national and has been in Singapore for the past 8 years. In early 2019, he had initially expressed uncertainty about remaining in Singapore for the long-term[^29]. In May 2019, after the Father received notice that he would lose his job, he applied for N to become a British citizen and obtained a British passport for him, indicating that he intended to return to the UK. The Father also stated in his Affidavit of Assets and Means[^30] that he intended for N to return to the UK when he is much older. However, after the Mother’s application for relocation was filed, the Father changed his position and stated that he wanted N and himself to “put down roots”[^31] in Singapore for the long-term. He claimed that after he applied for Permanent Residency in Singapore, he would do the same for N. I would note however that as at the time of hearing, no evidence of any such application had been made, even though the Father claimed to have engaged an immigration specialist to prepare such an application.

41     It cannot be over-stated that young children require constancy and stability in their routines and their lives. The life of an expatriate family moving every few years from country to country may be exciting and fulfilling for adults, but for young children, it may be difficult for them to accept and to adjust to such a nomadic lifestyle. If care and control is with the Mother and relocation is allowed, N would be raised and grow up in the US, where he is also a citizen. If care and control is with the Father, given the Father’s uncertain plans regarding the long-term and his lack of ties with Singapore, if the Father’s employment in Singapore were to be terminated, it is uncertain where N may end up residing.

42     In the circumstances, for the above reasons, I order that the Mother is to have care and control of N. I will elaborate on the access orders below, after dealing with the issue of relocation.

## RELOCATION

43     In relocation applications, the fundamental and critical legal principle on which everything depends is that the welfare of the child is **paramount** and this principle ought to override any other consideration[^32]. The Court of Appeal in _BNS v. BNT_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 973</span> also found that while the reasonable wishes of the primary caregiver to relocate was an important factor when determining what is best for the welfare of the child, such wishes were relevant “_only to the extent_ that it is found that there will be a transference of his/her insecurity and negative feelings onto the child”[^33] if the relocation is not granted. After all, the law expects parents to put the interests of the children before their own[^34].

44     It is widely acknowledged that in general, a child would benefit from continuing to have a meaningful relationship with both parents, which does not cease to be true simply because the marriage has broken down. Therefore, another important factor to consider in relocation applications, which must be balanced against the reasonable wishes of the primary caregiver, is the child’s loss of relationship with the left-behind parent. Generally speaking, the impact on the child’s welfare in the event of relocation being allowed would be greater if the child already had a strong existing bond with the left-behind parent[^35]. It was emphasised in _BNS v. BNT_ that we must distinguish between the “trauma and harm to a child arising from the _loss_ of a close relationship and the benefits of _building_ a relationship with both parents” and where the loss of such a relationship may mean greater harm to a child, this “may not justify the sacrifice”[^36].

45     It was also briefly acknowledged in an earlier case on relocation, _AZB v. AYZ_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 627</span>, that a relocation application would generally be granted _unless_ it can be shown that to deprive the child of meaningful contact with the left-behind parent would be “so detrimental as to negate the benefits to the child from having the primary caregiver’s emotional and psychological needs taken care of”[^37]. This is consistent with the principle that the welfare of the child is often inextricably intertwined with the general well-being and happiness of the primary caregiver that the court is loath to interfere with important life decisions of the primary caregiver, so long as they are reasonably made and are not against the interests of the child[^38].

## The Father’s initial agreement to the relocation

46     It was not disputed that sometime after the breakdown of the marriage, the parties had agreed that the Mother and N would relocate together to the US. Until July 2018, the Father actively participated in assisting the Mother in the relocation process[^39]: he obtained quotes from movers for the relocation and had also paid half the rental for July and August 2018 for an apartment in Florida, US. The Father even sourced for a job in the US and had several meetings for a position in Ernst & Young, but this fell through[^40].

47     The Father explained that at the time, he was so “ridden with guilt”[^41] over his infidelities that he was pressured into doing everything the Mother wanted in order to save the marriage. He also maintained that his understanding was that the entire family would relocate to the US together. However, the contemporaneous exchange of text messages between the parties in May and June 2018 gave the impression that the Father had indeed agreed that the Mother and N should return to the US without him.

48     Based on the numerous text messages exchanged in May 2018, the Mother had begged the Father to book flight tickets for her and N to move to the US and the Father had agreed to let them go. The Mother told the Father that she was “_broken_” and a “_wreck_” [^42] by what he had done and was “_begging… let us go_”. The Father’s response was “_I don’t want you to go but I won’t try and make you stay._[^43]”; and “_I won’t stop you or \[N\] leaving_”. Even in June 2018, the Father had sent messages to the Mother regarding his proposed access to N after the relocation:

> _“In all likelihood I would be there for a week so would like to see him for 2 overnights and, to some degree, every day – depending on his schedule etc._ [^44] _”_

> _“You have care and control with me having reasonable access. One weekend every six weeks if I’m in Asia. Every other weekend if I’m in United States (or United Kingdom), $4500 USD a month for support/maintenance etc (basically all-in)._ [^45] ”

After divorce proceedings were commenced and the relationship between the parties deteriorated further, the Father changed his mind and contested the relocation.

49     The Father’s objection to relocation is that relocation would result in the loss of his relationship with N due to the Mother’s “gatekeeping, hostility and aggression”[^46] towards the Father. The examples given of the Mother’s behaviour are that[^47] she (i) imposed “unreasonable restrictions and conditions” on the Father’s access; (ii) prevented the Father from organising activities for N or arranging his schedule; and (iii) “consistently nit-picks” on the Father’s decisions for N. Based on this, the Father submits that there is a “high likelihood”[^48] that the Mother will alienate N from the Father if she is allowed to relocate to the US with him.

50     The main issue I had to consider was whether relocating N would result in such a loss of his relationship with the Father that it justified sacrificing the Mother’s (and possibly N’s) wellbeing in forcing her to remain in Singapore. As stated in the case law on relocation, it is clear that this is a balancing exercise between the wishes and wellbeing (provided that the decision to relocate is reasonable) of the primary caregiver and the potential loss of relationship between the child and the left-behind parent.

## Is the Mother’s desire to relocate reasonable and in N’s welfare?

51     There is no doubt that the parties have no current real link to Singapore, other than that the Father is employed here and that N was born here. The Mother is an American citizen, the Father is a British citizen, and N holds both American and British citizenship. It was not disputed that the Mother had come to Singapore in 2013 to be with the Father who was working here, and the Father himself had previously admitted that in the long-term, he is unsure if he will remain in Singapore or return to the UK[^49]. When the Mother first relocated to Singapore after the parties married, the indication was that their stay in Singapore was transient and not permanent, as evidenced in the Father’s letter to her, stating that they would “_exploit the Singapore opportunities as much as possible – good quality of life, good job opps \[sic\] and \[a\] chance to put some money away_[^50]”. The Mother and N both continue to remain in Singapore on a Social Visit Pass and Dependent’s Pass respectively, and the Mother’s SVP cannot be indefinitely extended.

52     In the current economic climate, with many countries all over the world, including Singapore, being hit with the devastating effects of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (“COVID19”), I recognise that it may be tenuous for the Mother to find employment in Singapore and in the US. However, if she returns to the US, as a citizen, she can at least obtain some relief in the form of unemployment benefits while she looks for employment. As a foreigner in Singapore, she cannot avail herself of any relief packages or pay-outs provided by the government. The Mother also cannot conduct any trading activities using her investment accounts in the US while she continues to reside in Singapore, due to the restrictions imposed by the IRS. Due to the effects of COVID19 on companies in Singapore and the sharp spike in the unemployment rate, the Mother’s fears that she is unemployable in Singapore (being a foreigner here on a short-term Visit Pass) are not unfounded.

53     The Mother has also stated that it has been “difficult” for her to be “socially isolated” in Singapore[^51], where the culture is very different from that in the US, especially when she has no close friends or family in Singapore to provide her with support during an extremely tough time in her life. This was especially after she was made redundant and no longer had the support of her colleagues. In the US, she has her mother, brother and cousins, as well as old friends whom she can rely on. It is also not disputed that the Mother had moved to Singapore to be with the Father; and now that the marriage is over and the Mother is no longer employed in Singapore, it is indeed reasonable for her to want to return to the US.

54     N is only 3 years old and is too young to have formed an established social network of his own in Singapore. Indeed, as the Mother has pointed out, many of his friends are also the children of expatriates who have since moved away from Singapore. In the US, he will be able to settle down in school and make friends with the children who will hopefully go on to the same middle and high schools as him, and he will enjoy the care and support of his maternal grandmother, uncles and aunts and cousins around him. More importantly, it will be a stable and secure environment for him where he will not have to worry about adapting to a new country or living environment every few years. I have no doubt that relocation would also be in N’s best interests.

## Would relocation result in the loss of the relationship between N and the Father?

55     Part of Dr Woo’s report dealt with his interview with the Mother, in which the Mother had “made it clear” that she did not begrudge the Father access to N as his father; but she was worried about N “accessing content that is sexually deviant”[^52] when he is with the Father. Such fears are not unfounded given the circumstances of the case. The Father’s submission is that the Mother will alienate N from him as she had (i) previously threatened to cut him out of N’s life and taint N’s perception of him[^53]; and (ii) continued to display “hostility and aggression” towards the Father, even in N’s presence[^54]. Notably, however, the messages sent by the Mother threatening this were all sent in May-June 2018[^55], at the time that proceedings were first commenced and shortly after the Mother found out about the Father’s infidelities. The Father himself has accepted that some of the Mother’s actions occurred at the time when the Mother had been going through an extremely low point in her life. He alleges, however, that the Mother continues to behave in the same way currently, as she has insisted on all communication going through solicitors[^56], refused to agree to engaging a Parenting Coordinator and continues to accuse the Father of being a “sexual deviant”.

56     Before divorce proceedings were commenced by the Father in July 2018, the messages exchanged between the parties regarding discussion on the Mother’s relocation to the US with N seemed cordial enough. I have already set out some examples of such messages above. The Mother also suggested that the Father should consider N’s birthday and holiday access after the relocation[^57]: “_What about his birthday and holidays?_”, to which the Father responded “_Can I have an out of cycle visit for his birthday?_” Parties then discussed the sharing of Christmas and Thanksgiving holidays:

> Father: “_Ok. At this stage can we say I’d like to see him around Xmas and we figure it out later._”

> Mother: “_I don’t know what that means but ok_”.[^58]

57     Given that the Father initially agreed to the Mother and N relocating to the US and the Mother was under the impression that this was all settled, when the Father suddenly changed his mind, commenced divorce proceedings on the Mother’s unreasonable behaviour and refused to consent to her relocating with N, the Mother must have been extremely shocked and hurt. In the circumstances, the Mother’s distrust of the Father is not unreasonable. The Mother also explained that the reason she wanted all communication to go through solicitors was because the Father had made representations that were not true previously, and she wanted to ensure that their communications were “properly represented and not misunderstood”[^59].

58     On 9 November 2018, a consent order was recorded for the Father to have supervised access to N three times a week, three hours on Tuesday and Wednesday, and 6.5 hours on Saturday. The Father could only bring N to his home on Saturdays. The parties also agreed that the Father’s access should be supervised by a third party appointed by the Mother as she did not trust the domestic helper at the time, GM, citing incidents where[^60] GM had been “negligent” in (i) leaving a cup of boiling water on the counter edge, causing N to be scalded; (ii) leaving N’s wet clothes in the dryer overnight without switching it on; and (iii) forgetting to switch off the stove hob after cooking. There was also a clause in the 14 November 2018 consent order that GM should not be in the same room as N at all times.

59     In a further consent order dated 12 April 2019[^61], the parties agreed that the Father would terminate GM’s employment and after one month had passed, the Father would have increased access to N for four hours each on Mondays and Wednesdays, and for nine hours on alternating Saturdays and Sundays each week. This access was to be supervised by “an appropriate person to be determined” by the Mother. The Father alleged that the Mother has imposed unreasonable conditions on access and that this is her way of depriving him of contact with N. However, the Father, who was at all times advised by his solicitors, agreed to these terms and conditions which had resulted in the consent orders above.

60     The Father also alleges that the Mother “did all she could to deny” him overnight access to N. The Mother stated that this was due to the Father’s sexual lifestyle, which caused her to fear that the Father would either leave N alone in the night to pursue a sexual encounter, and would “impart his sexual deviancy and debauchery” to N. The Mother’s concerns were not unreasonable, and I had addressed this in my order on 3 October 2019 for the Father to have overnight access to N once a week, with the conditions that (i) the Father was to be with N at all times; and (ii) no third party was to be present during the access.

61     The Father alleged that the Mother was extremely uncooperative and when the Father sent, through solicitors, regular “sharing progress updates”[^62] on the overnight access sessions, the Mother responded with various criticisms for[^63] “rocking” N to sleep and sleeping in the same room as him, spoon-feeding N, allegedly switching the web-camera in N’s room to private mode and pointing out that an electrical device cord had stretched across N’s room between his crib and table, giving rise to a “possible strangulation injury”.

62     The Father also asserted that the Mother would often send hostile text messages[^64] regarding simple everyday tasks which the Father undertook during his access with N[^65], such as washing N’s soiled clothes or bedding from school or giving N melon-flavoured milk which contained excessive sugar. The Mother also emailed N’s school to inform them that she was to be informed whenever N had an “accident” in school and soiled himself as the Father “does not pack” N’s bag and she did “not trust him to be able to handle/explain properly what is clean or not after soiling”[^66].

63     On 30 October 2019, the Mother’s solicitors wrote to the Father’s solicitors in response to his “sharing progress update” and questioned[^67] the Father’s care of N. In the solicitors’ letters, the Father was accused of being “disingenuous” “in an attempt to create an illusion of legitimacy and objectivity”, to “mischaracterise a document containing” the Father’s “subjective observations and submissions” as a “report”. The Father himself also noted that the letters from the Mother’s solicitors often maintained a “high level of animosity and acrimony”[^68].

64     I pause to observe that in divorce proceedings, especially when it comes to contentious child issues, the passion and feelings of the parties frequently run high. However, when solicitors intervene and issue correspondence to the other party in the name of their clients, they should first pause and consider the tone in which their correspondence is crafted. Antagonistic correspondence does nothing to assist the parties, or the Court, and further fuels the fires of blame. It has been said in _BOI v. BOJ_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGCA 61</span> at \[3\]-\[4\] that:

> “_\[C\]ounsel are not the mere “mouthpieces” of their clients. They are not mere automatons, executing every instruction of the client, especially where the client wants each and every point to be taken in order to inflict maximum “damage” on the other party, and where the taking of such points is – in a word – pointless and would not only engender a wastage of the other party’s, but also the court’s, time and resources. There is a reason why lawyers are also known as “counsel” – in such situations, lawyers must counsel their clients and apprise them of what is permissible and what is not.”…_

> _“In order to wield the “correct” set of arms, the lawyer, whilst owing a duty to his or her client, obviously cannot be the mere conduit pipe of that client. He also owes a duty – and indeed a paramount one – to the court. A lawyer has to tread a fine line when adhering to these occasionally inconsistent duties in practice, but that is the very essence of being a legal professional.”_

65     N appeared to have a good relationship with the Father. The Father adduced evidence from third parties[^69], such as the parties’ domestic helper (GM) and babysitters who were engaged by the Mother to supervise the Father’s access with N, showing that he had a close bond with N and that N was happy in his care. The Mother raised the possibility that[^70] GM or the babysitters were paid by the Father to write these affidavits, and I note that some of these affidavits also go into length about observations on the Mother’s parenting or her demeanour, which appear to be wholly unnecessary and somewhat self-serving. As a result, I did not place much weight on the written testimony of the babysitters. Similarly, I did not attach much weight to the statutory declarations of the Mother’s friends regarding her capability as a caregiver.

66     The fact that N enjoys a close relationship with the Father counters the Father’s argument that the Mother has been gatekeeping and trying to alienate N from him. The term “alienation” generally “_applies to a cluster of psychological responses in a child towards a parent with whom he once had a loving relationship_”[^71]; and should be used cautiously. The concept of parental alienation commonly arises in a situation where a child suddenly expresses animosity towards, or rejects, a parent with whom he/she used to be close for no apparent reason. Alienation may not result from any deliberate campaign of denigration by one parent in respect of the other, and the research data supports multi-factorial causes for alienation following parental separation, involving contributions from both parents and vulnerabilities within the child[^72].

67     I found no evidence of parental alienation in the present case. Indeed, the Father admitted that N is “always happy to see”[^73] him. While the Mother often took issue with the Father’s parenting skills and his way/manner of parenting N, and did so in an outspoken and aggressive manner, she did not obstruct his access nor seek to influence N against the Father. The Mother’s actions also resulted from her view that the Father’s actions in doing or not doing certain things, as evidenced from the paragraphs above, placed N in harm’s way.

68     It was also not the Father’s submission that he faced any difficulties in taking access, in fact, from his regular “sharing progress updates” it could be seen that he was not denied access by the Mother. By the Father’s own admission, N always enjoyed their access time and he continued to remain a bright and happy child. The Father himself also admitted that[^74] for a period, from mid-December 2019 to early February 2020, before Dr Woo’s report was released, there appeared to be an active effort from the Mother to pursue and support a co-parenting relationship with the Father.

69     There were also some allegations that the Mother sought to disrupt the Father’s access by taking N on frequent overseas trips. Parties agreed, pursuant to the 12 April 2019 consent order, that the Mother and N could take up to two trips to the US per year, and the Father would contribute towards the trip expenses. During these trips, it is undisputed that the Mother often facilitated access in the form of video calls between the Father and N. The Mother also offered the Father makeup access after their return from a trip in May 2019[^75], even though the Father did not request it, and subsequently the Mother was generally cooperative with regard to makeup access after her trips with N[^76].

70     Further, the Father had only commenced overnight access to N once a week in October 2019, some 6 months ago. Prior to this, he only saw N for day access 2-3 times a week. Based on the above, I was of the view that the relocation would not result in the loss of the father-son relationship as long as (i) generous access orders were put in place with the condition that the Father not have any third party, who was not a family member, present; (ii) the access orders were registered in the Mother’s state of relocation; and (iii) both parties continued to attend counselling and therapy to assist them to move on from these acrimonious proceedings.

71     There was no evidence that the Mother would not facilitate access between N and the Father after relocation. There was no evidence that she had breached any of the orders on access thus far, or obstructed the Father taking access to N. While the Father accused the Mother of being uncooperative and hostile towards him, I find that the Father also showed difficulties in co-parenting with the Mother. For example, the Father had applied for a British passport for N in May 2019 without informing the Mother, and this only came to light after the Father’s Affidavit of Assets and Means was filed. The Father had also failed to inform the Mother when he was terminated from his employment, despite receiving notice of this in May 2019, and did not inform the Mother that as a result, N’s Dependent Pass was also cancelled on 12 June 2019[^77]. The Father subsequently applied for a new Dependent Pass for N.

72     I therefore find that it is in N’s best interest to allow him to relocate to the US with the Mother. While N has a close relationship with the Father, this relationship would not be lost as a result of the relocation if generous access orders were put in place. The Father and Mother are fortunate to be well-off enough to afford several overseas trips per year, and the Father has stated that he can take at most 3-4 trips to the US per year[^78]. The Father is also currently employed with an American bank and can request for a posting to be closer to N if he so wishes. I find that the harm caused to the Mother and N by forcing them to remain in Singapore, far outweighs the dilution of the Father’s relationship with N in the event of relocation.

73     I therefore make the following orders:

> (a)     The Father is to have access to N as follows:

>> (i)       Video access once a day, for up to half an hour each time.

>> (ii)       Twice a year in the US, for up to 10 continuous days each time, including overnight and overseas access.

>> (iii)       Additionally, no more than two further access periods per year, for up to 5 continuous days each time, including overnight access.

>> (iv)       Once a year in the Father’s country of residence, for up to 10 continuous days each time, including overnight access. The Mother is to accompany N to the Father’s country of residence and shall hand over N to the Father for his access. The Mother is to bear the costs of travel for herself and N to the Father’s country of residence.

>> (v)       The Father shall inform the Mother at least three weeks in advance of his intended trip(s) to the US, and the Mother shall reply within a week with N’s school or activity schedule during the proposed access period. The Father shall take into account N’s school and activity schedule during his proposed access period and is responsible for bringing N to and from any school or extracurricular activities during his access period.

>> (vi)       If the Father wishes to exercise overseas access pursuant to (i) above, he is to inform the Mother at least one month in advance with his proposed itinerary and flight, accommodation and contact details, taking into account N’s school schedule. The Mother is to hand over N’s passport to the Father during handover for overseas access, and the Father is to return N’s passport to the Mother when he returns N after access.

>> (vii)       No third party who is not a family member is to be present during the Father’s access and the Father must be with N at all times during his access.

> (b)     The Mother is to ensure that the orders of court regarding N are registered in Celebration, Florida, within 4 weeks of her arrival.

> (c)     The Mother is to send the Father regular updates on N at least once a week by email.

> (d)     The Mother is to attend counselling and/or therapy at least once every 2 weeks, for the period of at least 9 months, for the purposes of resolving her feelings regarding the Father’s infidelities and addressing effective co-parenting.

> (e)     The Father is to attend counselling and/or therapy at least once every 2 weeks, for the period of at least 9 months, for the purposes of resolving any issues regarding sex addiction and appropriate parenting.

74     The parties’ bitterness and anger towards each other is palpable. In divorce proceedings, parties frequently dredge up the details of every single fight and argument which they suffered through during the marriage. For the purposes of the ancillary proceedings, however, most of these details are rarely relevant. As stated by the Court of Appeal in _UYQ v UYP_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 3</span>, “there ought to be **_reasonable_** _accounting rigour that eschews flooding the court with details that would obscure rather than illuminate_.” The Father’s 1,500-page-long list of messages from the Mother[^79] over a one-year period and the Mother’s 300 pages of evidence of the Father’s sexual infidelities[^80] are just a few examples of the parties in this case flooding the court with such unnecessary details. In all, over a period of two years, the parties have also filed a total of no less than 10 applications and 40 affidavits.

## DIVISION OF MATRIMONIAL ASSETS

## Date of valuation of matrimonial assets

77     The values of the Mother’s assets in Table B above were disputed due to the parties taking different dates for the valuation of such assets. It was the Father’s position that the value of her assets should be taken as at the date of Interim Judgment, which was 29 April 2019. The Mother however took the position that her assets should be valued for division as at the date of the ancillary matters hearing, which was 19 May 2020. Oddly enough, both parties did not dispute that the Father’s assets in Table B should be valued as at May/June 2019, which was closer to the date of the Interim Judgment.

78     In _TDT v. TDS and another appeal and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 145</span>, and affirmed in _TQU v. TQT_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 8</span>, it was stated that[^84] the default operative date for the valuation of matrimonial assets is the date of the first ancillary matters hearing, although the court retains the discretion to depart from this date if the facts warranted doing so. The court in _TDT v. TSD_ referred to the case of _Wan Lai Cheng v. Quek Seow Kee_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 4 SLR 405</span> where the matrimonial properties were valued at a date _prior to_ the hearing of the ancillary matters, as it was found that before the hearing, the husband had increased the liabilities of the matrimonial assets, which were not for the family’s benefit. In _TDT v. TDS_, the Interim Judgment was granted sometime in 2013 and the ancillary matters hearing was in 2015. It was found in that case that the husband had dissipated assets and the wife had diverted the business of one of the matrimonial assets; as such, it was fair to value that particular asset at a date prior to the dissipation and diversion, which occurred even prior to the breakdown of the marriage[^85].

79     In the present case, the Father argued that the Mother had not disclosed any statements showing the detailed transactions in her accounts prior to March 2020[^86], suggesting that she could have dissipated/spent much of the monies in her accounts before the hearing of the ancillary matters. The Father also pointed out that there were significant withdrawals from one of the Mother’s main Citibank accounts, amounting to some $265,253.28[^87] between May 2019 and March 2020.

80     In view of the fact that both parties had actually agreed on the valuation of the Father’s assets in the pool to be as at the date of Interim Judgment, as well as the significant decrease in value of $265,253.28 in the Mother’s assets as at the date of ancillary matters hearing, I found that the date of valuation of matrimonial assets to be adopted should be that of the Interim Judgment. If I had adopted the date of ancillary matters hearing as the date of valuation, this would effectively create a peculiar situation where the Father’s assets in the pool were valued as at the date of Interim Judgment, whereas the Mother’s assets are valued as at the date of ancillary matters hearing. I would also add that in any event, there was no evidence to show the value of the Father’s assets as at the date of ancillary matters hearing.

81     The value of another item in Table B which the parties could not agree on was the Mother’s jewellery, watches and bags. The Mother claimed that these were worth S$43,750 but the Father alleged that they were worth much more and submitted a value of S$210,411 which was roughly equivalent to the purchase value[^88]. As the items were designer jewellery, watches and bags and such luxury items do not generally retain their value after several years of use, I was of the view that the purchase value should not be used and had to be adjusted for depreciation as well as resale ability. The Father did not submit any evidence on the depreciated value. In the circumstances, I was of the view that the Mother’s value of $43,750 should be accepted.

## Agreement to retain own assets

82     The Mother claimed that the parties had previously agreed[^89] in or around 2018 that they would each retain their own assets and the Father would not claim a share of her assets. A Deed of Family Arrangement had also been drafted by the Father’s previous solicitors to this effect, however the Deed was eventually not executed. It also appears that even though early in the proceedings, the Father had made representations to the Mother that he would not claim a share of her assets, there was no subsequent agreement reached between the parties on this in contemplation of divorce. After the Interim Judgment was granted and their Affidavits of Assets and Means were filed, both parties had subsequently sought discovery against the other, resulting in 3-4 months of discovery applications and affidavits being exchanged.

83     As stated in _AUA v. ATZ_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 674</span>, when parties had properly and fairly come to a formal agreement in contemplation of divorce, the court will generally attach significant weight to that agreement, when deciding on the division of matrimonial assets, unless there are “_good and substantial grounds for concluding that to do so would effect injustice_[^90]_”_. In the present case, there was no formal agreement executed between the parties that each party would retain their own assets or that there would be no division of matrimonial assets. As such, I did not find that there was any such binding agreement to be taken into account.

#### Inheritance, gifts and pre-marital assets

85     The Father inherited the sum of GBP224,373[^92] from his mother in May 2019 and submits that this inheritance should not be included in the asset pool. The Mother asserted that most of her assets are pre-marital assets and should be excluded from the asset pool. One of the Mother’s investment accounts, the Fidelity Investment Z67-xxx Account (“the Z67 Account”), was also a gift from her father, opened prior to the parties’ marriage and solely operated by him until his death[^93]. The Father’s argument is that notwithstanding that some of the Mother’s assets are premarital assets, as their values were enhanced by the Mother during the marriage[^94] using matrimonial assets, they should form part of the matrimonial pool.

#### The Father’s inheritance money and cashier’s cheque of $80,000

86     The Mother submits that the Father’s inheritance monies should form part of the matrimonial pool as the Father had (i) deposited the inheritance into his pre-existing Citibank UK account which was a matrimonial asset, and had therefore “co-mingled”[^95] his inheritance with the matrimonial assets; and (ii) utilised his inheritance monies for family expenses, in order to maintain the Mother and N.

87     It is not disputed that the Father’s inheritance monies accrued to him only in May 2019, after the Interim Judgment was granted. Both parties did not dispute that the date of determination of the asset pool should be that of the Interim Judgment[^96], which was 29 April 2019. Just because the Father deposited the inheritance monies into a bank account which was a matrimonial asset did not “transform” the nature of the monies. I find that the Father’s inheritance, which accrued to him after the date of the Interim Judgment, is not a matrimonial asset and as such, I deducted the inheritance sum from the balance in the Father’s Citibank UK Account No. xxx8537. Whatever is left in the account forms part of the matrimonial pool.

88     In October 2017, the Father wrote the Mother a cashier’s cheque in the sum of $80,000 to reimburse her for the monies she had previously paid to the Father for rental of the apartment over the years. The Mother confirmed that she did not deposit or encash the said cheque and has no intention of doing the same[^97]. The Father submits that the bank has informed him that the cheque can only be cancelled if the Mother signs a letter of acknowledgment stating that she acknowledges that the cheque will be cancelled and not honoured by the bank. As such, the Father prepared a letter of acknowledgment and asked that the Mother signed it, but she refused to do so.

89     The Mother states that she does not wish to sign the letter of acknowledgment as there is no evidence from the bank that such a letter is required for the cancellation of the cheque. Further, the Mother submits that if the cheque were cancelled, this would adjust the division of matrimonial assets in the Father’s favour and provide him with an “unjustified windfall”[^98].

90     In the circumstances, I order that the Mother sign, within a week, the letter of acknowledgment stating that she acknowledges the cheque will be cancelled and not honoured by the bank. The $80,000 will also be added to the pool as part of the Father’s assets.

#### The Mother’s pre-marital assets and inheritance/gifts from her father

91     It is not disputed that s/nos. 2-4 in Table C above were acquired by the Mother before the marriage, ie. they are _prima facie_ pre-marital assets. However, the Father contends that the Mother had increased the value of these assets during the marriage using her own monies which are matrimonial assets, and therefore, the increase in value should be added to the matrimonial pool.

92     Assets acquired by one party _prior_ to the marriage are only matrimonial assets if they were **_substantially_** _improved during the marriage_ by the other party or by both parties to the marriage, pursuant to section 112(10)(a) of the Women’s Charter. The Court of Appeal in _USB v. USA_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 57</span> has clarified that assets acquired by either spouse before the marriage and which the other spouse does not thereafter improve substantially or which are not used for family purposes, generally stay out of the asset pool, unless they are partially paid for during the marriage by the owning spouse with income that would have been a quintessential matrimonial asset had it been saved up rather than expended on the pre-marriage asset. If so, the proportion of the value of the asset that was acquired during the marriage should go into the pool. The Court also explained that[^99] the improvement of such an asset must “entail the _investment of money or money’s worth_ for the improvement of the asset. The mere increase in the value of the asset does not mean that the asset has “improved”.” In order for the asset to be transformed into a matrimonial asset, there must have been investment of some kind in the asset. In _UJF v. UJG_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 178</span>, it was also highlighted that “the requirement of substantial improvement in respect of prior property is meant to exclude _de minimis_ or negligible contributions”.

93     The Mother’s Fidelity IBM 401(K) Plus Plan was opened in August 2012, 3 months before the parties married while the Mother was employed with IBM. The 401(K) Plus Plan operates somewhat like a CPF account in Singapore, and both employee and employer make contributions towards the plan. The Mother was employed with IBM until August 2013, a total period of one year. As such, the proportion of the monies in the 401(K) Plus Plan acquired during the marriage (the period of 9 months), were matrimonial assets. I therefore took ¾ of the value of the 401(K) Plus Plan and added this to the matrimonial pool.

94     The Mother’s Vanguard Rollover IRA account – Dividend Growth Fund was opened in March 2012, before the marriage. However, the Father contended that as the Mother transferred monies from her Citibank US account, which is a matrimonial asset, into this Vanguard Rollover IRA account during the marriage, this account should form part of the matrimonial pool. The Mother acknowledged that only the further investments made during the marriage, in line with IRS contribution limits, should form part of the matrimonial pool[^100], ie the sum of USD18,595.08 (S$26,219.07). As these investments were acquired during the marriage, they are matrimonial assets and should be part of the pool. However, the balance of the account is a pre-marital asset and in the absence of evidence that either party had substantially improved it during the marriage, should be excluded from the pool.

95     The main asset in contention is the Mother’s Z67 Account, which is worth S$783,460.36. It is not disputed that the Z67 Account was opened in 2005 before the parties’ marriage. The Mother also submitted that it was her late father who had opened and financed the account and was authorised as the trader for that account[^101]. The Father claimed that based on his analysis[^102], the Mother had enhanced the account by making contributions during the marriage. Unfortunately, the Father’s analysis is not supported by documentary evidence but simply from his own Excel spreadsheets. For example, he asserted that the Mother had acquired 600 extra Apple shares (the account originally had 100 Apple shares) during the marriage thereby enhancing the Z67 account. The Mother had however, exhibited evidence to show that[^103] in 2014, Apple had announced a 7:1 stock split, thereby increasing her 100 units of Apple stock to 700 units. The Mother had also exhibited documents from Fidelity Investments[^104] to show that while she is residing in Singapore, she is restricted from moving monies into the accounts.

96     In any event, the incontrovertible evidence is that the Mother had deposited 618 shares in SAP SE ORD NPV ISIN #DExxx4600 into the Z67 Account during the marriage[^105]. These shares were matrimonial assets as they were acquired during the marriage, while the Mother was still employed with SAP. Apart from these shares, I find that the other investments in the Z67 Account are pre-marital assets which were not substantially improved by the Father or both parties during the marriage, and should not be included in the pool.

97     The Mother’s Vanguard Roth IRA Windsor II Fund Inv xxxx-xxx9956 account (s/no. 5 in Table C above) was opened in 2013, shortly after parties married. However, this account was opened with monies from the Mother’s pre-marriage E\*Trade Account No. xxx5350[^106] and there was no co-mingling of funds from this account with the Mother’s other accounts. The Vanguard Rollover IRA Windsor II Fund Inv xxx-xxx3675 account (s/no. 6 in Table C) (“the Vanguard Rollover 3675 account”) was opened in 2015. The Mother claimed that the monies used to purchase the shares in this account came entirely from another pre-marital asset, another Vanguard Windsor II account[^107] which parties had agreed was not a matrimonial asset. The Father did not assert that the Mother had made any contributions to both Vanguard accounts during the marriage, however the Mother provided evidence that for the Vanguard Rollover 3675 account, she had made certain “nominal investments” in 2016 and 2017[^108] in line with IRS annual contribution limits, amounting to USD11,000 in total. In the circumstances, I was of the view that only the **_further_** investments made by the Mother during the marriage should form part of the matrimonial pool.

98     The Mother’s Move SAP RSUs were vested in 2018 and 2019 and the monies were all credited into her Citibank SG$ Account No. xxx5113[^109], which the parties have already agreed is a matrimonial asset to be added to the pool. As such, to add the value of the RSUs separately would be double-counting.

99     I thus took the pool of divisible matrimonial assets to be as follows:

## The law on division of matrimonial assets

100    It is by now trite law that the structured approach in _ANJ v. ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span> (as clarified in _TNL v. TNK and another appeal and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 1 SLR 609</span>) generally applies to the division of matrimonial assets. As the Court of Appeal reiterated at \[37\] of _TNL v. TNK_:

> “the _ANJ_ approach involves three broad steps by which the court should:

>> (a)    express as a ratio the parties’ _direct contributions_ relative to each other, having regard to the amount of _financial_ contribution each party made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets (“Step 1”);

>> (b)    express as a second ratio the parties’ _indirect contributions_ relative to each other, having regard to both _indirect financial_ and _non-financial_ contributions (“Step 2”); and

>> (c)    derive parties’ overall contributions relative to each other by taking an average of the two ratios above, keeping in mind that, depending on the circumstances of each case, the direct and indirect contributions may not be accorded equal weight and one of the two ratios may be accorded more significance than the other (“Step 3”).”

101    The purpose of the _ANJ v. ANK_ structured approach is to “accord due and sufficient recognition to each party’s contribution towards the marriage – without overcompensating or undercompensating a spouse’s indirect contributions – so that the outcome would, in the circumstances of each case, lead to a **just and equitable division**”: \[22\] of _ANJ v. ANK_. The focus of the division of matrimonial property is on achieving a _just and equitable_ division between the parties. The Court of Appeal in _USB v. USA_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 57</span> has also stated that the _ANJ v. ANK_ structured approach should continue to apply to short marriages, and that a key characteristic of the structured approach is that it deals fairly with direct and indirect contributions whilst giving the court a discretion to set the weightage in terms of the relative importance of the direct and indirect contributions[^111]. Such a discretion to determine the weightage of direct and indirect contributions is especially useful in a short marriage.

### Direct contributions

102    The parties generally agreed that neither party had contributed directly towards the acquisition of the other party’s assets. There were no jointly owned assets to divide. Based on the asset pool, the direct contributions is in the ratio 94.6:5.4 in favour of the Mother.

### Indirect contributions

103    In the present case, while the parties each described their indirect contributions in great detail, it is not disputed that the marriage lasted in effect about 6 years, from the date of marriage to the time the Father moved out of the home. Although it was not disputed that the Father paid for the majority of the household expenses during the marriage[^112], it was also not disputed that[^113] (i) the Mother had reimbursed the Father for some of these expenses during the marriage by transferring the total sum of at least $231,440 to him, over the period of August 2013 to April 2019; and (ii) the Mother paid for some of the parties’ trips and holidays during the marriage, the four IVF procedures, special outings to concerts or the Australian Open and most of N’s clothes and toys. The Father also stated that in the same period, he also transferred a total of $58,442 to the Mother as “adhoc repayment”[^114], including repayment for his watches.

104    The Father submits that if not for his continued contribution towards the bulk of the family’s expenses[^115], the Mother would not have been able to accumulate her assets. While this may be the case, the Mother’s sacrifices should also not be trivialised in any way: in the form of moving from the US to Singapore for the sake of the Father, giving up her emotional support, friends and family in her home country, and undergoing four IVF procedures in order to realise the parties’ joint dream of having children. Taking all the relevant factors into account, I find that an appropriate ratio for the parties’ indirect contributions would be 65:35 in favour of the Mother.

### Ratio adjustment

105    In _ANJ v ANK_, it was noted that the length of the marriage, size of the assets, and the extent and nature of indirect contributions would impact on the relative weightage of the direct and indirect contributions. For long marriages especially, greater weightage may be given to indirect contributions, whereas for short marriages, it would be appropriate to adjust the ratio to give greater weight to the direct contributions.

106    In _UJF v. UJG_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 178</span>, it was also stated that in a short marriage, greater weight should be given to the direct contributions as opposed to the indirect contributions[^116]. This was because indirect contributions would “generally accumulate and be substantial only with a longer passage of time”, compared to direct contributions. That case concerned a short marriage of 4.5 years with no children, and a weightage of 75:25 in favour of direct contributions was reached.

107    In the present case, which is a short marriage of about 7 years with one child, I find that a weightage of 70:30 in favour of direct contributions is appropriate.

> The weighted average of the Mother’s contributions is thus:

>> ((94.6/100) x 70) + (65/100) x 30) = 66.22 + 19.5 = 85.72 = rounded down to **85.7**

> The weighted average of the Father’s contributions is thus:

>> ((5.4/100) x 70) + (35/100) x 30) = 3.78 + 10.5 = 14.28 = rounded up to **14.3**

108    Applying the division ratio of 85.7% to the Mother and 14.3% to the Father, this would result in the Father being entitled to the sum of $125,903 and the Mother being entitled to the sum of $754,536 from the pool. Currently, the Mother’s assets already form about 86% of the pool and the Father’s 14% of the pool. In the circumstances, I order that each party retain their own assets held in their names.

### Adverse inferences to be drawn

109    Both parties submitted that an adverse inference should be drawn against the other for failure to give proper disclosure of their assets. For the court to draw an adverse inference against either party, there must be (a) a substratum of evidence that establishes a _prima facie_ case against the person against whom the inference is to be drawn; and (b) that person must have had some particular access to the information he is said to be hiding[^117].

110    The Mother claimed that[^118] the Father had not contributed much to the asset pool even though he earned more than the Mother during the marriage, and as such must have some hidden assets. As the Mother herself pointed out, the Father’s monthly expenses were high. The Father also paid for most of the family’s expenses and the family was used to leading a comfortable lifestyle.

111    The Father also wanted an adverse inference to be drawn against the Mother in respect of “assets which she had hidden”[^119], namely a Broadridge Financial account containing some Morgan Stanley shares and a Fintech Group account. The Mother had explained in an affidavit filed in July 2019[^120] that the Morgan Stanley shares were held in her Computershare US account and the change in holding company was due to an involuntary corporate action. There was no document evidencing a Fintech Group account held by the Mother.

112    In the circumstances, as there was no evidence suggesting that either party had hidden or failed to disclose their assets, I did not draw an adverse inference against either party.

### Reimbursement of certain sums by the Father and transfer taxes, fees and charges for the Mother’s assets

113    The Mother also submitted that[^121] (i) the Father should be ordered to reimburse the Mother for certain sums which he had previously agreed to pay, from his share of the matrimonial assets; and (ii) should the Mother have to transfer some of her assets in the US to the Father as his share of the matrimonial assets, the Father should be solely responsible for the payment of any taxes, penalties, expenses, fees and charges in respect of such transfer.

114    The Mother states that the Father had[^122], in a letter from his previous solicitors dated 29 May 2019, agreed to reimburse her for N’s medical expenses; and that the Father has two insurance policies, one provided by his employer and one private insurance policy, which covers N’s medical expenses. The Mother asserts that as a result of the Father’s “agreement” to reimburse her for N’s medical expenses, it should follow that the Father should also reimburse her for procuring medical insurance for N. The Mother is also claiming reimbursement of the medical expenses incurred by N and herself at KK Hospital, following their return from the US in March 2020, pursuant to the COVID19 measures put in place for all persons returning from abroad. She claims that as the Father is “responsible for forcing” N and the Mother to return to Singapore from the US, he should therefore bear their associated medical expenses.

115    The Mother is therefore claiming from the Father the following sums:

> (i)     N’s medical expenses from the visit to the allergist and associated medicines amounting to S$933.80;

> (ii)     The Mother’s and N’s medical expenses from their stay at KK Hospital following their return from the US in March 2020, amounting to S$642.20 and S$829.58 respectively; and

> (iii)     N’s medical insurance cost from 18 June to 6 July 2019, amounting to USD35.55.

116    The terms of the consent order dated 12 April 2019 represented the parties’ agreement to the expenses and interim maintenance that the Father would pay for N and the Mother. At all times, both parties were represented and advised by solicitors before the consent order was recorded on 12 April 2019. As such, there was no basis for the Mother to claim that the Father should be paying for certain expenses or sums which were **not** represented in the said consent order. If these expenses were agreed on, pursuant to parties’ intention, they would surely have been provided in the consent order. None of the expenses stated by the Mother above were mentioned in the consent order. I was also of the view that this exhibited extremely petty behaviour on the part of the Mother, given that the Father had already paid for, and was continuing to pay for, most of N’s expenses, including the rental of the apartment which the Mother and N resided in. In the circumstances, I make no order on the reimbursements requested by the Mother.

117    I found it mischievous for the Mother to assert that in the event that she had to transfer any of her assets in the US to the Father, that he should bear the taxes or fees associated with such assets. It is up to the Mother to decide if she wishes to liquidate funds in Singapore or in the US in order to make the transfer to the Father, and the Father should not be made to bear the associated fees should she elect to liquidate her US assets. Based on the division ratio above, in any event, each party is to retain their own assets so the issue of such taxes and fees does not arise.

## MAINTENANCE

118    The Father has already paid a significant amount of maintenance towards the Mother and N’s expenses, pursuant to the consent order dated 12 April 2019. He has, since April 2019, been paying for the following:

> (i)     The rental of the apartment in which the Mother and N reside, at $6,800 per month;

> (ii)     The utilities, TV and Internet, for the above apartment;

> (iii)     N’s school fees of $3,210 per month, paid directly to the school;

> (iv)     A monthly sum of $3,400 to the Mother directly;

> (v)     The Mother’s medical insurance premiums at USD688.50 per quarter; and

> (vi)     $2,000 per trip for two trips per year for the Mother’s travel expenses.

119    The relevant factors which the court takes into account in ascertaining maintenance for a child and ex-wife are set out in sections 69(4) as well as 114(1) of the Women’s Charter. These factors include their financial needs, the parties’ income, earning capacity and assets, present and anticipated financial position, contributions to the marriage, and standard of living during the marriage, including for a child, the manner in which he was being, and in which the parties to the marriage, expected him to be, educated or trained.

## Maintenance for the Mother

120    Although it has been stated that the overarching principle embodied in section 114(2) of the Women’s Charter is “financial preservation, which requires the wife to be maintained at a standard, which is, to a reasonable extent, commensurate with the standard of living she had enjoyed during the marriage”[^123], it is also clear that this has to be applied in a manner that takes into account the “new realities” that flow from the breakdown of a marriage. The ex-wife is not entitled to expect a “full subsidy for her lifestyle” and must “exert reasonable efforts to secure gainful employment and to sustain her pre-breakdown lifestyle”: _ARY v ARX and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGCA 13</span>.

121    In the present case, the Mother sought maintenance for herself in the sum of USD4,296.85 per month in the event that relocation is granted. This was based on her estimated total monthly expenses in the US. The Mother claims that due to the COVID19 situation, the global economic outlook is not positive and this would impact her ability to find a job in the US. Notwithstanding this, the Mother accepts that her chances of obtaining employment in the US would be higher than in Singapore as she is a US citizen and would have the benefit of a support system that would assist her to re-enter the labour market there. Given that the Mother is only 45 years old and is highly qualified (she has a Bachelor of Science degree and a Masters degree in Business Administration), I have no doubt that she has a good earning capacity and should eventually be able to find employment in the US.

122    Maintenance for an ex-wife is also not a given, and even nominal maintenance should not be ordered “_automatically or as a matter of course_”[^124]. As the Mother has a high earning capacity and is in possession of significant means of her own: the value of her assets greatly outweigh the Father’s, I order that there be no maintenance for the Mother.

## Maintenance for N

123    The Mother wanted the Father to pay for the entirety of N’s monthly expenses in the US. The Father submits that[^125] each party should bear N’s expenses when N is with them and that N’s school fees, medical/dental expenses as well as enrichment activities should be split equally.

124    The Father is currently earning about $25,833 per month[^126] as a global information security officer in an American bank. Before the Mother was made redundant in April 2019, she was earning S$16,248.60[^127] per month as a Business Development Expert. I have already stated above that the Mother’s earning capacity is not in question and it will simply be a matter of time before she finds employment again.

125    The Father’s assessment of N’s reasonable expenses which are incurred by both parents is about S$15,015, which he suggests each party bears equally, ie. S$7,507.50 each. This is higher than the figure estimated by the Mother for N’s monthly expenses: USD4,700.81[^128] (about S$6,816[^129]). In the circumstances, I find the Mother’s estimate of N’s monthly expenses at USD4,700.81 to be reasonable.

126    It is the duty of both parents to contribute towards the maintenance of the child. Section 68 of the Women’s Charter, which applies to divorce proceedings by virtue of section 127(2), makes it clear that it is the duty of a parent to “maintain or contribute to the maintenance of his or her children, whether they are in his or custody or in the custody of any other person”. The ratio of the parties’ income is about 61:39 with the Father earning more. I therefore find it fair and reasonable for the Father to bear 60% of N’s monthly expenses, which come up to about S$4,100 and I order that the Father is to pay the Mother a monthly maintenance for N in the sum of S$4,100 per month, commencing 30 June 2020.

## OTHER OUTSTANDING ISSUES

127    The Father has also asked that orders/directions be given regarding the collection of his belongings from the rented matrimonial home where the Mother and N reside.

128    The Father submits that the parties had initially agreed, in a Settlement Agreement dated 9 April 2019, that the Father would attend at the Mother’s residence by prior appointment and in the presence of the Mother’s solicitors to go through a list of the personal items he wishes to remove from the residence. However, after extensive correspondence between the parties disputing the mode of the Father “marking” the items, which items belonged to the Father and whether the Father’s solicitors were also to be present, they were unable to resolve the issue and the Father is still unable to collect his belongings. The Mother’s position was that the Father has “forfeited” his claim to his belongings as he did not respond to a letter from the Mother’s solicitors giving him until 6 February 2020 to respond, otherwise the Mother would “proceed as she deems fit”[^130].

129    I note that the Father has, by way of solicitors’ letter dated 28 June 2019[^131], provided the Mother with a list of the items he wishes to collect. The current dispute between the parties appears to be over whether the Father can (i) mark his belongings with a sticker to indicate the belongings he will collect; (ii) take photographs of the belongings marked; and (iii) be accompanied by his solicitors at the time of collection.

130    In order that the parties may close this chapter and move on, I order as follows:

> (i)     That the Father is to inform the Mother, within a week from the date of this order, of no more than 3 dates and times at which to collect his belongings from her residence, and the Mother is to agree to one of the 3 dates given;

> (ii)     That the parties may be accompanied by their solicitors during the collection; and

> (iii)     That the Father may mark the belongings he wishes to take with stickers and may take photographs of the same for record purposes.

## CONCLUSION

131    I therefore make the following orders:

> (a)     The Mother and Father are to have joint custody of N, with care and control to the Mother;

> (b)     Leave is granted for N and the Mother to relocate to Florida, the United States of America;

> (c)     Upon relocation, the Father is to have access to N as follows:

>> (i)       Video access once a day, for up to half an hour each time.

>> (ii)       Twice a year in the US, for up to 10 continuous days each time, including overnight and overseas access.

>> (iii)       Additionally, no more than two further access periods per year, for up to 5 continuous days each time, including overnight access.

>> (iv)       Once a year in the Father’s country of residence, for up to 10 continuous days each time, including overnight access. The Mother is to accompany N to the Father’s country of residence and shall hand over N to the Father for his access. The Mother is to bear the costs of travel for herself and N to the Father’s country of residence.

>> (v)       The Father shall inform the Mother at least three weeks in advance of his intended trip(s) to the US, and the Mother shall reply within a week with N’s school or activity schedule during the proposed access period. The Father shall take into account N’s school and activity schedule during his proposed access period and is responsible for bringing N to and from any school or extracurricular activities during his access period.

>> (vi)       If the Father wishes to exercise overseas access pursuant to (i) above, he is to inform the Mother at least one month in advance with his proposed itinerary and flight, accommodation and contact details, taking into account N’s school schedule. The Mother is to hand over N’s passport to the Father during handover for overseas access, and the Father is to return N’s passport to the Mother when he returns N after access.

>> (vii)       No third party who is not a family member is to be present during the Father’s access and the Father must be with N at all times during his access.

> (d)     The Mother is to ensure that the orders of court regarding N are registered in Celebration, Florida, within 4 weeks of her arrival.

> (e)     The Mother is to send the Father regular updates on N at least once a week by email.

> (f)     The Mother is to attend counselling and/or therapy at least once every 2 weeks, for the period of at least 9 months, for the purposes of resolving her feelings regarding the Father’s infidelities and addressing effective co-parenting.

> (g)     The Father is to attend counselling and/or therapy at least once every 2 weeks, for the period of at least 9 months, for the purposes of resolving any issues regarding sex addiction and appropriate parenting.

> (h)     Each party is to retain their own assets held in their respective names.

> (i)     The Mother is to sign, within a week from the date of this order, a letter of acknowledgment stating that she acknowledges that the cashier’s cheque of $80,000 from the Father will be cancelled and not honoured by the bank.

> (j)     There shall be no maintenance for the Mother with no liberty to apply.

> (k)     The Father shall pay maintenance for N in the sum of S$4,100 per month, or the equivalent sum in USD, commencing 30 June 2020. The said maintenance shall be deposited into the Mother’s bank account on the last day of each month.

> (l)     The Father is to inform the Mother, within a week from the date of this order, of no more than 3 dates and times at which to collect his belongings from her residence, and the Mother is to agree to one of the 3 dates given;

>> a.       Both parties may be accompanied by their solicitors during the collection; and

>> b.       The Father may mark the belongings he wishes to take with stickers and may take photographs of the same for record purposes.

## Costs

132    The Mother sought an order for the Father to pay the costs of the proceedings to her. The Mother’s case was that the Father had (i) reneged on his agreements with the Mother, leading to substantial litigation; and (ii) caused the Mother to incur unnecessary costs throughout the proceedings by filing an “unmeritorious” application to strike out her relocation application, “dragging” the Mother through an extensive discovery process that resulted in her obtaining documents for assets which were mostly conceded to be outside the matrimonial pool, and filing ancillary affidavits containing blank pages/evidence which was disallowed. The Father, on the other hand, claimed that there was no clear agreement for the relocation of N and the Mother and that he had to defend the relocation in order to safeguard his relationship with N. It was also the Father’s position that he had not known the extent of the Mother’s assets and wealth until affidavits were filed and discovery was undertaken in the proceedings.

133    The award of costs lies in the discretion of the court. It was also stated in _JBB v. JBA_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHCF 6</span> that the court is free to depart from the guiding principle that costs follow the event (such event being the grant of the interim judgment) when the court considers that the circumstances of the case warrant some other costs order or where it is appropriate to do so. Some of the considerations the court may take into account when awarding costs are also stipulated in rules 854-857 of the Family Justice Rules, namely, the conduct of the parties, including before and during the proceedings; the parties’ conduct in relation to any attempt at resolving the cause or matter by mediation or any other means of dispute resolution; and the party’s failure to establish any claim or issue which he has raised, and has thereby unnecessarily or unreasonably protracted, or added to the costs or complexity of, the proceedings.

134    In the present case, the divorce was originally contested, and the parties eventually agreed to an uncontested divorce based on the Father’s unreasonable behaviour. Parties also attended mediation several times in order to attempt resolution of the ancillary matters. While I am of the view that the matter was protracted partly as a result of the Father’s change in position regarding the relocation and the division of assets, I do not think that the Father can be faulted for contesting the relocation application given that this would impact his time spent with N.

135    In _JBB v. JBA_, one of the reasons given for a possible departure from the general principle that costs should follow the event was the “attempt to reduce and not further increase hostility between the parties who must continue to cooperate in jointly parenting their children long after the divorce is concluded”[^132]. I echo that sentiment. In the present case, both parties have exhausted their resources, both financial and emotional, in attempting to get the better of each other in the proceedings. Angry words have been exchanged _ad nauseum_ in numerous affidavits and submissions. This should all now come to an end. In the circumstances, I order that each party is to bear their own costs.

136    Now that the proceedings have drawn to a close, I hope that the parties are similarly able to close this unhappy chapter in their lives and move on, with a view to working together to ensure that N grows up to become the best person he can possibly be. Viktor E. Frankl, the author of “Man’s Search for Meaning”, once said that “_when we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves_”, and that “_everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms – to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way._” I sincerely hope that these two parties will choose to be bigger and better people, for the sake of their child’s wellbeing, and will no longer have to look to the court to manage their disputes for them.
