Family Law – Interim injunction – Restraining termination of tenancy agreement – Section 5 of the Guardianship of Infants Act

17 September 2020

### District Judge Lo Wai Ping:

## Introduction

1       This case concerned a wife’s _ex-parte_ application for interim injunctions relating to a one-year tenancy of a flat unit that her husband had entered into in March 2020 (prior to their marriage). The injunctions applied for seek to restrain the husband from terminating the tenancy early and to mandate that he continues to rent the specific flat unit (until the end of the tenancy) for her to occupy exclusively together with their infant son (“**Child**”). I did not grant the wife’s application. She has appealed against my decision and I set out below the reasons for my decision.

## Background

2       The Plaintiff is the mother, and the Defendant the father, of the Child. The parties met in Thailand (Bangkok) in 2019. The Plaintiff was working there at the time. She is an Israeli citizen and an architect by profession. The Defendant is a Singaporean and an engineer.

3       In November 2019, the Plaintiff gave birth to the Child in Thailand. At the time of the birth of the Child, the parties were not married.

4       In March 2020, the Plaintiff and the Child moved from Thailand to Singapore. Subsequently, the parties were married in Singapore on 2 April 2020. The Defendant had been persuading the Plaintiff to marry him and relocate to Singapore with the Child. Earlier in January 2020, the Plaintiff had taken a day trip from Bangkok to Singapore to visit the Defendant. As per the Plaintiff’s request, the Defendant had agreed in writing during the visit in January 2020 that the Plaintiff would have custody of the Child.

5       In March 2020, the Defendant entered into a tenancy agreement dated 7 March 2020 (“**Tenancy Agreement**”) for a one-year tenancy of a flat unit at a condominium xxx in Singapore (“**the Flat**”) commencing from 7 March 2020. The Plaintiff and the Child (4 months old then) stayed in the Flat with the Defendant after their arrival in Singapore in March 2020.

6       After their marriage on 2 April 2020, the Defendant applied for a Long-Term Visit Pass (“**LTVP**”) for the Plaintiff. He also applied to register the Child as a Singapore citizen. Unfortunately, the parties’ relationship fell apart subsequently and the Defendant moved out of the Flat in July 2020. According to the Plaintiff, she had received an in-principle approval for her LTVP application in early June 2020 (subject only to payment), but the Defendant had cancelled her application thereafter.

#### Maintenance Proceedings in MSS No. 1581

7       The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant had deserted her and the Child (as he no longer lived at the Flat) and that he had also asked them to move out of the Flat and leave Singapore. The Plaintiff claimed that she had no money to survive, to pay rent, food and other necessities and she also had no friends in Singapore she could stay with. Whilst she had worked and lived in Bangkok for the past 7 years, she had given up her job in Bangkok to relocate to Singapore with the Child at the Defendant’s behest. She could not return to Bangkok as her work permit had been cancelled. She also had not been back to Israel for the past 7 years. As such, she had no choice but to commence maintenance proceedings against the Defendant for the Child and herself in Singapore and a maintenance summons MSS No. 1581 (“**MSS 1581**”) was issued in June 2020 against the Defendant under sections 69(1) and (2) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353).

8       With her maintenance proceedings in MSS 1581 pending before the Family Court, the Plaintiff’s social visit pass to remain in Singapore was extended. According to the Plaintiff, the relevant authority (ICA) had agreed to extend her social visit pass until the conclusion of these maintenance proceedings.

#### Originating Summons No. 102 of 2020

9       Subsequently, on 15 July 2020, the Plaintiff started another action in the Family Court against the Defendant in Originating Summons No. 102 of 2020 (**“Originating Summons**”). This action was brought under section 5 of the Guardianship of Infants Act (Cap 122) (“**GIA**”) seeking orders that she be granted sole custody, care and control of the Child (with the Defendant having restricted and supervised access to the Child).

10     In addition, the Plaintiff also prayed in the Originating Summons for the following orders to be granted against the Defendant:

> (a)     the Defendant be ordered to reinstate, restore or re­apply for the Plaintiff’s LTVP from the Immigration and Checkpoint Authority (“**ICA**”) and to do all that is necessary to enable the Plaintiff to obtain the LTVP;

> (b)     the Defendant be restrained, whether by himself or his servants and/or agents, from terminating the tenancy of the Flat before the expiration of the Tenancy Agreement;

> (c)     the Defendant be ordered to continue payment of the rent in the monthly sum of S$2,250 for the Flat for the duration of the tenancy of the same and in the event he has ceased to do so, to reinstate or restore the tenancy of the Flat by payment of the rent of S$2,250 a month and all arrears of rent for the duration of the tenancy and/or lease;

> (d)     the Defendant, whether by himself or his servants and/or agents, be restrained from evicting or removing the Plaintiff and/or the Child from occupation of the Flat for the duration of the tenancy and/or lease;

> (e)     the Defendant be ordered to permit the plaintiff and the Child to occupy the Flat for the duration of the tenancy and/or lease; and

> (f)     the Defendant, whether by himself or his servants and/or agents, be restrained from subletting any part of the Flat while the Plaintiff and the Child are residing therein.

#### Ex-Parte Summons No. 1910 of 2020

11     On the same day 15 July 2020, by way of an ex-parte Summons No. 1910 of 2020 (“**SUM 1910**”) filed under the Originating Summons, the Plaintiff also applied for interim injunctions against the Defendant on the terms of the prayers set out in paragraphs 10 (a) to (f) above. In addition, the Plaintiff also prayed in SUM 1910 to be granted interim sole custody, care and control of the Child pending the hearing of the Originating Summons.

12     As an urgent ex-parte hearing was sought for SUM 1910, it was fixed for hearing on 17 July 2020. The Defendant (who was notified in the late afternoon of 16 July 2020 of this) was present at the hearing on 17 July 2020. He confirmed that he had just been served that morning with the Originating Summons, SUM 1910 and the Plaintiff’s supporting affidavit of 15 July 2020 for the Originating Summons.

## Dismissal of prayers pertaining to the Flat

13     I heard the Plaintiff’s SUM 1910 on an ex-parte basis, but with the presence of the Defendant. Notwithstanding the prayers set out in SUM 1910, the Plaintiff’s counsel confirmed at the hearing that the Plaintiff was only asking for interim injunctions on the prayers pertaining to the Flat (that is, paragraphs 10(b) to (f) above) up to the hearing of the Originating Summons. The Plaintiff was not asking for any other interim orders. Reference was made to the Plaintiff’s supporting affidavit for the Originating Summons.

14     After hearing the Plaintiff’s counsel, I dismissed the Plaintiff’s application for the said interim injunctions. However, I made directions for an early case conference to be held to expedite the hearing of the Originating Summons.

## Reasons for Decision

15     As stated by the High Court in the recent case of _Challenger Technologies Ltd v Courts (Singapore) Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 218</span> (“**_Challenger Technologies_**”) at \[13\], the principles governing whether an interim injunction should be granted were laid down by the House of Lords in the case of _American Cyanamid Company v Ethicon Limited_ <span class="citation">\[1975\] AC 396</span> (“**_American Cyanamid_**”) and the requirements, in brief, are two-fold:

> (a)     that there is a serious question to be tried; and

> (b)     that the balance of convenience lies in favour of granting an injunction.

16     I will first deal with the first issue of whether there was a serious question to be tried under the Originating Summons. As was succinctly set out by the High Court in _Challenger Technologies_ at \[15\] to \[17\]:

> \[15\]  The test laid down in _American Cyanamid_ was whether the claimant had a “real prospect of succeeding in his claim for a permanent injunction at the trial” (at 408). In other words, the claimant has to show that there is a serious issue to be tried. Lord Diplock relevantly said at 407:

>> The use of such expressions as ‘a probability,’ ‘a prima facie case,’ or ‘a strong prima facie case’ in the context of the exercise of a discretionary power to grant an interlocutory injunction leads to confusion as to the object sought to be achieved by this form of temporary relief. _The court no doubt must be satisfied that the claim is not frivolous or vexatious, in other words, that there is a serious issue to be tried._ \[emphasis added\]

> \[16\]  This limb was expounded upon by A P Rajah J in _Hong Kong Vegetable Oil Co Ltd v Wicker_ <span class="citation">\[1977–1978\] SLR(R) 65</span> at \[15\]:

>> Principle 1 ‘provided that the court is satisfied that there is a serious question to be tried, there is no rule that the party seeking an interlocutory injunction must show a prima facie case’. I interpreted this principle to mean that once the court is satisfied that there is a serious question to be tried then the court is not to follow the previous practice of requiring a plaintiff to show a prima facie case before granting him an interim injunction. Therefore, in the instant case I was of the view that I had first to decide whether there is in fact and in law a serious question to be tried and again in my view implicit in ‘a serious question to be tried’ is the question whether the action is properly conceived and whether all the proper, necessary and/or interested parties are before the court so that any order made by the court can properly and effectively be implemented. In my judgment, if these elements or any of them are not present then, because of non-compliance with this principle alone, the motion should stand dismissed.

> \[17\]  The prospects of the plaintiff’s success are to be investigated only to a limited extent: Singapore Civil Procedure 2015 Vol I (G P Selvam gen ed) (Sweet and Maxwell, 2015) (“_Singapore Civil Procedure 2015_”) at para 29/1/12. As is clear from the preceding passages, this is a low threshold and all that has to be seen is whether the plaintiff has prospects of success, which, in substance and reality, exist.

17     The Plaintiff argued that under the Tenancy Agreement, she and the Child were permitted occupiers of the Flat and the Flat was rented by the Defendant for the purposes of providing a home for them. Therefore, she and Child had a right to live in the Flat for the term of the Tenancy Agreement.

18     It was further submitted that the Defendant’s cancellation (or withdrawal) of her LTVP application and his cancellation of the application to register the Child as a Singapore citizen (which was informed by the Defendant at the hearing) were acts taken by the Defendant to deprive her and the Child from residing in Singapore.

19     Having the Child move out of the Flat was also against the best interests of the Child as the Child was entitled to have a secured roof over his head as this was the original intent of the parties in March 2020 when the Tenancy Agreement was entered into. The consequence of the termination of the Tenancy Agreement meant that the Child was to move out of the only home that he knew and was familiar with in Singapore.

20     Based on the above, the Plaintiff submitted that there were serious questions to be tried, that is, whether it was in the best interests of the Child for the Child to be bandied from place to place in the conflict between the parties.

21     On this issue, I note that the Originating Summons was taken up under section 5 of the GIA. This section provides as follows:

> **Power of court to make, discharge or amend orders for custody and maintenance of infants**

> 5.    The court may, upon the application of either parent or of any guardian appointed under this Act, make orders as it may think fit regarding the custody of such infant, the right of access thereto and the payment of any sum towards the maintenance of the infant and may alter, vary or discharge such order on the application of either parent or of any guardian appointed under this Act.

22     Under section 5 of the GIA, the Family Court may make orders as it may think fit regarding:

> (a)     the custody of an infant;

> (b)     the right of access to an infant; and

> (c)     the payment of any sum towards the maintenance of an infant.

The Family Court also has powers to alter, vary or discharge an order made under section 5 of the GIA.

23     First, I note that other than the orders relating to child custody and access as prayed for in the Originating Summons, the other orders prayed for in the Originating Summons relate to:

> (a)     the application of an LTVP for the Plaintiff; and

> (b)     requiring the Plaintiff to take (or restraining the Plaintiff from taking) certain actions with respect to the Tenancy Agreement and the Flat so as to ensure that the Plaintiff and the Child may continue to stay in the Flat (and also have exclusive occupation of it) until the expiration of the term of the Tenancy Agreement (the “**Relevant Actions**”).

24     As was mentioned above at paragraph 13, notwithstanding the prayers set out in SUM 1910, the Plaintiff was only seeking for interim injunctions relating to the Relevant Actions.

25     In her submissions, the Plaintiff referred to the best interests of the Child to persuade this court to grant her the interims injunctions relating to the Relevant Actions.

26     The Relevant Actions do not relate to the custody of the Child, or to the right of access to the Child. In fact, in a type-written statement dated 17 January 2020 and signed by the Defendant (titled “Custody Agreement” and exhibited in the Plaintiff’s supporting affidavit), the Defendant had confirmed that the Plaintiff shall have custody of the Child and the Defendant would not challenge her right on this point.

27     In addition to orders relating to the custody of a child and the access rights to a child, the Family Court may make _an order regarding the payment of any sum towards the maintenance of an infant_ under section 5 of the GIA. I note that the Plaintiff had commenced in June 2020 maintenance proceedings in MSS 1581 for the Child and herself even before she filed the Originating Summons and SUM 1910 against the Defendant.

28     I wish to point out that the sum effect of the Relevant Actions under the Originating Summons would be to maintain status quo with respect to the residence of the Plaintiff and the Child in the Flat until the expiration of the term of the Tenancy Agreement. This would effectively confer on the Plaintiff and the Child a right to stay in the Flat even though they were not parties to the Tenancy Agreement. I note that while section 5 of the GIA empowers the court to make an order for the payment of such sum for the maintenance of a child, it does not confer on the court the power to order that a child be entitled to stay in a specified flat or premises for a specified duration. Likewise, any maintenance order that may be obtained by the Plaintiff for the Child and herself would be in respect of payment of a maintenance sum. It would be for the Plaintiff to decide on the accommodation for the Child and herself, using the maintenance sum payable by the Defendant.

29     For the above reasons and based on section 5 of the GIA, I did not accept the Plaintiff’s submission that there was a serious question to be tried.

30     The Plaintiff also sought to persuade this court that it has the power under Rule 958 of the Family Justice Rules to grant injunctions with respect to the Relevant Actions. Reference was made to the case of _TYC v TYD_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGFC 23</span> (“**_TYC_**”).

31     Rule 958 of the Family Justice Rules states as follows:

> **Inherent powers of Court**

> 958.  To avoid doubt it is hereby declared that nothing in these Rules shall be deemed to limit or affect the inherent powers of the Court to make any order as may be necessary to prevent injustice or to prevent an abuse of the process of the Court.

32     In _TYC_, the District Judge granted an interim injunction requiring the plaintiff in that case to take the necessary steps to apply for a fresh dependant’s pass for the defendant as the defendant’s pass was cancelled by the plaintiff. The cancellation occurred after the defendant had taken up a maintenance application against the plaintiff and a mediation to resolve the maintenance action had failed. The next day after the cancellation of the defendant’s dependant pass, the plaintiff commenced divorce proceedings against the defendant. In _TYC_, the plaintiff had asked the defendant and her child to leave their (rented) residence and they did so, and they were staying elsewhere when the interim injunction application was heard. The court granted the interim injunction in exercise of the inherent procedural (and not substantive) powers of the court to allow for a fair trial in that case to proceed.

33     Unlike the case of _TYC_ (where the interim injunction was granted in exercise of the inherent procedural powers of the court to allow for a fair trial to proceed in that case), the interim injunctions relating to the Relevant Actions in the present case would confer a substantive right not only for the Child but also for the Plaintiff to stay in the Flat pending the hearing of the Originating Summons. And this is notwithstanding the fact that the Plaintiff had commenced maintenance proceedings against the Defendant for the Child and herself. Therefore, I was not persuaded that the inherent powers of the court under Rule 958 would be applicable and should be exercised in granting the interim injunctions relating to the Relevant Actions.

34     On the issue of where the balance of convenience lies, the Plaintiff and the Child could always find alternative accommodation even if the Flat was no longer available to them and they can avail their rights against the Defendant for the payment of maintenance sums (which would include expenses that have to be incurred for their reasonable accommodation) under section 69 of the Women’s Charter and / or section 5 of the GIA. Hence, given the rights of the Plaintiff and the Child to maintenance and the availability of alternative accommodation in Singapore for them, there is no balance of convenience in favour of granting the interim injunctions sought.

35     For all the above reasons, I dismissed the Plaintiff’s application.
