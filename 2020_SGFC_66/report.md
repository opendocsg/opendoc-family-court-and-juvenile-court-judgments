Sole custody; relocation, maintenance and division of assets

7 August 2020

### District Judge Jen Koh:

1       The facts of this case are convoluted and warrant a detailed rendering for a fair understanding of the contested ancillary matters before the court.

## Introduction / Background

2       The parties dissolved their marriage though an Interim Judgment granted on 31 August 2018 on the ground that the marriage had broken down irretrievably. The husband commenced the writ in May 2018 in reliance on the fact of parties’ 4 years separation as the parties had not cohabited as husband and wife from May 2013. The writ was eventually resolved on an uncontested basis leading to the grant of the Interim Judgment.

3       The ancillary matters were contested and the issues that had to be determined included:

> (a)     Custody care and control of the parties’ 5 children;

> (b)     The wife’s application for the children to be relocated to the United States of America (USA) where the wife has been residing since July 2017;

> (c)     Financial provision for the children;

> (d)     The wife’s claim for spousal maintenance;

> (e)     Identification of the matrimonial assets;

> (f)     Division of the matrimonial assets, and

> (g)     The costs of the proceedings.

4       I made final orders on the ancillary matters on 15 May 2020 after a saga of litigation that spanned 9 years from 2011 and which traversed 3 different jurisdictions. The wife filed an appeal against the entirety of the ancillary matters orders and I now set out the grounds for my decision.

## Facts of this case

5       The parties are American citizens.

6       The husband is 52 years old and is a Consultant in xxx Pte Ltd. He has been employed in this company since May 2012. This is his company and its principal business activity is Human Resource Consultancy Services. It provides Executive Search Services. The husband has a Juris Doctor degree and his highest education level is a Postgraduate degree. He resides in Singapore and has been resident in Singapore since March/April 2012. The children are currently with him save for the oldest child who has started college and is not Singapore during her academic term. The children’s stay in Singapore is facilitated by Dependant Passes attached to the husband’s Employment Pass.

7       The wife is 50 years old and is a Clinical Social Worker, an Applied Behavior Analysis Therapist and a School Counsellor. The wife holds a Masters Degree in Social Work. In July 2017, she left Singapore for the USA without the husband and the children. The wife remained in the USA from July 2017 and she has not returned to Singapore since. She renewed her licence in social work in New Yok City and obtained a conditional licence in October 2017, enabling her to work.

8       The parties were married in Massachusetts in the USA in November 1999 after a courtship that started when they met in New York in 1998. They have 5 children: Child A born in March 2001 (aged 19), Child B born in October 2003 (aged 16 going on 17); Child C born in June 2005 (aged 15), Child D born in July 2007 (aged 13) and Child E born in November 2009 (aged 11).

9       The husband was relocated to Hong Kong by his employers in May 1999 and the wife joined him in Hong Kong in September 1999. They registered their marriage in November 1999. The husband joined another financial institution and relocated to Tokyo, Japan in July 2001. Unfortunately, his employers went bankrupt and the firm was acquired by another financial institution. This financial institution eventually relocated the husband to London, United Kingdom (UK) in August 2010. The family moved to London.

#### Proceedings in the UK – June 2011 to May 2012, May 2015

10     In June 2011, the wife commenced divorce proceedings in the UK. On 8 June 2011, she obtained an order restraining the husband from dealing with his assets. The order was varied by agreement on 21 June 2011. As the wife placed some significance on the documents produced in the UK proceedings for the ancillary matters, she referred to them in her affidavit of assets and means.[^1]

11     According to the husband, after the hearings in 2011, the relationship improved and parties decided to move away from the UK in favour of Asia. They decided that they should relocate to Singapore. On a visit in Singapore, the wife had to have an operation. She did the operation in Singapore on or about January 2012. She then remained in Singapore. The husband and the children were then in London and relocated to Singapore in March/April 2012 to be with the wife. The family was together in Singapore from March/April 2012.

12     The wife did not address the issue of the attempt to salvage the marriage after the UK proceedings. In her affidavit, she referred to matters occurring in May 2015[^2] with regard the UK orders referred to in paragraph 10 above. She alleged that the husband had breached his undertakings given to the UK courts with regard the freezing of his assets. She did not pursue the alleged breaches citing a lack of funds.

13     The wife said that the proceedings in the UK were adjourned in May 2012. This appears to be consistent with the family’s move to Singapore in March/April 2012. She said that the husband obtained an order for the dismissal of proceedings in the UK in May 2015[^3].

14     The parties did not provide documents of this dismissal.

#### Proceedings in Singapore – guardianship proceedings; applications for personal protection orders (PPO) – January 2013 to October 2013

15     In January 2013, the wife filed applications for PPOs against the husband. However, the application was not proceeded with. In May 2013, there was an altercation between the parties. The parties then decided to mediate their marital differences and appointed an independent mediator. A full day mediation proceeded on 28 May 2013 and parties drafted an agreement on 30 May 2013. Notwithstanding the agreement, on 31 May 2013, the wife left Singapore with the children and remained in the USA without the husband’s prior consent and knowledge. The husband subsequently discovered that the wife and children were in Connecticut, USA.

16     On 10 July 2013, the husband commenced proceedings under the Guardianship of Infants Act Cap 122 (GIA) for, _inter alia_, custody care and control and for the children to be returned to Singapore. In October 2013, the wife challenged the jurisdiction of Singapore and claimed that the USA was the more appropriate forum for the parties’ disputes. In January 2014, the wife filed her cross application in Singapore for custody of the children. In April 2014, pending the outcome of the pending applications, she filed an application for the children to be relocated to the USA.

#### Proceedings in the USA – November 2013 to June 2014

17     The husband located the children in the USA in July 2013. He filed an application in the District Court, District of Connecticut, USA, for the return of the children to Singapore pursuant to a Hague action citing the wife’s wrongful abduction of the children. There were conflicting accounts of what transpired in the USA but pursuant to an order made on 16 April 2014, the wife was to return to Singapore with the children in June 2014. The wife said she had agreed to do so upon certain conditions; the husband said she was ordered to return and that she delayed the return date until 26 June 2014.

#### Resumed proceedings in Singapore – June 2014 to September 2017

18     After the orders made in the proceedings in the USA, the wife withdrew her application for _forum non conveniens_ which she had previously filed. She also did not proceed with the relocation in light of the matters raised above with regard the USA proceedings. Once back in Singapore, a whole slew of applications ensued. A total of about 16 applications were filed with 35 affidavits. The orders pertaining to custody and access of the children were re-visited many times. The children were also assessed by court psychologists for purposes of a report which was submitted to Court in December 2014. However, events overtook the earlier orders and the orders that were in place for the GIA proceedings before the commencement of the divorce proceedings, are summarized:

> (a)     30 June 2014 – Provision of maintenance for the wife and the children and the husband was to make direct payment of certain expenses eg the children’s school fees, rental for accommodation, power supply bills, medical and dental bills. Interim care and control was vested in the wife with interim access terms to the husband pending a Custody Evaluation Report ordered by the Court.

> (b)     13 January 2015 – The Court fixed maintenance at $5,000 per month payable to the wife and the husband was to make direct payment of school fees and medical and dental treatment.

> (c)     29 May 2015 – The husband to be the decision maker for Child D’s health and education issues and for Child E’s school.

> (d)     12 June 2015 – The husband was allowed to travel overseas with the children and the passports were to be retained by his lawyers as stakeholders only to be released to parties for purposes of approved travel.

> (e)     7 July 2016 – Orders made with regard the housing of the children and the accommodations to be provided for the wife and the children. The 2 younger children were to stay with the husband with an option for the 3 older ones to stay with him pending resolution of their accommodation issues. The Court fixed the rental of the accommodations for the wife and the children at $3,000 per month. If the children stayed with the husband, maintenance for them would not need to be paid to the wife.

> (f)     21 June 2017 – Orders that the children remained in Singapore and to have Dependant Passes attached to the husband’s Employment Pass and for the passports to be retained by the husband’s lawyers as stakeholders. Orders pertaining to the education of Child B and for communications between the school and parents to be only with the husband.

> (g)     24 July 2017 – Orders pertaining to the education of Child B and for decisions pertaining to his education to be solely managed by the husband.

> (h)     17 August 2017 – Orders pertaining to the education of Child A and for communications between the school and parents to be only with the husband.

> (i)     20 September 2017 – The husband was to be the primary parent for discussions and decisions pertaining to the children’s education. The children’s passports to be retained by the husband. Renewal of Child A’s passport shall not require the wife’s consent.

19     As a note, in October 2016, the children were sent by the wife to reside with the husband although one or two of them would stay with her sporadically. By July 2017, all 5 children were physically with the husband and he had _de facto_ care and control when the wife left Singapore without them.

#### Divorce proceedings May 2018

20     The husband commenced divorce proceedings in May 2018. There were 4 interim applications filed but the pertinent order relating to the children was made on 12 July 2018. In this order, the wife was to provide her consent for the renewal of the other 4 children’s renewal of Dependant Passes (other than Child A provided under the OSG – see paragraph 18 above). In the event that the wife did not provide her consent, the husband was to renew the Dependant Passes without her consent.

21     A total of 29 affidavits were filed in the divorce file and/or referred to in these ancillary matters proceedings. After hearing parties and dealing with applications for admission of further affidavits, I made the ancillary matters orders on 15 May 2020 taking into account the matters raised in the other 35 affidavits filed in the originating summons as well as considering the matters raised in other applications such as PPO and enforcement of maintenance.

## On the issue of custody care and control and access

22     As set out in paragraphs 18 and 20, there are existing orders for this family from the earlier action _vide_ originating summons applications. The later orders made on September 2017 granted the Plaintiff sole decision making powers over the children’s education, overseas travel, Child D’s medical needs and the children’s travel documents. On 12 July 2018, the husband was granted sole decision making powers to renew the children’s Dependant Passes so that they could remain in Singapore.

#### The husband’s position on custody and access

23     A summary of the husband’s position on the issues of joint versus sole custody is as follows:

> (a)     The husband initially agreed to an order for joint custody but said that the wife’s conduct has made this impossible eg with her interference of the application of Dependant Passes for the children in 2017 and again in 2018 when she sent emails to government agencies alleging some form of mistreatment of the children by the husband. This led to a delay in the children’s schooling as the Ministry of Manpower had to investigate the allegations and did not issue the Dependant’s Passes. He now seeks an order for sole custody.

> (b)     That the wife did not place the children’s welfare as paramount importance when she started a ‘smear’ programme against the husband. The husband was unable to work and had his Employment Pass delayed as a direct result of the wife’s actions.

> (c)     That she left the children with friends when she left for the USA for her medical treatment in July 2017 and that she has not returned to Singapore to see the children since.

> (d)     The wife cited many reasons for not returning to Singapore including blaming the husband but she could have returned as a tourist and she could have stayed in Singapore for up to 90 days. She did not.

> (e)     The wife cited financial reasons as an inability to travel but the husband had made offers to assist the wife which were not taken up.

> (f)     She claimed that she was rendered homeless by the husband who did not complied with orders pertaining to accommodations. This was refuted by the husband who showed supporting evidence that it was the wife who did not find a lease compliant with orders made in July 2016.

> (g)     The wife abducted the children in 2013 without taking into account the children’s welfare, refusing to return the children to Singapore leading to a Hague application by the husband. After the USA courts made orders in April 2014, she delayed their return to Singapore.

> (h)     The wife alleged that the husband abused the orders of September 2017 by not informing her of the children’s whereabouts. This was refuted by the husband who explained in his affidavits the trips undertaken by the children and that the wife’s complaints were unwarranted.

#### The husband’s position on the wife’s application for the children’s relocation to the USA

24     As the wife applied for the children to relocate to the USA and this issue is intrinsically intertwined with the issues of care and control, this is dealt with together and the husband’s position summarized:

> (a)     The wife has not seen the children in Singapore for the last 3 years save on 2 trips to the USA organized by the husband.

> (b)     Her relocation plan does not take into account the welfare of the children as her proposed accommodations are inappropriate or does not take into account the distance the children have to travel to school.

> (c)     The children have never lived in Manhattan or Connecticut.

> (d)     The children have been in his care since mid-2017 and they have lived in Singapore for most parts of their lives. They lived in the USA briefly in 2013 only because of the wife’s abduction of the children.

> (e)     The children have thrived under his care.

> (f)     He is the sole provider for the children. The wife’s plan is to relocate the children and to request maintenance from him when the children have not stayed in the USA.

> (g)     The wife has listed many ailments as set out in her affidavits and it is unclear whether she is in a physically healthy position to care for the children.

> (h)     Even when parties were together she was unable to care for the children for extended periods and she could not manage more than two children at a time.

> (i)     On the other hand, the husband has been managing the children the last 3 years without her.

> (j)     He has received positive feedback about Child D’s progress.

> (k)     He has concerns that the wife will be an obstacle with access if she is granted care and control; conversely, he has shown that he has been and is supportive with access for the wife. If relocation is granted, he seeks terms of access as detailed in his submissions.

#### The wife’s position on relocation, custody and access

25     The wife’s position on relocation, custody, care and control and access is summarized below:

> (a)     The wife is of the view that joint parenting is not workable for them. She referred to the Court of Appeal’s decision which advocated a position of joint parenting but submitted that the 9 years of matrimonial proceedings speak for themselves; that joint parenting is not workable for them.

> (b)     The September 2017 order obtained by the husband was essentially _ex parte_ in nature as her former lawyer did not attend the hearing and in any event, the order did not grant him sole custody.

> (c)     That the husband has not communicated with her pertaining to the children’s issues.

> (d)     That relocation should be granted as she has no family in Singapore, would be financially insecure in Singapore and would not have her support network as contrasted to a position if the children were relocated to the USA and she would be able to care for them.

> (e)     That the husband travels frequently for work and is not with the children whereas her job is flexible and she can be with the children.

> (f)     That she was compelled to return to the USA in July 2017 and that the husband did not assist her to return.

> (g)     That she had been living a hand-to-mouth existence the last few years and she is only paid if she works. She is unable to afford the cost of return airfare to Singapore and hotel accommodation without the husband’s financial assistance.

> (h)     That the husband has been dictating the terms of the children’s contact with her.

> (i)     That she did not abduct the children nor alienate them against the husband in 2013 and that she voluntarily returned to Singapore in June 2014.

> (j)     She relied on the USA court’s transcripts in 2013 and submitted that she was and is the children’s primary caregiver and that the children have a firm attachment to her.

> (k)     That the husband made things difficult for her in 2016 with regard accommodation and schools for the children and she was forced to send the children to live with the husband in October 2016.

> (l)     That the husband does not take the children’s medical treatment seriously.

> (m)     That the husband does not consult with her on the children’s overseas travels and there have been 26 instances in which the children travelled overseas without giving her notice.

> (n)     That the husband himself travels overseas and leaves the children to fend for themselves or to stay with friends whereas she has never allowed the children to sleep at homes of people she has never met.

> (o)     That the husband does not supervise the children adequately eg the children have published inappropriate photographs in swimsuits on social media and posted comments of them committing illegal acts eg by selling morning after pills.

> (p)     That the children have indicated that they want to be with the wife and to relocate to the USA.

> (q)     That the children will have outstanding benefits available to them as USA citizens such as free public school education; that the schools provide 2 healthy meals a day; that one of the children can attend college in the State of New York; that they will have comprehensive healthcare and that the wife will qualify for legal aid to assist her with any legal action that she may need against the husband in furtherance of the children’s welfare.

> (r)     That upon relocation, she will ensure the husband has unlimited electronic access to the children and she will minimize any loss in relationship between the husband and the children.

> (s)     She seeks fixed terms of access if relocation is not granted.

## Court’s decision on the issues of custody care and control and the issue of relocation to the USA

### Joint v sole custody; co-parenting

26     In the seminal decision of _CX v CY (minor: custody and access)_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 3 SLR(R) 690</span>, the Court of Appeal pronounced that a joint custody order would be the norm rather than the exception. In _ZO v ZP and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGCA 24</span> at \[14\] the Court of Appeal endorsed this approach; elaborating that acrimony alone is not sufficient to justify a sole custody order; that the concept of joint parenting is a highly significant concept that not only cannot be ignored but must also be given effect to.

27     There is no doubt that the courts recognise that parents have a lifelong joint parental responsibility to promote their children’s best interest. Hence, notwithstanding bitterness and hatred between the parties, the courts have advocated joint custody orders in the hopes that the warring parents will transcend their marital differences to put the welfare of their children as paramount see eg _ALJ v ALK_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGHC 255</span> and _AZZ_ v _BAA_ \[2016\]SGHC 44.

28     Whilst there is every reason for the courts to order joint custody as a reminder of joint parental responsibility in child cases, regrettably, there are exceptions to the norm. In _Re Aliya Aziz Tayabli_ \[2000\] 1 SLR 754 the Court declined to make a custody order. Michael Hwang JC (as he then was) decided that a joint custody order would be useful symbolically if a parent had an equal say in the long term decisions relating to the child; however, that symbolism could be abused if that parent decided to use the joint custody order to impinge on matters which might more appropriately be left to the decision of the parent having care and control. Even if exercised in good faith, there might be constant disputes.

29     Whilst the cases that follow hold the view that disagreements between parents were not compelling enough not to grant a joint custody order, the circumstances and the facts of this case demonstrate that a joint custody order is not only unworkable but that the wife may more than likely use the order to impinge on matters which might more appropriately be left to the decision of the parent having care and control.

30     This is a case in which an exception to the norm was made as the wife has demonstrated through her conduct and actions that she had failed and/or neglected to consider the impact her conduct and actions had on the children. In doing so, she has not placed the welfare of the children as paramount and she disregarded the children’s best interests.

31     It is also telling that it is the wife’s own submission that the parties had an acrimonious 9-year history of matrimonial proceedings; that several orders have been made before courts of 3 different jurisdictions and in her submissions ‘_that parties are completely unable to cooperate with each other on the children’s matters’_. [^4] She likewise seeks a sole custody order.

32     I agree with the wife that these parties will have very real issues co-parenting. This is not a case in which sole custody is ordered because parties are steeped in acrimony or bitterness; on the facts, the wife has caused serious issues with the children’s welfare thereby necessitating a sole custody order for the husband. I set out some of the specific examples of her conduct and actions which I view as damaging to the children’s welfare.

#### The wife’s conduct and actions which affected the children’s welfare

#### With regard the children’s passports

33     Notwithstanding agreeing to the husband taking a trip with Child D and Child E in June 2015, the wife refused to release the passport for the children’s overseas holidays. The wife refused to release the passport for Child C for purposes of renewal with the USA Embassy in June 2015 causing the passport to expire. The wife refused to release the passport for Child C and this caused her to nearly miss a school trip in May 2017. She then refused to release the passports for Child A and Child C (again) in July and August 2017 causing the passports to expire. There were opportunities accorded to her to consent to the release of the passports for the purposes stated; she refused to co-operate.

34     On these occasions, the husband had to apply to court for the necessary reliefs and he had to institute committal action before the passports were finally released. After 2 years, orders were eventually made for the husband to retain the passports instead of the wife. The wife’s actions prejudiced the children’s welfare.

#### With regard the children’s Dependant Passes

35     The wife had her own reasons for leaving Singapore in July 2017 without the children. The children were left in the husband’s care on Dependant Passes linked to his Employment Pass. Before she left Singapore, the children’s Dependant Passed had to be renewed and the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) asked for her consent. The wife refused her consent and the husband was forced to institute an application in May 2017 to dispense with her consent so that the children could continue to stay on in Singapore.

36     In May 2018, the wife was again asked for her consent for the renewal of the children’s Dependant Passes. Unknown to the husband at the material time, she then sent a series of emails to MOM and other government agencies alleging that the husband had not been caring for the children; refused/neglected them medical treatment; that the husband had committed domestic violence and abused/neglected the children; that the children lived in substandard conditions; that he owed over $160,000 in arrears of maintenance; that she had legal custody care and control of the children and that the husband had obstructed her contact with the children[^5].

37     The husband was able to resolve the issues with MOM after sending them 10 emails with 50 attachments, sending them a summary chart and attending to more follow up emails. But the impact on the children was that Child A was not able to attend school for a month and the husband could not work for 2 months. As he was and is the sole financial provider for the family, this caused the family a great deal of uncertainty. Her actions prejudiced the children’s welfare. I say this because the wife made no attempt to return to Singapore (alleging a lack of funds and co-operation from the husband) and had been prepared to leave the children in Singapore from July 2017. As at the date of her email in June 2018, the children had been with the husband for a year. The wife did not file applications eg for the children to be relocated to the USA nor applications complaining of the matters raised in her email to MOM. What she did and her inaccurate allegations impacted the children’s welfare.

38     Her actions directly led to orders made on 12 July 2018 giving the husband sole decision making with regard the renewal of the children’s Dependant Passes, their housing and living arrangements.

#### With regard to the children’s education

39     In January 2015, the husband raised issues with the wife pertaining to Child D’s treatment for speech and occupational therapy as the wife did not send the said child for these sessions. The parties also could not agree on the schools for Child D and Child E. The wife objected to the allegations claiming that she had insufficient monies. This was notwithstanding the fact that there were existing orders for maintenance. The parties filed affidavits in the originating summons proceedings to have the issues adjudicated. After hearing parties, on 29 May 2015, the court made an order that the husband was to be solely responsible for issues pertaining to Child D’s schooling, medical and other needs. In the same order, the court also granted the husband the decision-making powers for determining Child E’s school. The words in the order are significant: ‘_to enrol Child E in a school of his (the husband’s) choice with immediate effect’_.

40     The wife continued to be obstructive when it came to issues pertaining to the children’s education. She could not agree on the choice of schools and she emailed the children’s schools on the parties’ personal and marital issues. She alleged in affidavits that the husband was moving then children to different schools to their detriment. Again, the parties had to bring their differences to court and this resulted in a series of orders which favoured the husband. On 21 June 2017, the court ordered that husband was to be the only parent with whom the school dealt with for Child B. On 24 July 2017, the orders were expanded pertaining to the education of Child B and for decisions pertaining to his education to be solely managed by the husband. On 17 August 2017, orders were made for the communications between the school and parents to be only with the husband with respect to Child A. On 20 September 2017, orders were made for the husband to be the primary parent for discussions and decisions pertaining to the children’s education.

41     The wife’s disagreements with the husband were often focused on unproven allegations of abuse and a lack of adequate funds. I say this because her application for a PPO was dismissed (in March 2015)[^6] and one other application was not proceeded with or abandoned by her. As for the allegation of maintenance arrears (she alleged $160,000 of arrears to MOM), her complaints were struck out for want of prosecution or abandoned by her[^7]. However, by not resolving issues pertaining to the children’s education, she was hurting the children’s welfare.

#### With regard to the children’s physical care

42     Notwithstanding an order that she was to have care and control of the children, the care of the two younger children shifted to husband (see court orders summarized in paragraph 18). The husband said she had difficulties managing all 5 children; she alleged that he did not provide adequate housing causing her to have accommodation issues. The housing issues were raised in the numerous affidavits filed in the originating summons and resolved in orders made. Regardless of the allegations levied one against the other, I make one point here: in July 2017, the wife left for the USA, leaving the children behind. There was no arrangement made for their care to be vested with the husband; rather the children were left in residences she had unilaterally chosen amongst her friends in Singapore, one of whom was a drug user and known to be reliant on tranquilizers and sleeping pills. This friend was subsequently jailed for drug related offences[^8]. The friend’s address was the one used for the delivery of the wife’s purchases of tranquillizers and sleeping pills[^9].

43     The wide disregarded the children’s welfare when she left them in Singapore without ensuring proper care arrangements.

#### Concluding remarks on the issue of custody

44     When considering long-term decisions pertaining to children as envisaged with a joint custody order, the common areas for discussion and collaboration between parents relate to the 3 major areas of education, health and religion and sometimes, the children’s residence.

45     Both parties have not raised an issue with the children’s religious affiliations and it appears that the children are being brought up in the Jewish faith. The wife said that the boys have not had their Bar Mitzvah[^10] but the husband said otherwise and this is also in Child A’s affidavit[^11].

46     As for the issues of education, health and residence, the several court orders between 2015 and 2018 have placed these important parenting decisions squarely with the husband. I detailed above how over time the husband was accorded these decision-making powers especially in the face of the wife’s inadequate responses or failure to consider the children’s welfare. Taking into account the history of this case and the reasons why those orders were made, the decision to award the husband sole custody now gives effect to the existing orders.

47     The wife is not deprived of all information concerning the children. She does not need a joint custody order to be a parent. The husband is ordered to keep the wife informed of important aspects of the children’s lives in terms of education, health and residence. As for the children’s status in Singapore, as Child B raised a concern about acquiring Singapore Permanent Residence and his potential liability for National Service, the husband is to consider his wishes in this area.

## Care and Control

48     The issues of care and control are intertwined with the wife’s prayer for the children to be relocated to the USA. I had set out a summary of the parties’ positions on the issues in paragraph 24 (the husband) and paragraph 25 (the wife) and I do not propose to regurgitate the reasons. I will set out my reasons for granting the husband care and control and why I dismissed the wife’s relocation application.

#### Care and control vested in the husband

49     After the wife and the children returned to Singapore in June 2014, a myriad of applications were filed with regard the children’s issues. The wife was granted care and control in the USA orders which parties were to mirror in Singapore. However, by May 2015, Child D was residing primarily with the husband who also had sole decision making powers over issues pertaining to his health and education issues. This is the child whom the wife did not send for therapy sessions citing a lack of funds despite maintenance orders made taking into account the costs of therapy. By July 2016, Child E also stayed primarily with the husband. In October 2016[^12], the wife sent the other children to stay with the husband sporadically. In July 2017, when she left Singapore, the children lived with the husband where they continue to be to this day.

50     Notwithstanding her actions above, the wife has raised issues with the husband’s care of the children. She did not however filed applications for the children to be relocated to be with her in July 2017, through 2018 and 2019 up to the ancillary matters in 2020. Although she raised issues with their care, these issues did not seem so insurmountable to the extent that she needed the court’s intervention for the past 4 to 5 years from May 2015. Rather than addressing these allegations, she exercised remote parenting and undermined the husband’s care of the children rather subversively through her texts with them as well as in her ancillary affidavits and submissions.

51     I deal with some of the allegations she made and my findings:

> (a)      The wife took no action to remove the children from the husband whom she described as having ‘_narcissistic and psychopathic character disorders_’ which led to the children and her suffering ‘_unfathomable abuse’_[^13]. These allegations are serious in nature but the wife certainly did not deem it fit to return to Singapore or to have her lawyers deal with this alleged ‘narcissistic psychopathic’ parent by removing the children from him and the alleged abusive environment.

> (b)     The wife said that she could not come to Singapore because the husband did not renew her Dependant Pass. There are disputes concerning this issue but the point to be made is that in the last 3 years, the wife did not return to Singapore to assume care and control of the children. She could easily enter Singapore as a tourist and stay on for 90 days and she could have obtained a long-term social visit pass as care and control parent. She did not do so. Further, she rejected proposals by the husband to return to Singapore with specific dates for her visits, proposals for her accommodations and her flights[^14]. Her allegations of being without financial support would have been resolved with her pursuing her claim for the alleged arrears of maintenance. She did not do so although she did have solicitors on record.

> (c)     Child D was diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum with sensory integration disorder when he was about 3 to 4 years old. This meant that he found it difficult to process information received through the senses which created challenges for him to perform everyday tasks. The wife raised issues that Child D was not cared for properly by the husband who allegedly forgot to give Child D his medication and this led him to become violent with his siblings as well as people he met. She raised issues with his development and said that she did not have updated information about him. However, the wife found it so challenging to deal with Child D that his care was relegated to the husband in an order made in May 2015.

> I make a comment here about paragraph 138 of the wife’s DAOM[^15]. In this paragraph, the wife said she found it ‘_most difficult to stomach….DJ Shobha Nair’s total disregard for all the experts’ assessment_..’ pertaining to Child D when the judge made the orders in May 2015 to relegate sole decision-making powers to the husband for issues relating to Child D’s health and education issues. Not only did I find this statement inappropriate, the wife, despite her strongly worded statement, took no steps to appeal or vary the orders in the last 5 years. To now make this statement in her ancillary matters affidavit lacks propriety and conviction.

> It is pertinent to note that Child D has been in the husband’s sole care for the last 5 years. Under his care, Child D is currently in his 6th year of his school (which caters to his special needs) and he excelled to the extent that he was awarded a scholarship. He is involved in the wrestling team and has done well. The husband has received praise of Child D’s progress from a Senior Teacher and Child D’s wrestling coach has also commented on how well Child D has thrived under the husband’s care[^16]. The husband also tendered a video of Child D addressing his class which showed that Child D has overcome a lot of his challenges and he is doing well despite his earlier diagnosis.

> The wife’s recollection of a child who was difficult to manage and violent is mired in her version of the events in 2013 and 2014; she has not and will not recognised Child D’s incredible achievements and progress under the husband’s care. She is not known to the school neither the parents nor teachers as she has not once contacted the school whether by email or a phone call to ask about Child D.

> (d)     The wife alleged that the children lacked parental supervision and in particular she commented that Child A was running wild and this also affected Child C. She monitored their social accounts and submitted that Child A’s behaviour would have an impact on her college application as she has not been accepted into any private college[^17]. Child A has filed an affidavit in these proceedings[^18]. The affidavit speaks for itself. It is also not true that she is not doing well. Child A completed her International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma from the United World College and was accepted into 4 universities with an additional university offering her a scholarship. She has since started university. As for Child C, she is also on track to do her IB Diploma. The wife’s allegation is not borne out on the facts.

> The husband has replied to the wife’s submission of the 2 children’s social media posts in his submissions when he rebutted to an allegation that there were photographs of the girls ‘_half-naked_’ - the 2 girls were wearing swimsuits by a poolside and he did not think the photographs inappropriate in the context[^19] and they were not ‘_half-naked’_ in the circumstances.

> (e)     As for Child B, he has also filed an affidavit[^20]. However, there is also no dispute that he is likewise on track for his IB Diploma; that he has a relationship with both parents and that he appreciates the efforts made by his father to provide for them although he also wants his mother. Those are legitimate sentiments and whether or not he remains in Singapore is something that the husband will have to discuss with Child B as Child B has also raised concerns about having to serve National Service if the husband applied for permanent residency status for him. The point to be made here is that Child B has likewise thrived under the husband’s care and the husband has bene instrumental in arranging his contact with his mother in the USA over the past summer holidays.

> (f)     The wife has a host of medical ailments and it is not clear if she is in a position to care for the children. According to her, she suffers from fibromyalgia, chronic back problems and other medical problems[^21]. She is living with her boyfriend and proposes that the children live with him and his children from his marriage or in subsidized housing she hopes to apply for if the children relocate. She has not cared for all 5 children together since 2015 – 5 years.

> (g)     That the husband travels frequently for work and is not at home with the children. The husband has replied to this he travels an average of once per month for a few days. The rest of the time he works from home and is there for the children. This has been the case since July 2017. He also rebutted the wife’s allegation about the period of 46 days’ travel over a 13 month period[^22].

52     Having considered the children’s welfare, the husband’s care of them and the wife’s submissions, I am of the view that the children are to remain in his care. A consideration of all the factors and what transpired over the past 5 years from the orders made in May 2015 underscore the fact that the husband has done well with regard the children’s care. Further, notwithstanding the wife has not shown that she would work with the husband over parenting issues, it is noteworthy that the husband ensured that the children maintain a relationship with her as evidenced by their many conversations and contact with her and their travels to the USA to see her as arranged by the husband.

## Relocation to the USA

53     Having granted sole custody care and control to the husband, I next consider whether it would still be in these children’s best interests to relocate to the USA. The husband, the parent with sole custody care and control, having weighed the pros and cons, do not think this relocation to be in their best interests. His wishes are pertinent in view of the facts of the case.

54     The wife has also set out her reasons why it would be advantageous for the children to relocate to the USA. It is not clear whether her prayer for them to relocate is dependent on her having sole custody care and control; the submissions indicate this to be the case. Hence, as she does not have sole custody nor care and control _a fortiori_ the relocation issue is moot.

55     However, for completeness, I set out the reasons why relocation failed for this wife in this case with this particular set of circumstances and facts.

#### Prevailing legal principles

56     Both parties have referred to the seminal decision of _BNS v BNT_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 973</span> in which the Court of Appeal held that the one fundamental, critical legal principle in considering relocation applications was that the welfare of the child is paramount and that this principle ought to override any other consideration. The Court of Appeal also considered as important the child’s loss of relationship with the left-behind parent as a child would benefit from the nurturing presence and joint contribution of both parents in his or her life notwithstanding the dissolution of the marriage[^23].

#### Incontrovertible facts

57     I deal firstly with what are incontrovertible facts:

> (a)     In the course of the marriage, the children lived in Japan, the UK and for the period of the wife’s removal of them to the USA; the USA. They have lived in Singapore from the 1st quarter of 2012 (April). From April 2012 to May 2020, they have lived in Singapore here for 8 years less a period of about 10 to 12 months when they were brought to the USA by the wife = 7 years. This is not disputed.

> (b)     The children have lived in Singapore for the most parts of their lives.

> (c)     The children have not resided in the USA for longer than the time taken to resolve the USA proceedings. When they were removed by the wife from Singapore, it was not a joint decision for this trip to the USA to be a permanent move nor were they to make it their home.

> (d)     Since July 2017, all 5 children have been in the husband’s sole care in Singapore - 3 years in July 2020.

> (e)     Child D has been under the husband’s care in Singapore since May 2015.

> (f)     The children are educated in Singapore and they are all on track in their various programmes and doing reasonably well. The husband has detailed their education plans in his 2nd ancillary matters affidavit and this chart is comprehensive[^24] in its summary.

> (g)     Over the past 7 to 8 years, the children have established a network of friends, coaches, teachers and religious leaders in Singapore.

> (h)     The family is part of a close-knit Jewish community here and the Jewish community assists with the children’s school fees.

> (i)     The husband and the children have the assistance of a helper who was with the family in 2012 and then re-joined the husband’s household from 2016. She takes care of the household chores and assists with the care of the younger children from 2016.

> (j)     The children live in a private condominium and have a reasonable standard of living despite being only reliant on the husband as their sole provider. They have also managed holidays and breaks and attend reputable international schools

#### The wife’s submission on relocation and my findings

58     Having dealt with the issues of custody care and control and the incontrovertible facts above, I now deal with the wife’s case for relocation and my findings.

59     The wife raised the following matters.

> (a)      That she has been the children’s primary caregiver and the court documents in the USA proceedings substantiate this. Whilst there may be come historical basis for that submission, this is no longer true from 2015 for Child D, from October 2016 for the other children when she sent the children to stay with the husband and from July 2017 when she relinquished all care to the husband and left Singapore without them.

> (b)      That the husband practises unsupervised parenting. I have dealt with this in paragraphs 48 to 52 above. I do not think it behoves the wife who chose to parent remotely from the USA to make this submission. She does have a choice to parent her children and to supervise them physically if she has concerns. She chose not to exercise that choice.

> (c)      That Child D’s development has been compromised in Singapore and that he would have the treatment that he requires available to him as a human right in the USA and his right as an American citizen[^25]. I have dealt with this in paragraph 51(c) above. I do not see that Child D’s development has been affected by his stay in Singapore these past 7 years and the independent evidence produced by the husband shows that he is thriving and doing well. Child D received speech therapy in his present school from 2015, had a full Speech and Therapy Assessment in 2017 and was discharged from speech therapy in June 2019 as his needs could be met in a classroom setting[^26].

> It may well be the case that the husband obtains a progress report and update the wife but on the facts, Child D’s development was not compromised as postulated by the wife. The wife certainly did not raise concerns for the last 5 years nor act on her concerns eg with applications to court. I had earlier said that she compromised the children’s welfare by making allegations about the children not receiving medical treatment in her complaint to MOM[^27]. The authorities likewise investigated her complaint and found it lacking in substance when they granted the husband’s application for the children’s continued stay in Singapore.

> (d)      That the children will have free education in the USA and they have to return to the USA immediately to establish residency status to benefit from in-state tuition[^28]. It is not immediately clear that the children will have free education as they have to satisfy residency requirements. The wife herself submitted that Child A would not have the benefit as she was starting college/university in August 2019 and there was insufficient time to establish residency. There appears therefore to be a restriction to the free education claimed by the wife.

> The wife then said the children would be placed in public schools and it is only at my direction that she identified the schools (although there was no clarity that there would be places for the children). Alternatively, she hoped for scholarships for them to enter private schools. The children would have to travel quite a distance to go to school bearing in mind the wife’s living arrangements and again it was after my prompt that she said she would look for rental accommodations nearer the schools.

> The wife’s submissions on the children’s education was not convincing for the reasons stated above. There is no guarantee of free education, there is no confirmation of appropriate schools for the other 4 children and the wife pins her hopes of private schools on the children obtaining scholarships.

> I refer to the husband’s chart at page 12 of his P2AM[^29]. The children are settled in reputable schools and on track in the IB Diploma programme for the older children. They are doing well and are also involved in a host of extra-curricular activities.

> I therefore cannot agree that displacing them from schools they have been doing well in to attend an uncertain free education in the USA of either private or public schools to be in their welfare.

> (e)      The wife’s living arrangement in the USA. The wife is staying with her boyfriend (at a reduced rental) and the boyfriend has his own children. When asked about this, the wife submitted that the boyfriend’s two children will be away during the summer and in any event staying in a separate part of the house. She also hopes to apply for subsidized housing in due course. When prompted, she said that she would rent suitable accommodations but she would require maintenance from the husband. The wife’s proposed living arrangement for the children was unsatisfactory as she would be dependent on a third party or wait to be eligible for subsidized housing. I do not think that the children who have been living in relatively comfortable accommodations in Singapore should be displaced to uncertain living accommodations.

60     Having considered the incontrovertible facts of the case as set out in paragraph 57 above and all the circumstances of this case, I do not agree that it will be in these children’s best interests to be relocated to the USA. That decided, it does not appear that the wife intends to return to Singapore to ‘fight’ for care and control of the children; her case revolves around the children being relocated into her care in the USA.

61     I also considered the other matters raised by the parties. I agreed that the husband should not have to uproot himself or the children to re-start in the USA. The husband has established a presence in Singapore and Asia with regard his company and fit would not be viable for him to re-start in the USA which parties left in 1999, more than 20 years ago. It is pertinent to note that the husband is the family’s sole provider and it would be unrealistic for the family to expect him to uproot his business and contacts in Asia to re-start in the USA and for the wife to demand the financial support she has claimed.

62     There is also a grave concern that if relocated, there is a very real risk of the husband losing his relationship with the children if the husband stayed in Singapore and the children stayed with the wife in the USA. The wife has not shown by her conduct how she would promote contact between the children and the husband and I have set out the reasons for my saying so in dealing with the issues of custody, care and control. When she left with the children to the USA in 2013, she obstructed his contact with the children and alleged that he was abusive and violent thereby limiting his contact with them. The husband was forced to deal with these allegations before contact was established with the children.

63     I add this additional point. The wife takes great pains to reiterate again and again that she did not abduct the children in 2013 and that the USA courts did not make that finding. I asked counsel point blank not to skirt around the issue or argue about semantics. The facts show that the family was living in Singapore from April 2012. Singapore was chosen by the wife in the family’s decision to move to Asia. The wife left Singapore in 2013 with the children for a holiday in the USA but with a clear intent not to return. She rented accommodation to house the children and her in the USA and she registered the children for schools. The husband had to institute applications for their return which the wife resisted. The wife then filed applications on _forum non conveniens_ in Singapore as well as for the children to be relocated to the USA whilst remaining in the USA. The husband never agreed that the children should remain in the USA when the wife took them to the USA for a holiday. To all intents and purposes, she removed the children from their place of habitual residence and stayed in the USA against the husband’s wishes and without his prior consent.

## Access to the wife

64     With regard the issue of the wife’s access, she asked for access during their summer holidays for 6 weeks at the husband’s costs which she estimates to be in the region of $14,500. During the December/January holidays, she would like 16 days with them in Thailand again at the husband’s costs which she estimates to be $12,400; alternatively in Singapore at his costs of about $16,000.

65     The husband’s position on the wife’s access is premised on the location of access and the age(s) of the children. The husband is cautious having had to litigate the return of the children from the USA between 2013 and 2014. His premise for the proposal puts these safeguards in place.

66     After considering the submissions, I agreed with the husband’s proposals as being the least disruptive to the children. I also agreed that he should not be paying for the children and the wife for a holiday in Thailand and for the various activities which she wants to sign them up for when they do see her in the USA. Whilst signing them up for summer camps may be edifying for the children, the whole context of access is for the wife to have contact with the children. The wife has said she has flexible work hours and can attend to them. This would be the perfect opportunity for her to do so. If she prefers that they attend courses and classes during their summer holidays, then it will have to be on her own costs.

67     The husband’s access proposal links the issue of the wife’s maintenance as he has sought a contribution from her with regard the children’s maintenance. I will not be considering the wife’s maintenance with the issue of access as submitted by the husband. The issue of maintenance will be considered separately.

68     Access orders will be modified but broadly in accordance with paragraph 28 of the husband’s Final Written Submissions set out hereafter.

> _Orders for access_

> _(Plaintiff is the husband and Defendant is the wife)_

> (1)     The Defendant is to have access to the 4 younger children as follows:

>> (a)       Liberal access in Singapore subject to giving to the Plaintiff 1 month’s written notice of her intention to exercise access with her itinerary including flight details and accommodations. Access shall not be taken overnight during the children’s school terms. The Defendant shall have overnight access on weekends and during the children’s school holidays.

>> (b)       Access in New York, USA during half of the summer holidays when the child attains the age of 14 and upon giving the Plaintiff 1 month’s written notice of the dates of proposed access, the itinerary including flight details and accommodations as well as contact details.

>> (c)       Before the child attains the age of 14, day access in New York, USA with an older sibling, for half the summer school holidays subject to access being supervised in a facility to be determined by the Plaintiff and the parties bearing the costs of supervision as to 75% by the Plaintiff and 25% by the Defendant. The Defendant is at liberty to propose the venues for the Plaintiff’s consideration.

>> (d)       All handovers in New York, USA, shall be carried out by the Plaintiff’s representative and the children’s passports shall be retained by the Plaintiff’s representative who shall furnish his contact details to the Defendant. The children will have copies of their passports with them for purposes of identification only.

>> (e)       Access exercised by the Defendant shall be at her costs whether in Singapore or in New York, USA.

> (2)     The Defendant shall arrange access with the eldest child directly and access shall be subject to the eldest child’s wishes.

> (3)     All other additional access terms to be agreed between the parties.

> (4)     The Defendant shall have remote access to the children to be arranged with the Plaintiff for the younger children and with the child directly if the child is at least 14 years. If the child is not with the Plaintiff and with the Defendant during access, the Plaintiff shall be at liberty to contact the child(ren) any time as long as the last contact is one hour before their bed time according to the time zone of the country they are in.

## Issue of the wife’s maintenance and the husband’s claim for a contribution of maintenance for the children

#### The husband’s position

69     The husband is a Consultant with xxx Pte Ltd and declared a gross monthly income of about $10,600. His expenses for himself and the 5 children amount to about $16,500 per month[^30]. He is able to make ends meet because he has no car and no additional luxuries, the school fees for Child E is currently waived as he is supported from the trusts established for the Jewish community. He also relies on monies from what he submitted are pre-marital assets (discussed further).

70     The husband seeks a contribution of $5,000 per month from the wife towards the children’s maintenance. He does not propose to pay maintenance to the wife. He disputes the wife’s declared income and submits that for a highly qualified person such as the wife, she should not be only earning US$3,000 per month. The wife has submitted that she makes US$80 per hour and for her to declare an income of US$3,000 per month means that she is only working 10 hours a week. He submits that with her qualifications and experience, she can earn up to US$15,000 per month.

#### The wife’s position

71     The wife says that her income is about US$2,000 to US$3,000 per month and that her expenses are in the region of US$3,750 per month[^31] which is commensurate with the standard of living that she enjoyed as a trailing spouse. She submits that she lives a hand to mouth existence and that her bank statements support her submissions.

72     She does not agree with the husband’s declaration of his income and alleges that he must earn at least $16,000 per month because of the rental he pays and the expenses he has declared. This is despite the fact that 2 of the children are on scholarships as the husband would have to pay for the eldest child’s college fees.

73     In the circumstances, she claims US$2,000 per month as maintenance to assist her with her expenses in New York City. She said that she is unable to contribute maintenance for the children as requested by the husband in view of her income and expenses.

## Decision on maintenance

74     The parties effectively separated in April 2012 after having being married for 13 years (married in 1999). Upon her return to Singapore with the children in June 2014, orders were put in place for accommodations and maintenance but this did not stop the wife from leaving Singapore in July 2017 without the children. Since her return to the USA, she has built up an impressive resume and supports the courts in the USA as a therapist and a counsellor amongst ad hoc jobs. The income she earns appear to be on the low side bearing in mind that she does not have to take care of the children and can potentially take on more jobs.

75     I also considered her expenses to be on the high side. She stays with her boyfriend who is charging her rental of US$1,000 per month which is about half to one third of her income. There is no supporting evidence that she is separately paying utilities of US$85 per month and internet charges (with her telephone) at US$220 per month. Her personal expenses such as gym, grooming, gym, clothes and shoes amount to US$700 per month and some of these are not necessities. There is also no evidence that she incurs US$205 per month for seminars and classes on a monthly recurring basis and considering her wealth of experience, it is not clear what these classes and seminars are. I would say that her reasonable expenses are in the region of US$2,000 to US$2,500 and these expenses can be met with her income.

76     With that in mind, I am not minded to order maintenance for her especially when my order is for the husband to continue to maintain the children without her support. That being the case, I will not order the husband to pay or contribute for the wife to come to Singapore to see the children. I am of the view that she can afford this on her income. If the husband wishes to contribute to her trips to Singapore, this will be entirely at his discretion as his offer comes from his wish to have the children maintain contact with the wife. This order will also ‘set off’ application by the husband for the wife to contribute towards the children’s maintenance.

77     As the wife has been building her employability since her return, she can pay for the children’s expenses when they are in the USA for access. If she decides to enrol them in summer courses, she should not expect the husband to pay.

78     As for the children’s university fees, the husband has undertaken to pay this from his pension or retirement funds. This is discussed further (below). He is already solely paying the eldest child’s fees. He has asked for a contribution towards the children’s maintenance but whilst I have some reservations about the income she has declared, I am granting the wife time to build up her financial reserves and as such, there is always liberty to the husband to apply for a contribution of the children’s maintenance and university fees as and when appropriate. There is, after all, always liberty for both parties to apply and it would be fact dependent eg as to where the other children attend university and how much the fees are etc.

## The issue pertaining to the division of assets

#### Length of marriage; general observations

79     The parties married in 1999 and separated in April 2012. The marriage subsisted some 13 years before proceedings ensued in the UK, the USA and in Singapore. As stated earlier, the parties have been litigating for the last 8 odd years over issues primarily pertaining to the children and to a lesser extent, the financial issues. The length of marriage to IJ (August 2018) is 19 years but the marriage effectively subsisted 13 years before the launch of various proceedings and the parties’ separation.

80     During the marriage, the wife said she was the primary caregiver for the children and that the husband was then the primary breadwinner. The husband said he was also involved in the children’s care from their births. This would be for the period of 1999 to 2014. From 2015, the husband had enlarged time with the children leading to full care with effect from July 2017.

81     Although the husband was the primary breadwinner during the marriage, the wife worked as well and in 2013 proceedings she stated that she worked as a clinical social worker. The husband has also shown that the wife continued to work as set out in affidavits filed for the originating summons and the wife would prevail upon him to care for the children as she had to attend to clients for their therapy or counselling sessions. Upon her return to the USA in July 2017, the wife renewed her licence and worked. This was this a dual income marriage.

82     The wife has conceded that she did not made any direct financial contributions to the acquisition, improvement and/or maintenance of the assets.

#### Parties’ positions on the matrimonial assets

83     With these observations, I set out the parties’ positions on the matrimonial assets (MA).

84     The wife submits that the MA amount to US$1,807,264.58 + US$2,319.87 per month + GBP793,161.84 comprising assets as listed in page 2 to 5 of the wife’s Further Written Submissions[^32]. Her values are premised on the husband bearing the full responsibility for the mortgage of a property at Olive Street (discussed further), rental income she claims was not declared, retrenchment benefits, retirement plans, disposal of shares, monies in bank accounts and personal belongings. She claims a share of 40% of the value of the assets and alleges that there has been material non-disclosure by the husband (including values of his company and rentals collected for Olive Street) justifying an order that she is to be entitled to all the husband’s assets as valued by her.

85     The husband submits that the assets comprise his 3 retirement plans of which 1 is a pre-marital asset and not amenable to division; the other 2 are to be used for the children’s university fees and in any event, the wife did not contribute to them. He further submitted that the allegations pertaining to the sale of Olive Street are not borne out; that he has declared his income and shown the audited accounts of his company; that he has declared the value of the retirement plans and explained in affidavits what happened to the monies. He seeks an order that each party retains his or her own assets as a result.

86     In view of the polarized positions, I will go through each asset and set out my findings. The assets are as follows:

> (1)     Property at Olive Street (forced sale in March 2018)

> (2)     The husband’s company and shares in the company

> (3)     Personal belongings amounting to GBP33,717.10

> (4)     Goldman Sachs Retirement Plan

#### (1)   Property at Olive Street

87     The parties owned this property in 2006 which they bought for US$700,000 or thereabouts with a mortgage of US$520,000[^33]. In 2013, the outstanding mortgage was about US$495,686. It was foreclosed and sold for US$655,000 in March 2018. The wife said that the property foreclosed because the husband failed to pay the mortgage but pocketed the rentals from the property of an unknown amount. The wife alleged that the husband forged her signature on mortgage documents. She asked the court to draw an adverse inference against the husband and for him to be solely responsible for the mortgage. At the same time, she claimed rentals collected of US$4,000 per month between June 2008 and June 2017 and she seeks a sum of US$432,000 (being rentals collected over this timeframe) to be included in the pool of MA as a result. The wife said this was their matrimonial home.

88     The husband said this was not the parties’ matrimonial home as they never stayed in it. The property was bought for a sum of US$713,000 with a mortgage of about US$520,000. In the UK proceedings, he had already highlighted that the property had a negative equity. In 2013, the interest rates had gone down and the parties wanted to re-finance the loan but their application was rejected. The husband referred to the document dated 16 Match 2017 in his P3AM[^34] evidencing that the amount that had to be paid for the mortgage was US$690,552.67. Less the sale price, there was a loss of US$35,500 or thereabouts. As such, there is no value to divide.

89     The husband further said that the wife refused a short sale in 2017 and because the mortgage payments were not made, this led to the forced sale. The husband submits that the wife caused the shortfall/loss because of her refusal in 2017.

90     As for the rentals, it was not US$4,000 per month as alleged by the wife. Between 2008 and 2013, there was a shortfall of US$500 per month as on top of mortgage payments, there were tax payments and management fees. The mortgage was US$4,877.55 per month and rental was $3,500 per month. The mortgage was not paid between 2014 and 2016 and according to the husband, there was about US$15,000 to US$25,000 in the mortgage account (accumulated because of non-payment of the mortgage). Documents evidencing this were produced in his P3AM[^35]. The husband submitted that that the amounts in the mortgage account were offset by the losses incurred by the property of well over US$30,000 and there is therefore nothing to divide.

#### Decision on Olive Street property

91     The parties never stayed in the property and it was not the matrimonial home. It was an asset acquired during the marriage for investment purposes. The marriage started to break down with proceedings commenced in the UK in 2011 and then in the USA in 2013/2014. The property was referenced in the husband’s UK filing in 2013 and even as far back as 2013, he recorded that the property had a negative value. It was not unreasonable for mortgage payments to stop between 2014 and 2016 when parties were in litigation as the husband expected the property to be liquidated.

92     The wife did not respond to the submission that she could have agreed to a short sale in 2017 but refused to.

93     The property was sold at a loss. The values set out the parties reflect that the property’s value did not gain the traction the parties hoped for. There is no dispute that the property was sold at a loss. I do not agree that the mortgage sum was to be put back into the pool of MA or attributed as the husband’s asset to be divided. The wife did not manage the property, did not assist with payments and conceded that she made no direct financial contributions. The 20% downpayment came from the husband and the loss was greater to him in the circumstances. The property was collateral damage in a marriage that fell apart from 2011, briefly recovered and spiralled downhill from April 2012.

94     The only positive value to this property was the sum of US$15,000 to US$25,000 collected from rentals when mortgage was not paid and declared by the husband in March 2017. This by itself is not a value as it was ‘created’ with the non-payment of the mortgage. There is no unaccounted rental of US$432,000 as alleged and claimed by the wife. The wife failed to take into consideration the payment of mortgage prior to 2014, the associated costs and expenses such as taxes for the property etc. The claim by the wife is unwarranted as it disregards outgoings.

95     At best, the sum of US$15,000 to US$25,000 existed in March 2017. However, bearing in mind that the husband was and remains the sole financial provider for this family and given the passage of time, I accept that the monies have been used by the family or to offset the losses.

96     I find that there is therefore no value in the property and no credence to the submission by wife for the entire mortgage and rentals to be added into the pool of MA.

#### (2)   The husband’s company and shares in the company

97     The wife submits that there is a value in the husband’s company which is not disclosed, eg shares in the company and that there are monies earned by the husband from the company.

98     The husband submits that monies earned from the company are translated into income to him and he exhibited payslips in his PAOM[^36]. His income is also reflected in his Notices of Assessments and he furnished these as well[^37]. As for the allegation of a value in the company, the husband says there is no value as he is the only employee and the company holds no physical asset. He has also furnished 3 years of audited accounts to the wife in September 2019 pursuant to a discovery request.

#### Decision on the husband’s company and value thereof

99     The husband’s company deals with executive search and job placements and as such, the only asset is his contacts and expertise in the area. This is translated to his income for which he supports the children. The claim by the wife is without merit especially when she has been given the documents in support. She is unable to point the court to ‘hidden’ assets and casting aspersions without evidence is not helpful. She should not pursue this in her submissions in the hope of deriving a benefit when there is none. I find that there is no value in the husband’s company.

#### (3)   Personal belongings amounting to GBP33,717.10

100    The wife that there is a value to personal belongings as declared by the husband in December 2013 (to the courts in the UK). The husband had declared household furnishings, artwork, cameras, computers and stereo sets amounting to GBP33,717.10[^38]. The wife also raised an issue with jewellery items.

101    The husband submits that there is no such value as the wife received half of these items in June 2014 as part of the condition for the return to Singapore in the Hague case (in the USA proceedings). The husband said that the wife informed him that her ‘silver’ was taken by the helpers. As for the belongings taken by the wife, as far as he knows, these were stored in Old Greenwich in Connecticut and in her previous residence in Hougang in Singapore. This was not disputed by the wife.

#### Decision on personal belongings of GBP33,717.10

102    The wife did not dispute that the personal belongings were divided and that she had taken her share. She did not dispute that husband’s submission that her belongings were in storage. It is unclear why she would continue to claim this sum in the circumstances when it has been dealt with in June 2014 and in any event she did not dispute what the husband had said. The wife refers to historical proceedings and documents which are 6 years out of date and this is not helpful. There is no evidence of this value to be divided in May 2020.

#### (4)   The Goldman Sachs Retirement Plan

103    The wife first raised these retirement plans at a case conference in December 2019. She submits that the husband has not given full disclosure of the values and as such she seeks an ‘uplift’ of a greater share of the known MA.

104    The wife referred again to the husband’s declaration in 2013[^39] in the UK proceedings and say that this retirement plan is a MA that can be divided by way of a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) in the USA. She submitted this plan is a MA because the husband has not shown independent evidence from Goldman Sachs to justify his claim that it is a pre-marital asset. She therefore asserts that the sum of US$594,257.32 (the 401(k) DC plan) and Pension Plan with monthly payout of US$748 per month to be MA and she wants the entire sum transferred to her.

105    The husband disagreed that he has not given disclosure of this retirement plan. The wife first brought this issue up at a case conference in December 2019 and he agreed to disclosure. He provided the documents and information[^40] as at February 2020 (the wife complained that this was in breach of a discovery order to disclose this by January 2020). The husband disclosed this in 2013 with the UK filing, in his P2AM[^41] and in his PFPS.

106    The husband submits this is not a MA as this retirement fund was acquired before the marriage when he worked in New York between July 1989 to May 1999. The benefits accrued in that period. He then moved to Hong Kong in May 1999 and no longer received a contribution. Parties were married in November 1999. The husband left Goldman Sachs in 2001. The dates show this retirement fund was acquired before marriage and in any event not improved by the wife substantially or at all after the marriage. The monthly payout of US$748 per month only commences in December 2032.

#### Decision on Goldman Sachs Retirement Plan

107    The wife’s submission to include this asset as a divisible MA is to refer to the husband leaving Goldman Sachs in 2001 which she says is after the marriage in November 1999. She says there is no independent evidence from Goldman Sachs about the accrual of benefits thereby supporting a position that the husband must have received some benefits during marriage after November 1999 until he left in July 2001.

108    Contrary to what was alleged by the wife, the husband obtained independent evidence from Goldman Sachs from an Administrator who informed him there were no records going back to the periods in question. He also obtained confirmation from the Plan Administrator that the fiscal year was in November; that once an employee worked overseas, it would be quite an exception for him to participate in the plans and there was no reason that the husband would have been granted the exception[^42].

109    To this this, the wife’s submission is to question whether the Plan Administrator is who he says he is.

110    The husband did all he could to obtain confirmation from Goldman Sachs and the wife’s challenge as to the identity of the Plan Administrator is not reasonable especially when an affidavit was filed.

111    I agree that this asset is not a MA and it is not to be added into the pool of MA for division. The dates speak for themselves. This asset was acquired before marriage between July 1989 to May 1999. The husband left the USA for Hong Kong in May 1999. The independent evidence is that he is not an exception for a contribution to be made after he left. The date of marriage was November 1999. Accordingly, no payments could have been made during the period of marriage between November 1999 and July 2001 (when he left Goldman Sachs altogether) and as such it does not fall within the exception of Section 112(10)(a)(i). It is not an asset acquired during the marriage.

112    The wife has conceded that she made no direct financial contributions (DFC) in this marriage. Even if I was wrong and the asset is said to be acquired during the marriage by virtue of its existence after marriage (November 1999) until the husband left Goldman Sachs in 2011, the wife has said she has not in any way contributed financially to its acquisition or improvement. The asset cannot be transformed into a MA because she has not substantially improved the value of this asset so as to bring it into the pool (see Section 112(10)(a)(ii)) for division. I therefore did not include this asset into the pool.

#### (5)   Nomura Retrenchment Benefits 2012

113    The wife submitted this benefit is US$650,000 in her Written Submissions[^43] and in her Further Written Submission[^44] she submits this is GBP167,262.60. As the benefits were received in 2012, she submits this is divisible. She submits that there were additional redundancy benefits and _ex gratia_ compensation received by the husband which improved the sum from GBP123,662.60 to GBP167,262.60 referencing the husband’s Settlement Agreement with Nomura[^45]. The husband declared that the sum received was deposited into bank accounts but the wife said in the absence of supporting documents of the deposit, the husband must have hidden the money away and that the entire sum must be part of the MA. Whilst the husband may have provided some cheque stubs evidencing the use of the monies from his bank accounts, the wife said this did not mean the amounts were for the purposes as described by the husband.

114    The husband said that the monies were received in January 2012 and submitted that the monies were paid into his HSBC bank accounts which were disclosed in the UK proceedings in 2013. He said that the amount was GBP163,662.60 and all but GBP 30,000 would be subject to tax[^46]. After his retrenchment, he did not work for 3 months and he said that the parties lived off his savings in the bank accounts as declared in 2013. As for proof of expenses, he listed out detailed expenses with supporting cheque stubs for the first half of 2012 and amounting to about $250,000[^47] (note: some of the expenses were in GBP and some in S$ and this is an estimate).

#### Decision on Nomura Retrenchment Benefits

115    This is a MA as the monies were received by the husband in January 2012, when parties were married.

116    The wife commenced divorce proceedings in the UK in 2011. She did not work and then decided to come to Singapore in December 2011 with the husband following suit in April 2012. They had moving and relocation costs, accommodation expenses, school fees in international schools for the children, flights and other related expenses. It is more than likely that parties lived off the savings as submitted by the husband as he did not work after his retrenchment for about 3 months.

117    The wife did not say that the husband did not pay for these expense; rather, she disagreed with the expenses. She does not submit eg she paid in any way. However, it cannot be disputed that when the parties came to Singapore, the parties lived in Orchard Road for a couple of months; the children went to summer camps and attended international schools; they had expenses for flights, accommodations and moving costs.

118    I am unable to accept that 8 years later in 2020, this money is still intact and held by the husband somewhere. The wife has no evidence and no counter arguments pertaining to the costs of the family’s expenses and it is not possible to make a finding that this amount as intact and to include the whole sum into the pool. At best, the amounts to be included are the monies in the parties’ respective bank accounts as at date of the Interim Judgment or at date of the hearing of the ancillary matters. The amounts to be included in the pool would therefore be the bank account balances in both parties’ accounts as declared in their respective Affidavits of Assets and Means. The values will be considered for division.

#### (6)   Bank accounts in USA, the UK, Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan

119    These bank balances lead on from the above item as the total declared in the balances according to the wife, amounted to $922,831.37 as at 2013[^48]. The wife’s submission is that the husband has channelled the monies somewhere else or into his company. She also said that there were 2 big payments from the bank accounts amounting to GBP210,000[^49] which were not supported by documents and as such she asked the court to put the entire sum into the pool of MA to be divided. As for the husband’s allegations against her for withdrawing the monies (US$50,000) from their Japanese Citibank bank account, she denies this.

120    The husband’s submission was much the same as for the usage of the Nomura benefits. The husband further submitted that 2 large payments were made totalling GBP210,000 in accordance with a UK court order dated February 2014 thereby reducing the sum by half[^50]. The husband depended on the bank accounts, his income and monies from the sale of shares to pay the expenses of this family for the past 7 to 8 years including costs of litigation in 3 jurisdictions. He listed some of the expenses in his 3rd ancillary matters affidavit which he was able to do by looking at his bank statements for the period[^51] January 2013 to January 2016.

#### Decision on the monies in the bank accounts

121    These are MA and are to be included in the pool of MA to be divided. However, I cannot agree with the wife who relied on historical values without taking into account this family’s expenses. It is not accurate to rely on 2013 figures especially when there is no evidence of any hidden accounts or assets. Bare assertions by the wife do not translate into a finding of fact that the monies must exist somewhere and is still intact with the husband. The wife has not produced any evidence to the contrary and I can only look at the bank balances at date of the Interim Judgment or the date of the hearing of the ancillary matters. There is no cogent evidence of hidden assets or dissipated assets.

122    Further, although the wife said there is no evidence of payment of the sum of GBP210,000, there has not been any action by the UK lawyers to claim the sum. The wife herself filed applications in this court for maintenance and she has not asserted this to be unpaid.

123    I raise another point here. The wife has made the submission that the husband breached the terms of the injunctive orders by withdrawing monies that were declared in 2013 in the UK proceedings.

124    However, it is pertinent to note that the husband filed an application[^52] in the originating summons application on 9 June 2015 for a consent order to withdraw US$207,496 in his HSBC bank account in Jersey and for it to be moved to an account to be established by him at HSBC in Singapore. This flowed from related consent proceedings in the UK courts in April 2015. He also referred to the fact that parties were in dire financial straits as he spent over S$500,000 to return the children to Singapore which exhausted all other liquid assets. The wife agreed that the monies would be used for urgent payments to address pressing needs for the children including: counselling for older 3 children, school fees, therapy for Child D and rent arrears. The wife did not challenge these matters raised by the husband when the application was brought before the court in June 2015.

125    In the circumstances. I cannot agree with the wife that there is this sum of $922,831.37 to be added into the MA. The facts of the case show that the liquid assets were depleted and the withdrawal of GBP210,000 and US$207,496 are known to the wife. The husband has consistently drawn down on the bank balances declared in 2013 to pay the expenses of the family from thence and I cannot agree that there is a sum of $922,831.37 frozen somewhere somehow as alleged by the wife since 2013. The husband has been consistent in his position in 2013, in 2015 and again in the ancillary matters. He has used the monies for the family as the wife is not paying for these expenses.

126    The values of the bank balances which are MA, shall be the amounts as declared in the affidavits of assets and means.

#### (7)   Monies from shares with Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers and/or Nomura

127    The wife submits that the husband declared these shares in 2013 and that he has since sold them. The wife said that the values of disposed shares amount to GBP86,375.12 and that the husband must have hidden the assets or not made full and frank disclosures. She submits this value to be included in the MA.

128    The husband submits that between April and November 2014, the shares were sold and he realised a sum of $286,459. He produced supporting documents and a chart in his 3rd ancillary matters[^53]. He also gave a breakdown of the family’s expenses for a 3 year period after December 2013[^54] and also produced his bank statements for the period.

#### Court’s decision on the value of these shares

129    I adopted the approach for the bank accounts. The shares had been sold in 2014 and their values disclosed. They are MA and will be reflected in the bank account balances as at date of the Interim Judgement or at the date of the hearing of the ancillary matters. There is no reason to doubt the veracity of the husband’s statements. The bank statements[^55] showing the deposits of the receipt of the sale proceeds from the shares have also been produced.

130    Again, I cannot look at historical figures in 2013 and 2014 but look at the expenses of the family and consider the current balances in the accounts. I declined to add in the value submitted by the wife, frozen as at 2013 and as declared in the UK proceedings. Events have very much overtaken the matter.

#### (8)   Retirement plans with Nomura and Lehman Brothers

131    The wife said that the Nomura Securities Pension (managed by Aviva) is worth GBP59,199.72 and the Lehman Brothers 401k Plan managed by Fidelity is worth US$126,007.25[^56]. The wife submits these are MA amenable for division. There are also monthly withdrawals for Nomura paying GBP145.83 per month with effect from November 2032 and Lehman Brothers paying US$1,571.97 with effect from October 2032 (the pension plan).

132    The husband does not dispute that these are MAs. He submits that these should not be divided as he needs to use the 401k and the Nomura Securities Pension to pay the college and university costs for the 5 children. He will be foregoing his retirement entitlement in order to support the children as he cannot trust the wife to do the same.

#### Court’s decision on these plans

133    As the monthly sums have not accrued and cannot be calculated, I do not propose to divide them. However, the 401k and the Nomura Securities Pension are MA and divisible. Whilst I understand the husband’s submission on the need to support the children, the wife is entitled to her share as a former spouse.

## Decision on division of MA

#### Operative date

134    Regarding the valuation of these assets, the Court of Appeal recently reiterated that generally, once an asset is regarded as a matrimonial asset, it ought to be valued as at the date of the ancillary matters, unless a departure is warranted by the facts (_TND v TNC and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 34</span> (“_TND v TNC_”) at \[19\], commenting on _TDT v TDS and another appeal and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 145</span> at \[50\]). Nevertheless, where parties agree that a particular date should be used as the date of valuation of the matrimonial assets, a court should generally adopt that agreed date unless there is good reason not to do so (_TND v TNC_ at \[24\]). I see no reason to depart from the date of the ancillary matters and I have explained why I could not agree with the wife’s values in 2013.

#### Approach

135    The Court of Appeal in _ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span> set out a structured approach (at \[17\]–\[30\]) to determine a just and equitable division of matrimonial assets. This approach may be summarised as follows (see _ANJ v ANK_ at \[22\]–\[26\], \[28\]; _Twiss, Christopher James Hans v Twiss, Yvonne Prendergast_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGCA 52</span> (“_Twiss_”) at \[17\]):

> (a)     express as a ratio the parties’ direct contributions relative to each other, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets;

> (b)     express as a second ratio the parties’ indirect contributions relative to each other, having regard to both financial and non-financial contributions; and

> (c)     derive the parties’ overall contributions relative to each other by taking an average of the two ratios above (the derived ratio shall hereinafter be referred to as the “average ratio”), keeping in mind that, depending on the circumstances of each case, the direct and indirect contributions may not be accorded equal weight, and one of the two ratios may be accorded more significance than the other. Adjustments may also be made taking into consideration other relevant factors under ss 112 or 114(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“WC”).

136    The Court of Appeal in _TNL v TNK_ was, hence, understandably concerned that applying the _ANJ v ANK_ approach to Single-Income Marriages would unduly favour the working spouse over the non-working spouse (at \[44\]):

> Our reconsideration of the _ANJ_ approach in the context of Single-Income Marriages stems from the fact that \[the\] _ANJ_ approach tends to unduly favour the working spouse over the non-working spouse. This is because financial contributions are given recognition under _both_ Steps 1 and 2 of the _ANJ_ approach. Under Step 1, the working spouse in a Single-Income Marriage would be accorded 100% (or close to 100%) of direct contributions. He or she would also be accorded a substantial percentage under Step 2 solely on the basis of his or her indirect financial contributions, and this could well be the case even if he or she made little or no non-financial contributions. On the other side of the equation, this means that the non-working spouse is, in this sense, doubly (and severely) disadvantaged. \[emphasis in original\]

137    The Court of Appeal in _TNL v TNK_ thus excluded the application of the structured approach to long, “Single-Income Marriages” on the basis that it would not be consistent with the philosophy of marriage or its intention in _ANJ_ – which, as mentioned, was to avoid undervaluing indirect contributions in the first place (at \[44\]–\[45\]).

138    I had set out in paragraphs 70 to 82 that this is not a single income marriage nor is there a particularly long marriage as it subsisted 13 years. The wife cannot claim to be a traditional homemaker of a long marriage to claim as a starting point, half the husband’s assets. She also did not play a supporting role like the wife did in _Yow Mee Lan v Chan Kai Buan_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 2 SLR(R) 659</span>_)_ or the homemaker wife who invested wisely in _Lock Yeng Fun v Chua Hock Chye_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 3 SLR(R) 520</span>. The facts of this case show that she had her own career whilst in Singapore and she re-invested in the same career upon her return to the USA in July 2017.

140    I have already set out the parties’ indirect contributions and their roles in this marriage when I discussed the care of the children. It is also not disputed that the husband contributed financially as well to the children and family expenses. I was of the view that the circumstances of the case warrant a higher indirect contribution percentage for the husband although I accept that the wife did play her part in the earlier years of the marriage, between 1999 and 2012. The wife may have done her part in the earlier years of the marriage but having considered the relationship and her conduct from 2011, 2014 and then 2016 onwards, my view is that the husband’s indirect contributions surpassed her especially when one sees how the children have thrived under his charge.

141    This led to the following ratios:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr"><colgroup><col width="47.8295659131826%"> <col width="25.3450690138028%"> <col width="26.8253650730146%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Wife</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Husband</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1. Direct contributions</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">0.15</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">99.8</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2. Indirect contributions</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">40</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">60</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3. Average ratio</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">20.1%</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">79.9%</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

142    After deriving the parties’ overall contributions relative to each other by taking an average of the two ratios above (the derived ratio shall hereinafter be referred to as the “average ratio”), I considered the circumstances of the case and I did not adjust the weightage between the direct and indirect contributions. I had already accorded the husband a higher percentage in terms of his indirect contributions.

143    As for their liabilities, these comprise mainly personal loans for the wife and credit card payments for the husband. As they did not submit on the issues, I did not take these into account.

144    The wife’s entitlement is therefore 20% of $283,760.80 less $429.99 (in her possession) = $56,666.16 rounded off to $56,000. I rounded this off because of interest rates. The husband shall pay to her this sum as her share of the MA within 2 months of the date of this order.

## Costs of the proceedings

145    This family has run the whole gamut of court applications and as I said, traversed 3 different jurisdictions. After a litigation history spanning from 2011 to 2020, I was not minded to award costs of the proceedings to either party. The husband acted in person for a large part of the entire proceedings. The wife had representation for the most part of the proceedings.

146    The divorce was granted on a non-contentious basis. Neither could have been said to have acted unreasonably in the conduct of the ancillary matters hearing warranting a costs order.

147    I therefore made no orders as to costs.
