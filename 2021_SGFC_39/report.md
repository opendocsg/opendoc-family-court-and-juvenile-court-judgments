Ancillary Matters – 11 year marriage with 2 children – maintenance of children – division of matrimonial assets

16 April 2021

### District Judge Geraldine Kang :

## Brief Background

1       For ease of reference, parties shall be referred to Plaintiff / Wife (34 years old) and Defendant / Husband (44 years old) in this written grounds of decision.

2       Briefly, parties were married on 14 April 2008 and 2 daughters (M and T) were borne to them on xx April 2009 and xx July 2011 respectively. Interim Judgement was granted on 19 June 2019, making the marriage approximately 11 years long.

3       The ancillary proceedings were unfortunately acrimonious, in particular the issues concerning their daughters, with several applications and affidavits filed. The Husband was acting in person throughout the proceedings whereas the Wife was represented.

4       It was not disputed that this was a dual income family from the onset of the marriage. In the earlier years of the marriage, the Husband frequently travelled to China to work whilst the Wife remained in Singapore with the children. Subsequently, in 2017 the Husband relocated to China for work and the family joined him from March to December 2017. A domestic helper was hired only after the birth of the second child and the maternal grandmother assisted with childcaring arrangements when the parties were at work.

5       The Wife moved out of the matrimonial home with their 2 daughters sometime in March 2019; whereas the Husband continues to reside there. The Wife rented a condominium in the vicinity of the daughters’ school. Pursuant to mediation, there was an initial arrangement which allowed the Husband to have overnight access from Thursday to Saturday. Unfortunately, the relationship deteriorated exponentially and there were allegations of mental trauma and abuse that M was experiencing and as a consequence had to undergo counselling at school as well as private sessions. M became resistant to seeing the Husband and unsurprisingly, her younger sister also took the cue from her and resisted spending time with the Husband. A series of unfortunate events occurred thereafter – primarily the global pandemic, which made access with the Husband a rather difficult and frustrating experience for all parties. At that point in time, there were no mediated or interim orders recorded by the Court.

6       In the course of hearing the matter and because of the multiple adjournments necessitated largely due to the dispute over the Husband’s eleventh hour sale and disposal of a matrimonial asset (“Catalyst”) (see below). I had made interim orders such as having the Husband pick up the children from their residence and send them to school in the mornings, having virtual access or having access at his brother’s home. But unfortunately, none of these interim orders worked out.

7       At the ancillary hearing before myself, all issues were contested. Having heard parties and the evidence in this matter, a summary of my orders is set out as follows:

> I.     Joint custody of the 2 children of the marriage, with sole care and control to the Wife.

> II.     Husband to have supervised access to the Children at DSSA, comprising 4 face to face sessions and 4 remote sessions. Upon completion of the said supervised access sessions at DSSA, the Husband to have access on Wednesday evening from 8pm to 9pm and on Sundays from 10am to 11am.

> III.      **In respect of the matrimonial flat, the Husband has the first option to notify the Wife of his intention to have the matrimonial flat transferred to him within 14 days of this Order and the Husband to pay the Wife 46.98% of the market value of $420,000 and the transfer is to take place within 6 months. In the alternative, if the Husband does not wish to have the flat transferred to him or if time has lapsed for him to exercise this option, the matrimonial flat shall be sold in the open market within 6 months from the date of this Order. Parties to have joint conduct of the sale. Net proceeds of sale after deducting related expenses of the sale, including agent fees, legal fees, conveyancing fees, agent and outstanding loan, to be divided in the ratio of 53.02% to the Husband and 46.98% to the Wife.**

>> a.        **Upon the sale or transfer of the matrimonial flat, parties are to make the requisite refunds to their respective CPF accounts in accordance with the CPF Act and the subsidiary legislation made thereunder.**

>> b.        **Pending the sale or transfer of the matrimonial flat, the Husband is to bear all related expenses in relation to or arising from the matrimonial flat.**

> IV.      **Each party to retain all other assets held in their sole name.**

> V.     There shall be no maintenance for the Wife.

> VI.      **The Husband shall pay $1000 per month as maintenance for each daughter with effect 1 February 2021 and thereafter the first day of each month into the Wife’s designated account.**

> VII.     The Wife shall be responsible for and shall pay the premiums for all of M’s existing insurance policies (including riders) whilst the Husband is responsible for and shall pay the premiums for all of T’s insurance policies (including riders). Both parties to retain ownership of the policies to the respective child; where the ownership of any of these policies are not with the party, the other party shall sign all necessary documents within 14 days of this order to transfer the policy to the other party.

> VIII.     The Husband shall pay costs fixed at $1000 to the Wife.

8       The Wife is now appealing against my decision only respect of the highlighted orders above. Accordingly, this written grounds of decision shall deal only with these aspects. However, where necessary and appropriate, I will refer to other aspects of the parties’ relationship and conduct that had led me to make the orders I did.

9       For completeness, I would add that the Wife’s Counsel had sought to present further arguments in respect of the orders I made, however I declined to hear those further arguments as these were arguments canvassed over the course of the hearings and well taken into account in my decision. The Wife’s Counsel sought to request for further arguments “_only in respect of the issue on division of matrimonial assets and the failure to backdate the children’s maintenance payable by the Defendant_”. It was a fact that the Wife’s Counsel acknowledged in the very same letter that the Court had “dealt carefully” with the respective financial contributions in making the orders, and thus I saw no reason or basis to grant the request for further arguments, as the Wife was merely dissatisfied with the orders made and not the application of the law to the facts.

## (1)   Division of Matrimonial Assets - The Law

10     The law relating to the power of the court to order division of matrimonial assets is stipulated in Section 112 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353):

> (_1_)     _The court shall have power, when granting or subsequent to the grant of a judgement of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage, to order the division between the parties of any matrimonial asset or the sale of any such asset and the division between the parties of the proceeds of the sale of any such asset in such proportions as the court thinks just and equitable._

> (_2_)     _It shall be the duty of the court in deciding whether to exercise its power under subsection (1) and, if so, in what manner, to have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the following matters:_

>> (_a_)     _the extent of the contributions made by each party in money, property or work towards acquiring, improving or maintaining the matrimonial assets;_

>> (_b_)     _any debt owing or obligation incurred or undertaken by either party for their joint benefit or for the benefit of any child of the marriage;_

>> (_c_)     _the needs of the children (if any);_

>> (_d_)     _the extent of contributions made by each party to the welfare of the family, including looking after the home or caring for the family or any aged or infirm relative or dependant of either party;_

>> (_e_)     _any agreement between the parties with respect to the ownership and division of the matrimonial assets made in contemplation of divorce._

>> (_f_)     _any period of rent-free occupation or other benefit enjoyed by one party in the matrimonial home to the exclusion of the other party;_

>> (_g_)     _the giving of assistance or support by one party to the other party (whether or not of a material kind), including the giving of assistance or support which aids the other party in the carrying on of his or her occupation or business; and_

>> (_h_)     _the matters referred to in section 114(1) so far as they are relevant._

11     The Court of Appeal in **_ANJ v ANK <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span>_** gave guidance in relation to the structured approach for the division of assets under which courts will first ascribe a ratio that represents each party’s direct financial contributions towards the acquisitions of the matrimonial assets, relative to that of the other party. Next, the court will ascribe a second ratio which represents each parties’ indirect contribution to the well-being of the family. If the necessary, the court has a discretion to make further adjustments to this average ratio after taking into account the other factors set out in s 112(2) of the Women’s Charter as well as all relevant circumstances to arrive at a just and equitable division of the matrimonial assets.

## (2)   The Matrimonial Pool and its Division

12     The following summary sets out the main assets which were disputed by parties.

> (a)     Matrimonial flat

> (b)     Catalyst and related company bank accounts

> (c)     Various Personal Bank Accounts

> (d)     Insurance Policies

#### Catalyst xxx Private Limited (“Catalyst”)

13     As much of the contention surrounded Catalyst, it would be useful to set out the background of Catalyst and its eventual sale. Catalyst was primarily in the trade of human resource and payroll consultancy.

14     Catalyst was set up by the Wife sometime in June 2015 at the suggestion of the Husband, who was then in the employment of another company. The Wife was the sole director of the Catalyst until January 2018 when she transferred the company to him, whereby the Husband took over as sole shareholder and director of the company.

15     Whilst the Wife was the sole director of Catalyst, she secured clients for the company and handled the operations of the company on her own. It is an undisputed fact that the Wife is currently an employee of xxx (drawing a monthly net income of approximately $14,409.22) which used to be a client of Catalyst. Her career has progressed from an initial payroll specialist drawing of average income of about $5000 to a consultant (equivalent to a director level in the company). It was the Husband’s contention that the Wife in fact owed her career success to him and/or Catalyst as he had recommended her to the CEO of her current employers where she is currently employed as a consultant.

16     The Wife claimed that during her time at Catalyst, she procured its initial clients; as well as attended to daily operational and administrative matters. Whilst service contracts between Catalyst and the clients were for a certain fee, the Wife claimed that she would draw a lower sum or none at all when Catalyst was short on funds. The Wife was not paid any salaries or director’s fees.

17     According to the Husband, he had left the running of Catalyst to the Wife but she was not on top of accounting matters and thus when he took over the Company from her, the company was not financially viable and he had to rebuild the company and its clients.

18     Catalyst was disposed at a nominal consideration of $1 sometime in March 2020 just prior to the commencement of the ancillary hearing. The Husband claimed that he had received a job offer around the same time in March 2020 and was informed that Catalyst had to be sold off before he commenced his new employment. The Husband failed to disclose the circumstances and background of the sale and that the sale of Catalyst was to a relative of his; the Wife submitted that these were highly suspicious and the timing of the sale at the sale price it was disposed of needed further clarification and accountability; necessitating adjournments.

19     The Wife’s Counsel submitted that the Husband’s dealings with the corporate accounts and monies in the Catalyst were suspicious and tantamount to dissipation of matrimonial assets. The Husband denied vehemently that there was any financial impropriety with regard to the manner in which he dealt with the monies in Catalyst’s corporate accounts; and that in fact Catalyst was not a matrimonial asset even to begin with.

20     Despite the Husband’s insistence otherwise, the legal reality is that Catalyst was a matrimonial asset. As much as he tried to skirt the issue or diminish the Wife’s ability in managing Catalyst, there could be no dispute that it was indeed a matrimonial asset. It was not disputed that it was set up at the behest of the Husband and that it was his initiative that led to its incorporation during their marriage. The fact of the matter was also that the Wife did run it and manage her own clients. Catalyst was incorporated and operated as a result of their joint efforts.

21     After determining that it is a matrimonial asset, the next issue would then be its valuation. The reality was that valuation of such private companies was not a forensic science nor accounting. Neither party had adduced an independent valuation report of the worth of Catalyst and it was understandably so, as the cost of it could have outweighed the actual worth of the asset. In seeking a share of Catalyst as part of the matrimonial pool, the Wife’s simplified argument that for the duration of the time for which she was at the helm of Catalyst, she had procured contracts of a certain value (approximately $170,000) and those were her financial contributions to the company which ought to be taken into account by the Court when determining the matrimonial pool. The Husband on the other hand argued Catalyst was “worthless” as Catalyst were in debts which he had to write off before he sold it.

22     No forensic accounting nor evidence was adduced in this regard of any financial or fiduciary misconduct of the Husband in connect with Catalyst. Even if any was made, I was of the opinion that perhaps an appropriate and separate course of action would be for the Wife would be under a civil suit in the area of company law and corporate governance.

23     Without an independent financial valuation or accounting of Catalyst, the Court was simply not in a position to ascribe a value to it. To do so, would have been entirely speculative on my part. But what I could do was to take judicial notice of the Husband’s conduct in dealing with the eventual disposal of Catalyst which was done at the eleventh hour and suspiciously just before the hearing and have an adverse inference drawn against him.

24     I find that the Father’s credibility with regard to the sale of Catalyst, in particular his account of the sale to a related person was less that credible and the Court noted that it was at a nominal consideration of $1. By his own admission, there was no real basis for this sum of $1 consideration, and it was an arbitrary amount he decided upon. In this regard, as stated, I would not be able to ascribe a value (notional or otherwise to Catalyst) but I could adjust the ratio (under the structured approach in _ANJ v ANK_ – to be elaborated below).

#### The matrimonial flat

25     I noted that this was also the 2nd matrimonial home and financial tracing of their respective contributions would not be possible to an exact science given also the passage of time. This was after all an 11 year marriage, and realistically no married couple will go into a marriage anticipating a divorce such that they would need to keep records and proof of their respective financial expenditure towards their home and household.

26     As at October 2020, the Husband’s direct contributions towards the current matrimonial flat via his CPF monies was a sum of $215,535.16 (including accrued interest) whereas the Wife’s was $50,433.78 (including accrued interests). The outstanding loan was approximately $212,000.

27     I noted that their alleged contributions to financial contributions towards the renovations did not vary too much, accordingly as neither party was able to substantiate it, I regarded it as a neutral point and disregard it when computing their direct financial contributions.

28     A breakdown of their respective contributions towards the matrimonial flat is set out:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="0"><colgroup><col width="39.46%"> <col width="30.84%"> <col width="29.7%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Plaintiff Wife</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Defendant Husband</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Direct Contributions (Monthly mortgage via CPF)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$50,433.78</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>[18.96%]</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$215,535.16</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>[81.04%]</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Direct Payments – Home Renovations</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$30,000</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$40.029</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Indirect Contributions</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">(Non-Financial)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>65%</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>35%</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Average</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">41.98%</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">58.02%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Adjusted</b></p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>46.98%</b></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>53.02%</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

29     To reiterate, this was a marriage of more than 11 years with 2 daughters borne to their union, it was certainly by no means a short marriage. I saw no reason why the structured approach in _ANJ v ANK_ should not be applied. Both parties worked during the marriage and the maternal grandmother helped out wherever the Mother had to work or the Father was outstation in China at the earlier part of their marriage. When the family relocated to China for a short period, I noted that the Mother would have been the primary caregiver whilst the Husband worked.

30     Thus, it was not unreasonable to ascribe the ratios I did and also further adjusted the ratio in favour of 5% to the Wife in view of the Husband’s sale and disposal of Catalyst.

## (3)   Power of court to order maintenance

31     The law relating to the power of the court to order maintenance for children and the assessment of such maintenance is set out in section 69(4) (Cap.353).

32     In determining the amount of maintenance, the court has to have regard to the list of non-exhaustive considerations provided under s 69(4), which reads:

> (4)    The court, when ordering maintenance for a wife or child under this section, shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the following matters:

>> (a)    the financial needs of the wife or child;

>> (b)    the income, earning capacity (if any), property and other financial resources of the wife or child;

>> (c)    any physical or mental disability of the wife or child;

>> (d) the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage;

>> (e) the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family;

>> (f) the standard of living enjoyed by the wife or child before the husband or parent, as the case may be, neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the wife or child;

>> (g) in the case of a child, the manner in which he was being, and in which the parties to the marriage expected him to be, educated or trained; and

>> (h) the conduct of each of the parties to the marriage, if the conduct is such that it would in the opinion of the court be inequitable to disregard it.

## (4)   The Wife’s Case

33     As I understood the Wife’s appeal to be limited specifically to the issue of my decision not to backdate the order of monthly maintenance for the children, and not in relation to quantum so ordered, I saw no need to set out a table detailing the expenses of the children and the assessment of the Court’s assessment of the claim. However, I would pause to add that the lifestyle and standard of living both parents had in mind for their daughters was clearly a bone of serious contention and conflict.

34     The Wife was not appealing against the reasonableness of the quantum the Court had determined but instead was seeking for a shortfall of 23 months calculated on the basis of the deficit between my ordered sum of $2000 per month and the Husband’s voluntary interim contribution of $1250.

35     I now deal with the issue of whether the maintenance for the children should be backdated 1 March 2019 – which was the date the Wife moved out of the matrimonial flat with the 2 daughters. In _Lee Siew Choo v Ling Chin Thor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 185</span>, it was stated at \[15\]:

>     A backdated order for maintenance ensures that the parent in default pays for the child’s needs right from the outset instead of from only the time maintenance is sought. It is a practical and pragmatic tool that, if used judiciously and as the circumstances warrant, can vindicate parental responsibility for a child’s needs.

36     That case also enumerated other a list of considerations that a court should have regard to, in deciding whether to grant an order for backdated maintenance (at \[16\]).

37     At the time of the hearing, there was no great disparity between their respective monthly incomes. The Husband had just found new employment. He informed the Court that he was offered the role of an Assistant HR Director after almost 2 years of seeking employment. Even though the renumeration was less than his previous role as a Group HR Director in 2013, he accepted this job offer. And it was a condition of his acceptance that he had to dispose of Catalyst. At his age, he was at pains to highlight to the Court the challenges he faced given the pandemic as well in terms of attaining a higher paying job befitting of his past experience.

38     The Wife informed the Court that even thought she was diagnosed with cervical cancer, she was not pursuing maintenance for herself. Due credit and recognition is given to her for being financially independent and stoic, but in the present case, I was not persuaded to backdate maintenance. The Husband has provided a voluntary and undisputed monthly sum of $1250 for the maintenance of the 2 daughters. He cannot be said to have been derelict in his parental and financial responsibility to provide for the children.

## (5)   The children’s issues

39     Whilst my orders in respect of the daughters’ custody, care and control, and access orders made were not appealed against, I raise some areas of concern and highlight my observations which were also corroborated by the DSSA reports and hope that parties put their adult differences aside for the sake of their daughters and to move on towards a healthy co-parenting relationship.

40     It was quite clear that the relationship between the Husband and 2 daughters has broken down significantly. The children’s clear lack of trust and unwillingness to spend time with the father is unfortunately a reality which even the Father himself recognises and acknowledges. Accordingly, to insist on overnight access was not feasible in the circumstances and neither was the Husband seeking such an order. The contents of the DSSA report does remain confidential but it would suffice for me to comment that the observations therein were not misaligned with the Father’s own recognition and acceptance of the current situation. Thus, I felt it best for this family to continue receiving counselling and ordered so.

41     The financial issues between the parents had clearly began to trickle down towards the children. The Husband was highly critical of the Wife and her choices, in particular, the rental choice of a condominium (instead of a HDB as he would have preferred for them and he was still staying in one), the daughters pocket money and expenses, dining preferences. Whilst there is of course legitimate parenting styles and values, for the Husband to not only be critical but also punitive towards the Mother and the daughters for their choices, aggravated the rift between them.

## (6)   The Court’s Findings and Decision

42     Accordingly, I made the orders I did and ordered that the Husband pay nominal costs, fixed at $1000 to the Wife, primarily due to his conduct in relation to the sale of Catalyst.
