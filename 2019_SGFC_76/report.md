Family law – interim care and control and access – medical examination of party - Discovery – judge-led

8 July 2019

### District Judge Nicole Loh:

## Introduction

1       The parties in this case are not legally married but are parents of a 4½ year old child. Prior to the commencement of the proceedings in Singapore, the parties were involved in a Hague Convention application in United Kingdom (UK) wherein the Mother and child were ordered to return to Singapore.

## Background of parties

2       The parties were involved in a long term on and off relationship. The Mother is a British and Hungarian citizen who resided and worked in UK until December 2017. Although a British citizen, the Father resided outside of UK for stretches of time and lived in various countries such as Switzerland, Malta and Monaco.

3       After the Child was born, the Father remained primarily resident outside of UK (in Monaco) and had physical access to the child during visits to UK or when the Mother and the Father made arrangements to meet outside of UK for holidays. The Mother was the primary caregiver of the Child.

4       Sometime in 2017, parties agreed to try to live together as a family and Singapore was chosen as their country of residence. To effect this, the Father set up a company in Singapore and the Mother managed to secure a position in the regional office of her bank in Singapore. Both parties also signed a joint Letter of Intention[^1] on 17 December 2017 in which it was agreed that in the event of a breakdown in their relationship after they move to Singapore:-

> a)     The Mother will the primary caregiver and Father will have access;

> b)     Mother will return to the UK and the Father’s access will be arranged with professional advice;

> c)     In the event that habitual residence in Singapore has been established such that the Father’s consent is required for her return to the UK, he will consent to such a return and sign any document required to document his consent.

5       Between January 2018 to September 2018, parties and the child lived in Singapore. However, due to difficulties in the relationship, the Mother, believing she was entitled to pursuant to the joint Letter of Intention, returned to UK with the Child and tried to remain there, thereby sparking the UK Hague Convention proceedings.

6       Upon the return of the Mother and Child to Singapore in early 2019, the current Singapore proceedings were filed by both Father and Mother to seek orders on custody, care and control of the child. The Mother also applied for relocation to UK. The Mother and Child lived separately from the Father upon their return to Singapore.

## Management of proceedings

7       This case was identified to be one that would be beneficial to be docketed and thus was managed and heard by me almost from the beginning. This proved to be useful as parties in this case, tended to file voluminous affidavits (some of which contained repetitive evidence), multiple interim applications (some of which had overlapping issues). Docketing was useful to allow the matter to proceed expeditiously as counsel did not have to repeatedly go into the facts or evidence for each hearing and the Court could identify the relevant issues for determination upfront so that only relevant and necessary evidence need to be adduced by parties.

8       At this point in time, I have dealt with 3 summonses relating to:-

> a)     Interim care arrangements and assessment of Mother’s mental state;

> b)     Application for discovery; and

> c)     Application for interim summer holiday activities.

9       The orders made pursuant to these summonses are:-

> a)     In the interim, pending further orders,

>> i.       The Child shall be re-enrolled into \[nursery school\] with effect from 11 March 2019;

>> ii.       Subject to Orders (v) to (viii), Father shall have the Child during the following times:

>>> 1.       Every Tuesday and Thursday, after school to 7:30pm. Father is to return the Child to the Mother at 7:30pm.

>>> 2.       From 3pm on Fridays to 3pm on Sundays, on alternate weeks. Mother is to pick the child up on Sundays at 3pm.

>> And Mother shall have the Child at all other times.

>> iii.       Father is at liberty to enrol the Child in any activities he deems fit on Tuesdays and Thursdays, when the Child is with him. The Mother is to sign any necessary documents to facilitate this. The Mother is under no obligation to leave the Child in full day childcare during the days the Child is with her.

>> iv.       On Fridays and Saturdays, the parent not with the Child shall have FaceTime calls with the Child at 5:00pm on Fridays and 7:30pm on Saturdays or after Shabbat has ended, whichever is later.

>> v.       Subject to Orders (vi) –(viii), the Child shall be with each parent on alternate Singapore public holidays. If a public holiday falls on a Sunday, it is the Off-in Lieu on Monday that should be alternated and Sunday shall follow Order ii(2) above.

>> vi.       Subject to Orders (vii)-(viii), the Child shall be with each parent during half of the Mid-Term Break, Term Break and Summer Holiday.

>>> 1.       For the summer holidays of 2019, for the first 4 weeks, parties shall have the child on alternate weeks. For the next 4 weeks, parties shall have the child on alternate 2 weeks. For subsequent summer holidays, parties shall have the child on alternate 2 weeks. Summer holidays timing shall start at 10am on the day after the last day of Term 4 and end at 3pm the day before the first day of Term 1 of the following academic year.

>>> 2.       During summer holidays, the party who does not have the child shall have FaceTime with the child at 7:30pm on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays or after Shabbat has ended, whichever is later.

>> vii.       Subject to Order (viii), the Child shall be with each parent as follows during Jewish Holidays:

>>> 1.       Purim, Shavuot, Yom Kippur: from the eve to the actual day on alternate basis. Father is to have the next holiday, i.e. Shavuot.

>>> 2.       Pessach, Rosh Hashana, Sukhot to Simchat Torah, Shmini Atzeret and Chanukah to be divided equally between parties.

>>> 3.       Timing shall be from 3pm of the eve to 7:30pm of the actual day.

>>> 4.       The Child is to continue attending school except for the Jewish holidays which are yom tov.

>> viii.       The Child shall be with the Father on Father’s Day and the Father’s birthday and with the Mother on Mother’s Day and the Mother’s birthday unless the Child is with a parent for Rosh Hashana, Yom Kippur and Pessach pursuant to Order (vii).

>> ix.       For Singapore public holidays, parties’ birthdays (if it falls on a non-school day), Mother’s and Father’s Day, Child shall be handed over (if applicable) to the other parent at 10am and returned at 7:30pm. If the parties’ birthday falls on a school day, that party will pick the child up after school and return (if applicable) to the other parent at 7:30pm.

>> x.       If a parent is travelling overseas during his/her time with the Child, the Child shall be with the remaining parent in Singapore.

>> xi.       Parties are at liberty to bring the Child to their own choice of synagogue for worship. The Child shall attend Sunday School at xxx Synagogue as it is only available there. The parent having the Child that day shall fetch the Child for Sunday School.

> e)     Mother shall facilitate the continuation of the Child’s music lesson with Ms M at xxx Academy once a week during her time with the Child during the summer holidays for the year 2019.

10     I have also given directions for final affidavits to be filed by each party and fixed the main applications for hearing. I had also directed that a remaining summons be dealt with together with the main applications which will resolve the issues of custody, care and control as well as relocation.

## Father’s appeal

11     The Father has appealed against the orders set out in paragraph 9(a)(ii), 9(a)(v), 9(a)(viii), 9(a)(ix), 9(b) and 9(c).

12     He also appealed against the directions given in paragraph 10 above.

## Mother’s appeal

13     The Mother has appealed against the order set out in paragraph 9(a)(vii) and the order of precedence in the various orders on timing with the Child.

## Grounds of Decision

14     Although the orders made in paragraph 9 above were made on different dates and separate appeals were filed, I consolidate my reasons for the orders made for all the appeals in one Ground of Decision so that all the pending appeals can be dealt with together.

##### Weekly timings

15     The Father had applied for interim shared care and control of the Child on an alternate week basis. He submited that it was in the interest of the Child to restore the status quo prior to the Mother taking the child to UK. He points to the fact that the Child lived together with both parents from January 2018 to September 2018 and he was actively involved in the care of the Child. Therefore, there should be shared care and control or he at least has equal time with the Child as the Mother.

16     The Mother objected to this and claimed to be the primary caregiver of the Child. She made this submission based on her care of the Child since birth to date, the joint letter of intention signed by both parties, the multiple periods even between January to September 2018 that the Father was overseas and not with the Child.

17     After hearing parties, it was undisputed that for the majority of the Child’s life (since birth) until December 2017, the Mother was the primary caregiver of the Child. The Father lived in a different country from the Child during this period.

18     I accept that during the period from January 2018 to September 2018, the Father had more chance to bond and care for the Child. I also accept the argument that where possible, the status quo for children should be maintained. However, I did not agree that interim shared care and control on an alternate week basis or equal timing is in the best interest of _this child_. Firstly, the submission was primarily based on the fact that parties lived together with the Child before the Mother took the Child to UK. That was the status quo of the Child. The Father premised his application on the basis that shared care and control is the closest arrangement to the status quo prior to the Child’s departure to the UK.

19     The shared care and control entails the Child having to transition from one home to another home repeatedly. A high level of co-operation and joint parenting will be required from both parents to have a seamless transition that will not confuse and unsettle the Child. I do not see that as likely to be achieved instantaneously in the parties before me. As can be seen from the interim orders that were made, parties were not able to agree on many issues relating to the Child. Where parents are unable to co-operate at a high functioning level, it will not be in the interest of the Child to be placed in a shared care and control arrangement, which only gives parties more arena to disagree on, thereby putting the Child’s life at a standstill. The primary consideration is the child’s best interest. Status quo can be one factor in determining this. However, it is not the only nor deciding factor otherwise it would ordinarily mean shared care and control is a default order whenever parents, who used to live together with a child, separate.

20     Furthermore, this was an application to put in place arrangements on an interim basis pending the final determination of the main applications. I saw no need to determine which party would have care and control on an interim basis. Much of the arguments seemed more suited to the final hearing for care and control orders.

21     There was already a previous arrangement between parties following the UK proceedings for the Father’s access time with the Child. He had weekend access with the Child on alternate weeks from 3pm on Fridays to 3pm on Sundays. I therefore made orders that gave the Father more opportunity on a weekly basis to bond with the child in the interim until final orders will be made.

22     In determining the days of the week which the Child can spend with the Father, I took into consideration the fact he wished to re-enrol the Child into activities. Therefore I ordered the Child to be with the Father during days where the Father will be able to enrol the Child into the activities. These were Tuesdays and Thursdays for taekwondo and basketball. Therefore, I ordered the Father to have the Child after school on Tuesdays and Thursdays. He should have sufficient time to have dinner with the Child and return the Child at a time which allows the Child sufficient time to settle down for bedtime. I therefore ordered return at 7:30pm.

23     There was a disagreement between parties whether the Mother should pick the Child up or the Father ought to return the Child. Either way, the timings ought to be respected by both parties and I did not see any huge obstacle faced by either party with regard to handover or pick up. Since the Father complained the Mother had tried to pick the Child up earlier, I ordered him to return the Child so that he is in control of the return.

##### Singapore Public Holidays, Father’s Birthday, Father’s Day, Mother’s Birthday, Mother’s Day

24     Father sought division of the Singapore public holidays on an alternate basis. Father also wanted each parent to have the child during their respective birthdays and Mother’s/Father’s Day. Mother did not have much issue with these.

25     In terms of timing, the Father sought that it commences after school (if the eve falls on a school day) or 3pm (if not a school day) on the eve of the public holiday/birthday/Mother’s Day/Father’s Day and ending at 6pm on the actual public holiday/birthday/Mother’s Day/Father’s Day.

26     I did not see any particular reason why if the Father’s birthday is on xxx June, the Child starts changing his routine and schedules the day before. Similarly, Father’s Day falls on a Sunday in June and that will already potentially change the routine for weekly weekend access. Is there a need that because Father’s Day is on Sunday, Saturday needs to be affected as well? This of course applies equally to the Mother’s Day. Mother’s Day is a Sunday in May. Does it mean she has to take Child away from the Father on Saturday if it is his weekend with the Child? I see no need to overly complicate access by making so many exceptional timing arrangements that fall outside of the normal weekly timings. This was proven to be a valid concern as I was referred to an extensive and colourful calendar for the years 2019 to 2020 prepared by the Father to show how the various different types of timing (weekly, Singapore public holidays, special events, school holidays, Jewish holidays) all interacted with each other.

27     I did foresee a potential conflict (shown in the extensive calendar) between parties if there was a public holiday which falls on a Sunday for which the following Monday is a public holiday in lieu. I decided not to allow this to become an issue and ordered that the Sunday itself will follow the weekly schedule and it is the Monday public holiday in lieu that should follow the alternate public holiday schedule.

##### Jewish Holidays

28     As both parents were of the Jewish faith, the Father asked for division of the Jewish Holidays between the 2 parents. From his suggestion, he was in essence, asking the Court to divide the Holidays equally between the parties.

29     The Mother did not provide a clear position on the division of the Jewish Holidays and much of her arguments centred on whether the Father was a true devout Jew who celebrated the festivities.

30     I did not consider it relevant to determine and judge the level of religious devotion that parties had vis-à-vis each other. It was not denied that these Jewish Holidays existed. There was no reason not to divide it equally between the parties. In the same manner, all Singaporean parents will divide Christmas, Deepavali, Good Friday, Hari Raya Puasa and Hari Raya Haji regardless of whether they were Christians, Hindus or Muslims.

31     For Jewish holidays which spanned more than 1 day, i.e. Pessach, Sukhot, Rosh Hashana, I ordered them to be equally shared between the parties. For other Jewish holidays, which were for a day, I ordered it to be shared on an alternate basis.

32     It was only at the clarification of orders, the Mother made submissions to state that orders should only be made for Pessac, Shavuot, Rosh Hashana, Yom Kippur, Sukhkot and Shemini Atzaret to Simchat Torah. She also now states that only the days which are yom tov (i.e days in which normal work is forbidden which would mean the child should not go to school) ought to be divided. As the child is in a non-jewish school, there are ongoing school curriculum during the Jewish holidays. She also sought orders for the Child to continue attending school save for one day of each of the main Jewish holidays of Rosh Hashana, Yom Kippur, Pessach.

33     First of all, I considered the Mother’s submission at the clarification hearing to be a bit late in the day. I had heard arguments on the division of the Jewish Holidays and she did not address or make all these arguments about dividing only yom tov Jewish Holidays. None of the evidence about what holidays are major, which days are yom tov, which days need not be divided were in evidence. Although the Mother said that the Father’s affidavit did not address this issue of Jewish Holidays and therefore she did not have anything to respond to, this issue was clearly applied for in the Father’s summons. The application was part heard with written submissions filed. I would have expected the Mother to address the Father’s submissions at the very least.

34     I did not restrict access to those Jewish Holidays that the Mother claimed were more important. There was no clear evidence before me on why certain holidays were less important. Even if not a yom tov holiday (i.e. normal work continues), this does not prevent special arrangements being made for them outside of normal access schedule. For example the Court does make orders on dividing Easter Sunday for Christians and Chinese New Year eve for Chinese although they are not public holidays. Parties just plan their special activities around existing work/school requirements.

35     The Mother did at the Clarification Hearing, provide a calendar to support her position that only specific Jewish Holidays were yom tov. Even considering her calendar, she was not following the exact requirement of yom tov in her request as to when the child should be attending school. I accepted her submission that only certain days are yom tov, where normal work is forbidden. I therefore clarified that the Child should continue to go to school except for Jewish Holidays which are yom tov. As to the disruption to the Child’s school curriculum, the Child was currently in childcare and I did not think there was any serious impact as he was not in formal education as yet. In fact, as can be seen from the order set out in 9(a)(iii), the Mother was resisting putting the Child in full time childcare whilst the Father was keen on this which resulted in a need for an order to resolve this.

36     Based on her calendar, I also made further adjustments to include Jewish Holidays which were not originally included in my order as per my basis of division in paragraph 31 above.

##### Precedence of access outside of weekly timing

37     The precedence of access over weekly timing between parties was initially ordered to be:

> a)     Jewish Holidays

> b)     Father’s Day, Father’s birthday, Mother’s Day and Mother’s birthday

> c)     Singapore public holidays

> d)     School holidays

38     At the clarification hearing, both parties agreed that only the 3 major Jewish holidays of Rosh Hashana, Yom Kippiur and Pessach are to have first priority. The other remaining Jewish Holidays can have a lower priority.

39     Their respective positions were then:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="50.18%"> <col width="49.82%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Father</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Mother</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Rosh Hashana, Yom Kippur, Pessach</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Rosh Hashana, Yom Kippur, Pesach and parties’ birthdays</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Parties’ birthdays, Mother’s Day and Father’s Day</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Father’s Day, Mother’s Day and remaining Jewish Holidays</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">School holiday</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Remaining Jewish holidays</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">School holiday</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Singapore public holidays</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Singapore public holidays</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

40     I placed the major Jewish Holidays above the parties’ birthdays as I noted there is a possibility of a clash in dates (due to the Jewish Holidays following their own calendar). In the same manner, I could not put the remaining Jewish Holidays to be at the same priority as Mother’s Day and Father’s Day as suggested by the Mother as they could clash. Therefore, the only issue I had to decide was whether the remaining Jewish holidays came before or after school holidays. I decided that they should be ranked above the school holidays which is the norm if there is a public holiday e.g. Hari Raya, that falls during the June Holiday. That normally takes precedence over the school holiday access.

##### Father’s application for Discovery

#### (A)   Employment documents

41     The Father applied for discovery of the Mother’s employment letters, correspondence, memos, records and documents with xxx Bank from July 2018 to date which shows:

> a)     Why the Mother’s role in the Bank became purportedly unsustainable as alleged by her;

> b)     The alleged “discomfort” that arose between the Mother and the Bank’s Asia head of sales;

> c)     Correspondence and any employment of her purported offer to be employed in the Bank, London, in October 2018 and her purported rejection of this offer; and

> d)     Correspondence relating to her current term of employment in relation to her “no pay leave” until May 2019.

42     To understand the context of this application, it must be set out that the Mother had made the following allegations in the main application:

> a)     She had a very senior role in xxx Bank in London originally.

> b)     When she moved to Singapore, xxx Bank had created a junior role in Singapore for her.

> c)     In August 2018, she spoke to her employers and made arrangements to transfer back to London office. She subsequently declined it. (This was a statement made in the Hague proceedings)

> d)     After she returned to London with the Child on 27 September 2018, her boss, the Managing Director of the Bank told her that her created role in Singapore was not sustainable. The Mother also states her presence in Singapore (as a senior employee with a more junior role) caused discomfort with the Asia head of sales.

> e)     xxx Bank made her a formal job offer for a role in London about a month later.

> f)     She has accepted the job in London on 27 November 2018. Her new employment contract has been exhibited[^2].

> g)     The Mother has produced a letter dated 7 December 2018 from the Managing Director confirms she is no longer employed by xxx Bank in the Singapore branch and there is no job open to her there because there is no requirement for her role and that she has a job with xxx Bank in London.

> h)     She no longer has a job in Singapore but is unable to start in her new job in London either and is on unpaid leave until May 2019.

> i)     She has produced a letter dated 7 February 2019 confirming that the bank will accommodate her request to take unpaid leave until 1 May 2019[^3].

43     The Father sought discovery as he wishes to show the Mother engineered her loss of job in Singapore. He based his suspicions on the fact that her original description was that she arranged to transfer back to London \[see paragraph 42(c) above.\] This subsequently changed to an allegation that her role in Singapore was not sustainable \[see paragraph 42(d)\]. He also claimed the Mother was stated to be already working in London as early as October 2018 on the bank’s website (However, the screenshot of the website actually shows the Mother to be working in Singapore contrary to his claim).

44     The Mother submitted that there was nothing suspicious about her loss of employment in Singapore and subsequent employment in London. She asserts there was no confusion or contradiction as she was describing a series of events. The documents already provided by her speak for themselves. There is no basis for the Father to suspect that an international bank would be colluding with the Mother to engineer a loss in job in Singapore and employ her in London to assist her in the relocation application.

45     Being the judge who would hear the relocation application, I had the benefit of already seeing the evidence that was before me. Discovery should only be ordered when it is relevant and necessary to assist the judge to determine an issue.

46     Whilst the Mother’s job status is a relevant factor, it is not the overarching factor. Ultimately for the relocation application, I would have to consider the Child’s best interest. I am not of the view that each party’s submission on this factor would play a big part in my decision. This is because _even if_ the Mother had engineered the loss of job in Singapore and somehow transferred her job to London, the reality is she does not have that job in Singapore anymore. In any event, the Mother in this case has had extensive work experience in the course of her career. Even if she does not have her original job in Singapore, I am unlikely to find that she cannot find any job in Singapore, thereby necessitating relocation.

47     Therefore, I do not deem it necessary to order the discovery sought by the Father as my ultimate decision on care and control and relocation will not turn on whether the Mother lost her job in Singapore through normal redundancy or through her engineering.

#### (B)   Advice and communication with the Mother’s legal advisors

48     The Father sought discovery of all advice and communication that the Mother had with her legal advisors, at all times, in particular but not only her English solicitors. This had a very wide ambit.

49     He made this application on the basis that she had explained in her affidavit that she had been advised she had a good chance that UK court will find the Child to be habitually resident in London and she was advised that based on the Joint Letter of Intention, the Father had consented to her returning to UK with the Child. And because she had referred to her legal advice, she had waived legal professional privilege. The Father submitted that the advice is relevant to the Mother’s contention that parties had moved to Singapore on a “trial basis”.

50     The Mother objected to the discovery and denies any waiver of privilege. She also points out that this is not relevant to the current proceedings.

51     Legal advice is protected by privilege and is not open to discovery unless there is an express waiver. I do not find that the Mother has waived her privilege with regard to all advice she received from her English solicitors in this case from her explanation of why she believed she could remain in UK with the Child. The ambit of discovery also extends far beyond what she referred to in her affidavit by applying for her legal advice from all her legal advisors at all times.

52     Whether the child was wrongly retained or legitimately retained by the Mother in UK was relevant in the Hague Proceedings but not for the proceedings before me. As to the Mother’s contention that parties had moved to Singapore on a trial basis, it was based on her factual assertions of what had happened between parties. I also do not find the legal advice that she did or did not receive relevant to me for the purposes of determining best interest of the child. I therefore dismissed this application.

#### (C)   Treatment notes, diagnosis, prescription, recommendations from various therapists, doctors, psychologist, un-redacted copy of Dr MM’s report and Father’s application for Mother to be examined by a clinical psychiatrist.

53     The Father alleged that the Mother could be suffering from an unidentified medical condition that would affect her care of the Child and therefore applied for discovery of documents from all the medical professionals she had consulted. Further to this, he also applied for her to be medically examined to ascertain what medical condition she suffers from, if any.

54     The Father based his allegation that the Mother does suffer from some sort of medical condition that affects her care of the child on the statements and submissions made by her during the Hague Proceedings. He pointed to the Hague proceedings judgement where the Mother had submitted that she suffered from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and the effect of her returning to Singapore will be intolerable, which will in due course place an intolerable burden on their child[^4]. He therefore submits that the Mother has declared herself to be suffering from a mental condition which will affect her ability to care for the child and she cannot now deny it in the current proceedings. The mental condition which she suffers is relevant for the purposes of the main application, thereby necessitating full discovery of all her treatment and diagnosis with the various healthcare professionals that she had been seeing and an order for her to be medically examined. To support his application, he filed an affidavit from a Dr L, a consultant psychiatrist.

55     The Mother objected to this and explained that she was running a defence against an order for return to Singapore in the Hague proceedings, which is different from the current proceedings. Conversely, the Father was denying that she had such a medical condition in the Hague proceedings. He cannot deny it in UK and then come to Singapore to agree the Mother does suffer from such medical condition. The Mother also has been caring for the Child since birth without any actual issues being raised by the Father and in fact, he has praised her for being a very good mother. He has no real evidence that she has any medical condition and is therefore fishing to form a case.

56     It is the Father’s reply submission that he had no issues with the Mother’s care of the Child previously because he had no inkling that she suffered from any mental condition. He only realised that that the Mother has a mental condition when she claimed so in the Hague proceedings. He claims he did not deny that she had a medical condition in the Hague proceedings but only submitted it was not relevant in the Hague Proceedings.

57     Both parents’ medical condition are of course relevant to any application relating to care of a child. However, the Court does not order parents to be medically examined as a matter of course for all proceedings relating to the care of a child. There must be some basis for concern regarding the mental state of a parent. In this case, it is clear from the Father’s submission that he did not see any impact on the Child’s care by the Mother due to any alleged mental condition. His only basis to allege the Mother has any medical condition is due to what was claimed and produced by her in the Hague Proceedings. Contrary to his submission before me, after examining the transcripts of the Hague Proceedings and also paragraphs 23 to 25 of his affidavit filed on 9 April 2019, the Father did allege that all the reports provided by the Mother were self-serving and tailor-made for litigation. He explained that the referrals he was seeking discovery of are important to show her consultations were for the purpose of litigation. In other words, he must mean she did not have any real medical condition and if so, why would I need to order discovery of all these medical documents?

58     Nonetheless, I turned to examine what the Mother stated in the Hague Proceedings. The Mother was raising a defence against an order for return to Singapore after the UK Court had found the Child to be habitually resident in Singapore. She claimed that she suffered PTSD from the verbal and physical abuse from the Father and therefore should not be ordered to be returned to Singapore.

59     I examined the reports that were already produced by the Mother in her affidavits (these were also produced in the Hague Proceedings) to see what was the evidence produced in relation to the Mother’s medical condition. The reports and relevant information are:

60     From the various documents, it is clear the Mother had been seeing various medical professionals due to her relationship problems with the Father. It is clear that the Mother was suffering from mental distress due to her relationship with the Father in the past. These showed her reaction to situational stresses she is facing, especially during the Hague proceedings where she appeared to be highly distressed over the prospect of returning to Singapore with the Child. I see no basis to suggest she has an underlying long-term medical disorder that would affect her ability to care for the child. None of the medical documents also show that. There are no allegations that she was unable to function socially, in her work and in her care of the Child.

61     I note the affidavit from Dr L (who made his opinion based on reading the affidavits of parties), states:-

> a)     that there were various diagnosis from different people;

> b)     PTSD is different from Adjustment Disorder with Anxious and Depressed mood, contributed by marital stress;

> c)     However, medication prescribed to her are not specific to PTSD;

> d)     The dosage of medication prescribed by Dr KS was below the usual dosage for treatment of depression;

> e)     The dosage prescribed by Dr KS was increased subsequently; and

> f)     He is unable to tell the reasons for Dr KS’s prescription.

> With reference to para 61(c), that was a misleading statement as the medication he referred to was prescribed by Dr KS who did not diagnose the Mother with PTSD and naturally his medication would not be for treating PTSD. With respect, I find Dr L’s affidavit of little probative value as he is essentially reading another doctor’s prescription and diagnosis of a patient after their consultation and stating he does not know why that doctor came up with a particular diagnosis or prescription. This would be obvious since he never examined the patient personally at that time or at any time.

62     I did not admit a Dr N’s (a psychologist) affidavit into evidence. This affidavit was filed by the Father after I had completed hearing the application for the Mother to be medically examined but prior to the delivery of my decision as I waited to finish hearing the arguments for the discovery of the medical documents. I had already indicated clearly to counsel that I was not having further submissions relating to the medical examination application but this affidavit was filed without my leave. In addition, I find this affidavit to be of little probative value as it is an opinion of a doctor on the Mother based on the affidavits that were given to him. The Father had already filed Dr L’s affidavit which gave opinion on the Mother’s condition based on the documents before the Court. Neither doctor had examined her personally.

63     As earlier stated, the Court does not order medical examination as a matter of course. There is sufficient information in the existing medical reports before me to show that what the Mother was claiming in the UK court was that she was suffering from was stress-related anxiety (to use a more layman term) in various degree arising from her relationship and litigation. I did not find it critical for me to ascertain the clinical diagnosis of whether it is PTSD, depression or Adjustment Disorder. Her symptoms were described sufficiently in the various documents.

64     The UK Court also accepted it is upsetting and distressing for the Mother to return to Singapore and the stress on this particular mother was acute. However protective measures could be put in place to alleviate the Mother’s distress[^11]. Even in the 8 November 2018 document from Ms J, it was reported the Mother felt some measure of relief in London. Currently parties do not live together in Singapore. I would accept that the present ongoing litigation would still cause some level of anxiety to parties. But this would be situational anxiety. I do not intend to judge either parent’s ability to care for the child based on the anxiety that they are experiencing due to litigation.

65     I therefore declined to appoint a psychiatrist to examine the Mother. I also did not require the further documents that the Father applied for from the various medical professionals. Medication prescribed by the medical professionals to treat the symptoms of distress presented by the Mother at that time, will not be useful to me. It was also not necessary for me to have evidence on who had referred Mother to which medical professional.

66     The Father had applied for an un-redacted copy of Dr MM’s medical report which had been produced by the Mother. Although the report had a blank portion under Diagnosis and was unsigned, Dr MM has confirmed in an email that this is his full report and gave reasons why there was a blank portion. I accept there is no other un-redacted copy of his report and did not order discovery of this document.

##### Further directions given for the final hearing

67     After dealing with the interlocutory applications above, I gave directions for the final hearing and fixed the case for final hearing on suitable dates catering to the availability of all counsel.

68     Pursuant to my powers in rule 22 of the Family Justice Rules,

> a)     I ordered each party to file only one additional affidavit each. At this moment, the Father has already filed a total of 10 affidavits and the Mother has filed 8 affidavits. Most of the affidavits already filed are hundreds of pages thick. With so much evidence already in Court, there is already more than sufficient evidence for the final hearing. However, I did allow each party to put in one more affidavit in reply to each other’s affidavits which have not been replied to as yet. Seeing they are reply affidavits, I directed that no new allegations should be raised.

> b)     I also ordered that no further affidavits from third parties should be filed. This is because the Father has filed the following affidavits from third parties:

>> i.       Dr L to support his application for medical examination (see paragraph 61 above);

>> ii.       Affidavit from an art therapist who gave a professional opinion based on looking at the Child’s artwork, school reports and affidavits that the Child should be engaged in activities (in support of the Father’s application for specific activities to be fixed for the Child throughout the summer holidays regardless of which parent having the Child), that the child should return to full day school especially since his parents are having relationship difficulties, it is unhealthy for the Child to “remain cooped up at home in Sentosa”; and

>> iii.       Dr N (see paragraph 62 above). I had disallowed this to be admitted for the medical examination application. I also clarified that this affidavit would be caught by my new direction that no further affidavit from third parties to be allowed. Dr N’s affidavit gave his opinion on whether \[Mother\] has psychological issues arising from her fertility treatment or issues. He further gives an opinion on the Mother’s personality (that she is very resentful and angry), her ability to be an effective and caring parent, her perception of the Father on the basis of the litigation between parties and the “unlawful retention” in London. I had grave concerns regarding the opinions of Dr N which seemed rather extreme and wide-ranging given the fact he had not interviewed the parties involved.

>> For the main care and control applications, I was of the view that the relevant direct evidence I needed should be from the Father and Mother themselves. I also had within their affidavits, statements from some friends, the Child’s previous nanny, the Chief Rabbi, the various medical health professionals, the Child’s school and documents relating to the Hague proceedings. I considered there to be sufficient evidence from the more relevant third parties that have direct contact with the Child, i.e. his previous nanny and his teachers.

>> I did not need more experts from various fields giving their opinions from reading the affidavits that were before me.

> c)     Lastly, I directed that SUM 1805/2019 which largely relates to an application:-

>> i.       For the full day enrolment of the Child in kindergarten;

>> ii.       Restraining both parties from removing the Child from school during kindergarten 1 school term;

>> iii.       For discovery of the child’s medical treatment since 2019 and medical insurance for the purpose of assisting the Father to make better joint decisions on the medical care of the Child and to assess the Mother’s employability; and

>> iv.       That Mother be ordered to apply for a Long Term Visit Pass;

>> v.       That Father be granted leave to apply for Singapore permanent residency with the Child be fixed together with the final hearing for custody, care and control and relocation since these can and should be dealt with together.

> d)     The remaining directions on timelines for affidavits, submissions were given after agreement from all counsel.
