Family Law – Personal Protection Order – section 65 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353)

16 June 2020

### District Judge Cheryl Koh:

## A.    Introduction

1       SS No. 2185 of 2019 is an application by the complainant son (the “**Son**”) against the respondent father (the “**Father**”) for a personal protection order (“**PPO**”), filed pursuant to section 65 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353).

2       On 3 March 2020, I allowed the Son’s application. The Father has appealed.

3       Essentially, I found that the Father has caused continuous harassment against the Son by repeatedly and persistently following the Son, approaching and confronting him, loitering outside his national service camp and residence, lying in wait for him, monitoring his movements, insulting and threatening him, having a physical altercation with him, approaching and confronting his girlfriend (the “**Girlfriend**”), approaching and confronting the Girlfriend’s parents, and filming them on video. These acts of harassment took place repetitively over a continuous period of time between December 2018 to September 2019. This is despite the Father knowing, or he ought to have known, that these acts would cause mental, emotional and psychological anguish to the Son, and in my view, a PPO against the Father is necessary for the Son’s protection.

## B.    Background facts

4       The Father is 57 years old, and the Son is 24 years old. In November 2018, parties had a dispute over the Son collecting a deposit from his sister to use his laptop. The Father messaged the Son “_If you have the guts, don’t come home_”, called him an “_unfilial son_” and used a four letter vulgarity word on him[^1]. On or around 8 November 2018, the Son moved out of the Father’s residence. The Son is currently residing with his girlfriend (the “**Girlfriend**”) and her parents, at their residence (the “**Girlfriend’s residence**”).

5       The Son alleged there were about seven (7) incidents of harassment engaged by the Father against him, a brief summary of which is as follows:

> (a)     on 31 December 2018, at the Girlfriend’s workplace by creating a scene when he approached and confronted the Girlfriend, shouted at her and took photos, resulting in the Girlfriend having to consider an early termination of her contract;

> (b)     on 3 February 2019, at the Son’s national service camp by approaching and confronting the Son, following him, shouting at him and attempting to get into his private hire car with him, resulting in the police being called to stop the Father from following him;

> (c)     on 7 April 2019, at the Son’s national service camp where the Father and his wife (also the Son’s mother, the “**Mother**”) followed him and called him names, filmed him with their mobile phones and threatened to beat up the Girlfriend’s parents. The Father and Mother also managed to obtain the address of the Girlfriend’s residence and went and loitered at the void deck;

> (d)     on 23 June 2019, by loitering at the staircase outside the Girlfriend’s residence and together with the Mother, confronting the Girlfriend at the bus stop, eventually leading to a physical altercation between the Father and the Son and the police being called;

> (e)     on 17 August 2019 at around 7.15AM, by loitering at the staircase outside the Girlfriend’s residence with the Mother and later, by taking videos or photos of the Son from a traffic junction, resulting in the police being called;

> (f)     on 31 August 2019 at about 9.00AM, by loitering at the staircase outside the Girlfriend’s residence and splashing a liquid at the door before leaving, resulting in the police being called; and

> (g)     on 8 September 2019 at 9.00AM, by loitering outside the Son’s residence with the Mother, calling the Son names and blocking the Girlfriend’s parents’ way, resulting in the police being called.

6       The Father admitted to visiting the Son and/or the Girlfriend on all these incidents, but argued he only did so because he wanted to see the Son or ask him to go home. Additionally, he raised two incidents in his Statement. The first was on 16 January 219 where he went to look for the Son at his national service camp. The second was on 20 April 2019 where the Father and the Mother met with the Girlfriend’s parents. This meant that other than the seven (7) incidents of harassment relied upon by the Son in his Statement, there were at least two (2) additional incidents admitted by the Father where he had attempted to contact the Son or the persons the Son is living with.

7       The Son submitted documents tendered and marked as “**C1, pages 1 to 22**” and his complaint form is marked as “**C2**”. The Father submitted documents tendered and marked as “**R1, pages 1 to 16**”. The Son had one witness, who was the Girlfriend. The Father also had one witness, the Mother, whose affidavit is marked as “**R2**”. The Father also admitted three video recordings with transcriptions and translations marked as “**R3**”. The hearing took place over two half days on 11 February 2020 and 3 March 2020.

## C.    Grounds of Decision

### The law

8       Section 65(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353) states as follows:

> _“65.—(1_)     _The court may, upon satisfaction on a balance of probabilities that family violence has been committed or is likely to be committed against a family member and that it is necessary for the protection of the family member, make a protection order restraining the person against whom the order is made from using family violence against the family member.”_

9       “Family violence” is defined in section 64 of the Women’s Charter to mean the commission of any of the following acts:

> (a)     wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;

> (b)     causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;

> (c)     wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his will; or

> (d)     causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member,

> but does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age.

10     It is trite that there are two limbs to be satisfied for the grant of a PPO: _first_, that an act of violence has been committed in the past or that there is a likelihood of its occurrence in the future and _second_, it is necessary for the protection of the family member that an order be made: _AMT v AMV_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGDC 14</span> at \[18\].

11     In _Yue Tock Him v Yee Ee Lim_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGDC 99</span>, the term “_harassment_” is defined at \[33\] to mean “_a course of conduct by a person, whether by_ **_words or action_**_, directly or_ **_through third parties_**, **_sufficiently repetitive_** _in nature as would cause, and which he_ **_ought reasonably to know would cause, worry, emotional distress or annoyance_** _to another person.”_ (emphasis added)

12     The issues thus arise as to whether the above incidents raised by the Son constitute continual harassment caused by the Father against the Son, with an intent to cause or knowing they would likely cause anguish to the Son, and a PPO is necessary for the Son’s protection.

### The present case

13     In my judgment, the Son has proven on a balance of probabilities that the Father has continually harassed him despite knowing that it would cause him anguish, and a PPO is necessary for his protection.

##### Acts amounting to continual harassment

#### 31 December 2018

14     For the incident on 31 December 2018, the Girlfriend testified that the Father had come to her workplace to look for her. Whilst videoing her, the Father asked her to persuade the Son to return home, but she informed him that it was not something she could control. He then began shouting. He was asked to leave by a human resource personnel, one “Angela”, but he came back into the premises a second time and had to be escorted out by a “big-sized” staff[^2].

15     The Father admitted he had visited the Girlfriend’s workplace to ascertain the Son’s whereabouts[^3], but denied he was shouting or taking photos[^4].

16     I preferred the Girlfriend’s testimony to the Father’s. Her testimony is consistent with the Son’s message exchange with Angela, who messaged the Son stating “_\[the Father\] was shouting away here_” and _“\[you\] (sic) will have to give him \[a\] (sic) call and tell him not to come_” (words in square brackets replaced)[^5]. The Son responded that once the Girlfriend completed her contract, “Angela” should let the Father know that the Girlfriend no longer worked there if he showed up again. “Angela” replied she had asked the Girlfriend to discuss terminating her contract earlier. This meant that the Father’s words and behaviour at the Girlfriend’s workplace would have been of such extremity or disruptiveness, so as to cause “Angela” to contact the Son directly, and for the Girlfriend to consider terminating her contract. This would have been to avoid the Father causing further issues at the Girlfriend’s workplace. This is notwithstanding that the Girlfriend eventually completed her contract after further discussions.

17     The Father also admitted that during the incident on 31 December 2018, he was feeling “_upset_[^6]”, which supports the Girlfriend’s testimony that the Father was behaving in a “_worked up_” and “a_gitated_” manner[^7]. As for the Father’s denial that he had taken photographs on his phone, the Father admitted he did take out his phone, but it was to contact the Mother[^8]. However, it is borne in mind that the Father is someone who appeared to readily record incidents on his phone, as evidenced by his production of video recordings of the incidents on 16 January, 7 April and 23 June 2019.

18     It is further observed that the Father had confronted the Girlfriend at her workplace and not the Son. This incident would nonetheless have caused the Son distress in that the Father had approached the Girlfriend at her workplace and created a scene, such that the human resource officer had to contact the Son directly to intervene. In any event, for conduct to constitute harassment, it need not be made _directly_ against the victim but also _indirectly_ by harassing the victim’s closed ones, as in this case, the Son’s girlfriend.

#### 16 January 2019

19     The Father admitted that on 16 January 2019, he went to the Son’s national service camp to speak to the Son. He produced a video recording of the Son’s commander speaking to the Son, while he filmed from afar[^9]. He also took down the contact number of the Son’s commander to keep in touch for any updates on the Son[^10].

20     The Son did not rely on this incident in his Statement, but he raised two other incidents of the Father visiting his camp on 3 February and 7 April 2019. It is clear from the Son’s testimony that these visits by the Father to the Son’s national service camp where the Father contacted the Son’s supervisors and commanders, and aired dirty laundry about the Son’s behaviour, caused the Son much embarrassment and distress:

> _“during the point when I was in National Service, he came to my camp and at that point, of course, I had supervisors, commanders…. they would all be wondering what happened? Why--- why---why is your parents coming in to look for you? Why haven’t you went home? And, of course, I---I told them the truth, everything. I told them about it, they understand why. At first, they, uh---at first, they do not because, of course, it’s dirty laundry…. of course, all my commander wonder why how come if you have such a good conduct but you aren’t going home, your parents is saying this and that, I told them about it, and after that, of course, they told me that they will try to prevent my parents from coming in, seeing me.[^11]”_

21     As will be evident from the turn of events discussed below, the Father’s attempts to contact the Son became more persistent and aggressive when faced with repeated rejections by the Son which, taken cumulatively, amounted to harassment.

#### 3 February 2019

22     The Son’s evidence is that on 3 February 2019, the Father approached and followed the Son outside his camp. The Father shouted that the Son was a “cheater” and “unfilial”, and that he would follow the Son back to his residence and shame the Son in front of his neighbours and the Girlfriend’s parents. When the Son’s private hire car arrived, the Father tried to open the door and get in with the Son. The Son called for the police, who arrived and stopped the Father from following him[^12].

23     The Father admitted in his Statement that he had gone to the Son’s camp as it was Chinese New Year eve, but upon seeing him, the Son immediately took off in his private hire car[^13]. The Father amended his evidence at trial, admitting that he did try to get into the car with the Son so that he could speak to him longer[^14]. He conceded that he saw the police arrive, and the police advised him not to follow the Son[^15].

24     In my judgment, it is likely that the Father would have been speaking to the Son in an incessant and agitated manner. Whilst the Father denied calling the Son insulting names such as “cheater” or “unfilial”, it is borne in mind that the Father has admitted to calling the Son “unfilial” and using a four letter vulgarity on him previously[^16]. That the Father had tried to get into the car with the Son, despite the Son trying to avoid him, suggested a level of determination and persistence on the part of the Father in following the Son and communicating with him, notwithstanding it was clear the Son did not wish to engage with him. The Son had to get out of the car and call for police assistance, which demonstrated the level of frustration and desperation he must have felt in being unable to stop the Father from following him. As the Son testified during the trial:

> _“When the car arrived, he insisted to get in the car. Insisted, which means that if I open the rear door, he’s going to open the front door, he did. And if I went---I went to s---I went to close the front door, he went to open the rear door. I couldn’t get in the car. I have to tell the private hire driver, “I’m sorry, uh, you have to go first. I have to phone for the police.” I phoned for the police, the police did arrive, he was still shouting until the police calm him down and the police have to let me---tell me to---say, “I will---I will stop your father from following you. You can go first.[^17]”_

25     At this juncture, when the Son called the police to stop the Father from following him, it ought to have been clear to the Father that the Son was not receptive to his repeated advances. The Father had already approached the Girlfriend at her workplace, approached the Son at his camp and involved the Son’s commanders and supervisors. Attempting to force his presence on the Son was futile, and did not appear to be the solution to reconciliation with the Son.

#### 7 April 2019

26     The Son’s evidence is that on 7 April 2019, he saw his parents hiding at the building opposite his camp. He tried to avoid them, but they followed him calling him a “cheater”, used their mobile phones to film him and threatened to go to the Girlfriend’s residence to beat up her parents. The Son testified he had a recording of this incident but did not have funds to transcribe or translate. He called for police assistance, but his parents left before the police arrived. When he arrived back home, he saw his parents loitering at the void deck of the Girlfriend’s residence[^18].

27     In his Statement, the Father made no mention about going to the Son’s camp on 7 April 2019[^19], but only that he and the Mother had gone to the void deck of the Girlfriend’s residence. The Father’s evidence is that he and the Mother managed to speak to the Girlfriend’s parents at the void deck on that day, and produced a video recording where the Girlfriend’s parents assured they would speak to the Son about going home. However, at the trial, the Father admitted he had also gone to the Son’s camp earlier on that day. Further, he stated in his Statement that it was his daughter who had informed him of the Son’s residential address, but he did not know how she had discovered it. He however admitted under cross-examination that his daughter had discovered it through the Son’s online shopping account, which was linked to hers[^20].

28     This incident is the at least the third incident of the Father looking for the Son at his camp, demonstrating a level of repetition and persistence on the Father’s part. That the Son had called for police assistance again evidenced his exasperation and distress at the Father’s conduct. The Father further misused private and confidential information obtained from the Son’s online shopping account to ascertain the Son’s current residential address, and followed the Son from his camp back to his residence. For the Father to have also met the Girlfriend’s parents at the void deck on the same day, it meant that he would have laid there in wait for a period of time, monitored the surroundings, kept a lookout for the Son or the persons he is living with, and approached the Girlfriend’s parents when he saw them. It is not disclosed as how the Father was able to identify the Girlfriend’s parents.

#### 20 April 2019

29     The Father gave evidence that he and the Mother met with the Girlfriend’s parents at a taxi stand, who assured they would advise the Son to return home[^21].

30     The Son did not raise this incident in his Statement. This incident however demonstrated yet another attempt by the Father to contact and meet with the Girlfriend’s parents and repeat his same request to them, to no avail.

#### 23 June 2019

31     The Son’s evidence is that on 23 June 2019, as he saw the Girlfriend to the door when she was leaving their residence, he saw someone loitering at the staircase outside his residence. The Girlfriend later informed him through the phone that his parents had confronted her at the bus stop. He went down to the bus stop, his parents shouted at him and he called the police. The Father swung his arm at the Son and missed his chest. The Son and the Girlfriend went to wait at the void deck for the police to arrive[^22].

32     The Father tendered a video recording of the incident, admitting that he and the Mother had approached the Girlfriend at the bus stop. He however argued that he was not aggressive when speaking to the Girlfriend, and alleged it was the Son who had hit him when he went to the bus stop. The Father made a police report, went for a medical examination and subsequently filed a PPO application against the Son. The Father produced a medical report evidencing that he suffered from mild swelling. He however withdrew the PPO application against the Son in or around July 2019.

33     I accepted the Son’s evidence that the Father must have been lying in wait outside the Girlfriend’s residence. The Girlfriend corroborated this.[^23] In any event, whether the Father was directly outside the unit or at the void deck is immaterial. The fact remained that he had again laid in wait for a period within the vicinity of the Girlfriend’s residence, kept a lookout for the Son or the persons he is living with, and monitored their movements with the intention to approach and engage with them against their wishes. This would have been how he had managed to discover that the Girlfriend left home and was able to approach her almost immediately at the bus stop.

34     As for the Father’s argument that he was not aggressive to the Girlfriend, the Girlfriend’s evidence is that she felt traumatized and intimidated, given that the Father stood in front of her speaking in an agitated manner whilst the Mother stood behind her. This was also in the context of past incidents where the Father had confronted her at her workplace and kept going to her residence[^24]. The transcript of the conversation between them showed that the Father launched into a tirade of incessant words at the bus stop and threatened to keep going to the Girlfriend’s residence:

> “_\[XXX\]. can you help? Where is \[XXX\]. Is \[XXX\] at your place. I am asking \[you\] (sic) nicely. I am not picking a fight. It is not ideal if my son keeps staying at your house for long term. \[XXX\] must you be so cruel? Can you help. My child has not been home for half a year, which is 6 months. As parents we are very upset. Do you feel us? Where is your \[conscience\] (sic)? You will be a parent in the future, right? Can you do not be so heartless? Is he at home? Where is your mother_?” (words in square brackets replaced or added)

> “_We must resolve this matter. If not resolve, we will still follow up. If you do not speak up, we still come._”

> “_If you don’t want us to come, we have to resolve this matter.”_

35     At this point, the Father was aware the Son was living at the Girlfriend’s residence; other than approaching the Son and the Girlfriend, he had also approached the Girlfriend’s parents. The Girlfriend’s parents tried to intervene but to no avail. If the Girlfriend’s parents as the more mature adults could not assist the Father, why did the Father have to lie in wait for the Girlfriend, confront her as she was waiting for her bus, film her on video and threaten that he would keep going to her residence?

36     When the Son came down to the bus stop, matters escalated into a physical altercation between the Father and the Son. The video did not capture who had initiated the physical violence, but it is clear from the Father’s medical report that he suffered mild swelling from the incident. The recording also captured the Son saying “_call the police_” and “_If I see you again, I will break your leg, you try me_”[^25]. This resulted in the Father making a police report against the Son and filing a PPO application against him. The Father subsequently withdrew the PPO application in or around July 2019.

37     By this point, it would have been clear to the Father that his methods of reaching out to the Son, by following and confronting the Son and the persons he is living with, were intrusive and distressing to the Son. The Son was pushed to a corner to say that if he saw the Father again, he would break his leg. Matters escalated into a physical altercation between parties, resulting in the Son calling for the police, the Father making a police report, going for a medical examination, filing a PPO application against the Son in the Family Court and subsequently withdrawing the PPO. Yet, the Father continued to persist in his unwanted intrusions.

#### 17 August 2019

38     The Son’s evidence is that on 17 August 2019 at about 7.15AM, he opened his door and saw someone standing at the staircase who ran away upon seeing him. When the Son reached the bus stop below his block, he saw his parents standing at the junction holding up their mobile phones as if they were taking videos or photos. They boarded bus 358 when it arrived[^26]. The Son called for police assistance[^27].

39     The Father did not address this incident in the Statement, but accepted the seven (7) incidents raised by the Son as incidents where he had gone to the Girlfriend’s residence[^28].

40     At this juncture, it is borne in mind that the Father had just withdrawn the PPO application against the Son in July 2019. Yet, on 17 August 2019, the Father and the Mother persisted in going to the Girlfriend’s residence to loiter and lie in wait for the Son at an early hour of the morning at 7.00AM. They must have been aware of or monitoring the Son’s movements to know that they would be able to catch him leaving his residence at such an early hour. That the Son called for police assistance again belies the underlying distress he would have felt from such persistent behaviour. This however did not spell the end of the Father’s incessant stalking.

#### 31 August 2019

41     The Son’s evidence is that on 31 August 2019 at about 9.00AM, the Son saw through his door’s peephole that the Father was loitering at the staircase outside the Girlfriend’s residence. The Girlfriend confirmed that the Son informed her that someone was at the window[^29]. He called for police assistance, and the Father splashed a liquid at the unit’s door before leaving. When the police arrived, they saw liquid on the shoes and the door but could not identify what the liquid was[^30].

42     The Father’s evidence is that he had not heard from the Girlfriend’s parents for more than a week. Hence, he and the Mother went to the void deck of the Girlfriend’s residence hoping to bump into the Son, but did not go up to the unit. The Father saw the Girlfriend who picked up her phone and made a police report, and they left immediately [^31]. He denied pouring any liquid at the unit.

43     Having gone to the Girlfriend’s residence on 17 August 2019, the Father persisted in going there two weeks later on 31 August 2019. Even if the Father’s testimony that he did not go up to the unit is accepted, he was able to meet the Girlfriend at the void deck. This meant that he must have been lying in wait for a significant period of time, or aware of the movements of the Son and the Girlfriend, to be able to meet her at the void deck. The Girlfriend called for the police again. The Father knew that the Girlfriend’s parents had stopped responding to him, which would have signified to him that they no longer wished to engage with him. He however persisted in his unrelenting attempts.

#### 8 September 2019

44     The Son’s evidence is that on 8 September 2019 at 9.00AM, he saw the Father outside the Girlfriend’s residence, and when the Father saw him, the Father called him a “_cheater_”, “_unfilial child_” and “_out to cheat your girlfriend’s parents’ money_”[^32]. When the Father and the Mother saw the Girlfriend’s parents coming home, the Son’s parents shouted loudly with them and tried to block their way[^33]. The Son called for police assistance.

45     The Father’s evidence is that on 8 September 2019, he and the Mother did go up to the Girlfriend’s residence to approach her parents for an update, as they did not respond to his message. The Girlfriend’s parents saw them and went into hiding[^34].

46     After having gone to the Girlfriend’s residence on 17 and 31 August 2019, the Father went a week later on 8 September 2019. The Father’s admission that the Girlfriend’s parents ceased to reply and went into hiding would have demonstrated the amount of discomfort and distress on their part, to the extent that they had to hide from him.

47     The Son’s evidence is that after this incident, he gave the matter some thought and decided to file this PPO application against the Father in or around October 2019.

#### The credibility of the Son and the Father

48     Overall, I preferred the Son’s evidence to the Father’s, as the Father was not credible or consistent in his testimony. Other than the inconsistencies pointed out in \[16\], \[17\], \[23\] and \[27\] above, there were other contradictions in the Father’s evidence. For example, in response to the Son’s allegations that the Father had loitered outside the Girlfriend’s unit on several occasions, the Father testified that he had never gone up to the Girlfriend’s residence, save on the last incident on 8 September 2019. However, in his police report in relation to the incident on 23 June 2019, he stated that “_\[j\]ust as we were about to go up to the unit, my wife saw \[the Girlfriend\] at the bus stop opposite_”[^35] (words in square brackets replaced). This suggested that as of 23 June 2019, the Father already had a habit or intention of going up to the Girlfriend’s residence. The Father further claimed he did not shout at or insult the Son, the Girlfriend or her parents on these occasions. However, I found it difficult to believe that the Father would have acted in a calm and reasonable manner when he is (a) someone who has admitted to calling the Son unfilial and using a four letter vulgarity on him over a laptop; (b) someone who had caused such a scene at the Girlfriend’s workplace that the human resource had to contact the Son, as evidenced by the text message received by the Son; (c) someone who launched into a tirade of incessant words when confronting the Girlfriend, as evidenced by his own very video of the 23 June 2019 incident; and (d) someone who failed to cease in his persistent behaviour and gain any insight into the distress caused to the Son, despite the repeated police involvement and culmination in legal proceedings in June 2019. The Father also denied filming the Son or the Girlfriend on video, but it is observed that he conveniently produced three videos of the Son, the Girlfriend and the Girlfriend’s parents filmed by him from as early as January 2019. In these circumstances, I preferred the Son’s testimony on the incidents raised by him, including that the Father had acted in an aggressive manner by shouting at him, insulting him and making threats against him.

#### The cumulative effect of the various incidents caused anguish to the Son

49     Each of the above incidents, taken in isolation and by itself, might seem trivial or minor in that the Father was merely approaching his Son and those whom he is living with, to get the Son to return home. However, as stated, I preferred the Son’s evidence that the Father had been insulting, threatening and harassing over his multiple visits. In any event, the cumulative effect of relentlessly approaching and confronting the Son, following him, loitering in wait for him at his camp and at the Girlfriend’s residence, monitoring his movements, having a physical altercation with him, approaching and confronting the Girlfriend at her workplace and her bus stop, approaching and confronting the Girlfriend’s parents outside their residence, and filming them on video, evidenced a quality of repetitive and persistent conduct on the Father’s part that would have been distressing to the Son. It is akin to rejection stalking, where the Father, having been rejected by the Son, repeatedly, unwantedly and disruptively intruded upon the Son’s life. The Father made a deliberate and calculated decision each time to stalk the Son, taking an hour to travel from his home in Jurong to the Girlfriend’s residence in Pasir Ris, and another hour to travel back[^36]. The Father lacked insight into the impact of his unrelenting conduct on the Son, and bore reckless disregard for the distress, dismay and annoyance caused to the Son and those he is living with. In my view, the separate acts that make up the intrusion might not by themselves cause emotional, psychological and mental anguish, but the frequency, persistency and intensity of these acts taken together caused such anguish on the Son’s part, placing him in fear of the Father following and confronting him or his loved ones.

#### The Father knew or ought to have known that these acts would cause anguish to the Son

50     In my judgment, the Father knew or ought to have known that his persistent conduct would cause the Son anguish. The Son had made it clear to the Father than he wanted to move out, rejected the Father’s advances multiple times and further called the police to stop the Father from following him or coming to the Girlfriend’s residence repeatedly.[^37]

51     The Court of course empathizes with the Father’s position that he missed the Son and only wanted him to return home. However, the Father’s parental love and authority over the Son did not confer upon the Father _carte blanche_ to engage in a series of dogged and unwanted acts of stalking and harassing the Son, the Girlfriend and the Girlfriend’s parents. The Son’s evidence is that he had left home because the Father was an abusive person, and it was not the first time the Father had asked him to leave. The Son did so this time as he now has the financial means. The Mother corroborated the Son’s evidence in this regard when she testified that the Father used violence on her and only ceased when she returned to work five or six years ago[^38]. The Son elaborated on the effect of the Father’s unrelenting conduct on him at the trial:

> _“Harassment including shaming, saying that I’m cruel to them, I’m unfilial, all these kinds of words and I’m, of course, afraid for myself that every time I step out of the residence, I have to look around whether there’s someone following me or not. Whether someone will follow me to my workplace and shame me just like how it was done to my girlfriend”;_

> _“how I have to be fearful when I leave my residence, how each and every single time when I leave my residence, I’m afraid that they will be standing outside shouting, saying that I’m unfilial and all my neighbour---all my neighbours will wonder what have this person done to their parents”;_

> _“My girlfriend’s parents decided to stop and talk to them is because they are worried that he might do something. He might---I---I don’t know what he might do but they are just afraid.[^39]”_

52     The Girlfriend also testified that she had told her father to inform the Father not to go to their residence anymore, as she was terrified. She and her parents called for the police several times when they saw the Father, and the police advised her to gather evidence and file for a protection order[^40].

53     The Father himself conceded that he would now let the Son lead a quiet life and would not look him anymore[^41]. This meant that he acknowledged the distress he had caused to the Son and come to a realization that forcing himself on the Son would in fact push him further away.

#### Necessity

54     In my view, it is necessary to issue a PPO in favour of the Son to protect him from the Father’s unwanted intrusions and harassment, before the situation becomes more serious or entrenched, and either party acts out of desperation against each other. On 23 June 2019, a physical altercation had already taken place between parties, and matters could escalate further if the Father persisted in his relentless behaviour and confrontations ensued. The last time the Father had gone to the Girlfriend’s residence was on 8 September 2019. However, it is likely from the Father’s pattern of conduct that he would have persisted in stalking and harassing the Son, if the Son had not filed a PPO application in October 2019 and obtained a temporary protection order (known as an expedited order) against him. Whilst the Father now expressed remorse and indicated he would stop visiting the Son, this concession only came about at the hearing stage. The Son also indicated that he was not prepared to accept the Father’s undertakings in this regard. A PPO is thus necessary to cement the Father’s resolve to cease in his repetitive conduct and help maintain a peaceful _status quo_.

55     For the avoidance of doubt, the Court is not making any judgment as to whether it is justified or reasonable for the Son to have left home at such young adulthood. Nor is it the Court’s intention to prevent the Father from attempting reconciliation and reunification with the Son amicably. Rather, it is hoped that with a PPO in place, the Father would desist from his persistent _methods_ of harassing the Son, including stalking him and forcibly imposing himself. He should give the Son some breathing space, a peace of mind and an opportunity to recover from any resentment and bitterness that has clearly been built up towards him. The Son’s declaration that he would never return home would naturally be disheartening to his parents. I have thus ordered parties to undergo mandatory counselling at a family violence service centre and fixed a counselling review in the Family Court in six months’ time. It is hoped that with the passage of time, a healing space and the intervention of professional counselling, the relationship between the Father and the Son would undergo a conciliatory process, and the Son would find it in the depths of his heart one day to reconcile with the Father.

## D.    Conclusion

56     In these circumstances, I issued a PPO against the Father in favour of the Son.
