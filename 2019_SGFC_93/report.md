Family Law – Ancillary Matters

6 September 2019

### District Judge Christine Lee:

### Introduction

1       This an appeal by the Mother against the whole of the Court’s decision given in the Court Order dated 28 May 2019 regarding the ancillary matters of this divorce case.

### Background Facts

2       The Plaintiff Mother (“the Mother”) and Defendant Father (“the Father”) married on 15 September 2006 in Singapore. The Mother is a \[XXX\] citizen with Singapore Permanent Residency, whilst the Father is a Singapore citizen. There are two (2) children of the marriage namely, \[B\] (female) Date of Birth \[xxx\] 2009 now aged nearly 10 years and \[C\] (female) Date of Birth \[xxx\] 2012 now aged about 7 years (“the said 2 children”).

3       The marriage lasted about 12 years before the Mother filed Writ of Divorce on 16 July 2018. CFRC Certificate was issued on 22 October 2018.

4       The divorce proceedings were set down on an uncontested basis and Interim Judgement (“IJ”) was granted on 27 November 2018 based on the fact that the Mother had sufficiently proven the contents of the Statement of Claim and the marriage was dissolved by reason that the Father had behaved in such a way that the Mother cannot reasonably be expected to live with the Father.

5       According to the Statement of Claim there were 7 Ancillary Matters (“AM”) to be decided by the Court.

### Hearings before the Court

6       However, on 16 January 2019 the Father filed SUM 199/2019, for an order that a Child Representative be appointed to represent the said 2 children in the AM proceedings. The Mother opposed this application on the grounds of the costs that the Parties would incur and because the Mother was of the view that this would amount to 3rd party interference and she did not want the said 2 children to be involved in their divorce matter.

7       Hence, on the first day of hearing being 2 April 2019, the Court dealt with the Father’s summons application first as a preliminary issue before continuing to the AM hearing. After the submissions were completed for both the summons application and the AM issues, the Court directed that further Affidavits were to be filed by both the Mother and Father, in order to provide the Court with additional information to make a decision.

8       The Father provided his Further Affidavit on 23 April 2019 and the Mother provided her Further Affidavit in Reply on 7 May 2019. However, at the next hearing on 28 May 2019, the Court noted that both Parties had also filed additional Affidavits without leave of the Court.

9       The Father had filed another Affidavit by a third party, which produced the same exhibit that had been filed in the Father’s Further Affidavit dated 23 April 2019. In the Court’s view, this additional Affidavit did not add anything new to the Father’s case and there would be no prejudice to the Father’s case if it was struck out. More importantly, there would be prejudice to the Mother’s case as the Mother was not given an opportunity to respond to this additional Affidavit. As such, the Court ordered that this additional Affidavit be struck out.

10     As for the Mother’s additional Affidavit, the Court was of the view that because the Mother’s additional Affidavit contained her proposals on care and control of the said 2 children, which was essential to the Court’s decision on the AM issues, the Court allowed this additional Affidavit by the Mother.

11     The Court then proceeded to deal with the Father’s application in SUM 199/2019 and dismissed this application as the Court was of the view that it was not necessary for a Child Representative to be appointed for this case. The Court also proceeded to deliver its decision on the AM issues.

12     The Mother filed Notice of Appeal on 6 June 2019 in HCF/DCA 67/2019 against the whole of the Court’s decision made on 28 May 2019 on the AM issues (“the said Court Order”).

### Summary of the Court’s reasons for making its Order

14     The crux of the AMs hearing was the issue of whom should have care and control of the said 2 children. The Court noted that the Father is now 61 years old and has health issues whilst the Mother is much younger at 42 years old.

15     The Court was informed that the said 2 children were living with the Father in the matrimonial home, which was a Housing Development Board (“HDB”) rental flat in the Father’s sole name and that the Father intended to retain this rented HDB flat so that there was no disruption to the lives of the said 2 children.

16     However, the Court was also informed at the time of the AM hearing, that the Mother had been moving into and out of the matrimonial home on several occasions thereby leaving the Father to take care of the said 2 children. Following the issuance of the AM Court Order at the hearing on 28 May 2019, the Court was informed that the Mother had moved out of the matrimonial home again on 3 or 4 May 2019 and had not returned to the matrimonial home since then. This reinforced the Court’s assessment that the Father was better able to provide a stable environment for the said 2 children.

17     In view of the facts submitted before the Court on the previous and existing care arrangements for the said 2 children, the Court’s assessment was that, despite his age and health condition, the Father was the primary caregiver of the said 2 children and that maintaining this status quo would be in the best interests of the welfare of the said 2 children.

18     The Court also took into account the fact that the Father was a Singapore citizen and the said 2 children are also Singapore citizens. In the Court’s view, this was relevant as the Father would have access to financial assistance for the said 2 children’s school and other needs that would not be available to the Moher.

19     Following the Court’s decision to award care and control to the Father, the Mother’s Counsel sought clarification on why the Father had been granted care and control of the said 2 children when his food stall was not stable yet and the Father was getting financial assistance. It was submitted to the Court that this could cause problems subsequently in relation to Father being awarded care and control as food stalls opened and closed all the time and the Father only had a few hundred dollars in his bank account.

20     The Court had already weighed this against the fact that the Mother was also relying on her own business which the Mother’s Counsel had in fact, submitted was a business which fluctuated. The Court was therefore of the view that this was not a case whereby the Mother had a more stable income as compared to the Father.

21     Before making its decision on the AM issues, the Court had also asked each Party what they would like for access to the said 2 children if care and control was given to the other Party. This was to allow the Court to consider the range of access that each Party would like to have, if they were not granted care and control of the said 2 children.

22     Hence, in making its decision to award care and control to the Father, the Court ensured that the Mother was given liberal access to the said 2 children which was more access than the access that she was prepared to give to the Father, had she been granted care and control. The Mother was only prepared to offer the Father “reasonable access during the weekends and weekday access subject to the said 2 children’s tuition schedules or school activities”. The Court granted the Mother weekend and weekday access as well as birthday access, alternate public holidays and alternate halves of the said 2 children’s school holidays.

23     However, at the request of the Father, as the Mother was a non-Singaporean, the Court also provided in the said Court Order that the Mother was not allowed to take the said 2 children out of jurisdiction to her home country, without the Father’s consent or leave of Court. Both Parties were otherwise granted liberty to take the said 2 children overseas for the school holidays.

24     To ensure that the Mother’s parental rights were preserved to the extent possible, the Court also ordered that the Father and the said 2 children were to remain contactable by the Mother for the purposes of arranging her access, that the Mother had the right to be designated on the said 2 children’s records as a person to be contacted in the case of a medical emergency, that the Mother be informed if either of the said 2 children fall ill and is hospitalised, that the Mother be kept informed by the Father of the major decisions regarding the said 2 children’s welfare and that the Mother have the right to contact the said 2 children’s schools directly and attend parent & teacher sessions.

25     The Court also provided for a code of conduct between the Parties to ensure civility between them in the best interests of the said 2 children. The Court further provided for counselling for both Parties as well as the said 2 children so as assist the Parties and the said 2 children to deal with the impact of the divorce proceedings. In this regard, the Court specified that the Father was also to ensure that the said 2 children attend the Children-In-Between programme to be arranged by the agency to be appointed by the Ministry of Social and Family Development.

26     The Court did not order any division of the matrimonial assets as the Parties had agreed to retain their own assets and there was no matrimonial home to be divided. The Parties had also agreed that there was to be no maintenance payable by the Father to the Mother.

27     However, the Court provided for the Mother to pay the sum of $200 per month ($100 per child) to the Father as maintenance for the said 2 children. The Court noted that the Mother had offered to solely maintain the said 2 children if she had been granted care and control of them. As such, the Court was of the view that the payment of $200 per month for the said 2 children’s maintenance by the Mother was reasonable.

28     Finally, the Court made no order on Costs and, as the Father’s Counsel asked for a Penal Notice to be included, that this be applicable to both Parties.
