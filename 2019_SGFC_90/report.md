Family Law – Ancillary Matters

30 August 2019

### District Judge Kathryn Thong:

## Introduction

1       This was a 25-year marriage. Parties have a 20-year-old son, Wilson, and had built up a salon business together through the years.

2       There was nothing exceptional in the present case relating to the matrimonial assets, save for a condominium known as the ‘Seahill’, that the Defendant Husband had purchased several years in his sole name, and was seeking to omit from the matrimonial pool. At dispute also was the value of the salon business for which the Husband claimed was operating at a loss.

3       The Husband who was self-represented until a week before the ancillary matters hearing, sought for parties’ matrimonial home to be divided equally between themselves and had no proposal for all other matrimonial assets. The Plaintiff Wife sought a just and equitable division of all matrimonial assets.

4       Custody and care and control of Wilson was not contested. In any event, Wilson had expressed his desire to remain living with his mother. Eventually I ordered that the matrimonial assets be divided 48.5% and 51.5% in favour of the Husband. The Husband has appealed against my decision.

## Background

5       Parties were married on 9 October 1993. The Wife is 50 years old, and the Husband, 54 years old. Wilson was born on New Year’s Day in 1999. The divorce suit was commenced on 6 November 2017 and interim judgment was granted in May 2018 based on parties’ claim and counterclaim of unreasonable behaviour. Both are trained, professional hairstylists.

6       At the time of hearing, the Wife was working as a freelance hairstylist on weekends and also training to be an infant care teacher at a childcare centre.

7       The Husband was working as a part-time driver with GrabTaxi, and also remained the sole proprietor of the hair salon parties had established together (“the Salon”). The Salon was located within the Central Business District. His claims that it was operating at a loss was not borne out by any evidence.

8       The Salon had been started jointly by the parties in 1995, even though it was registered as a sole proprietorship in the Husband’s name. From 1995 to 2017, the Wife worked at the Salon as did the Husband. Throughout the years, it was undisputed that she drew a meagre salary there.

9       On 31 December 2017, the Wife left the Salon. The Husband claimed that she poached the Salon’s customers for her own hair salon business, causing the Salon’s business to suffer. In the same breath however, he portrayed the Wife as a mere employee of the Salon.

10     At the time of the hearing, the family was still residing together in the matrimonial home, a condominium in Clementi Park (“the Clementi Condominium”).

11     Parties had not always resided in a condominium. Their very first matrimonial home was actually a Housing and Development Board (“HDB”) flat in Choa Chu Kang (“CCK”), purchased in 1992 for $86,500 and sold in 2006 for $235,000.00. The cash proceeds of some $104,000 (after the requisite CPF refunds were effected) was applied towards the purchase of the current matrimonial home, the Clementi Condominium, which cost over $500,000. Parties took out a mortgage with Development Bank of Singapore (“DBS”) to pay for the home, and both parties, by way of Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) and cash, paid for the monthly instalments.

12     In 2012, the Husband purchased the Seahill condominium (“the Seahill”) in his sole name. The Wife explained that the Husband pitched the idea as an “investment” which would eventually go to Wilson, and that it would be “easier” if the property was purchased in his sole name. The Wife went along with this idea.

13     To finance the purchase of the Seahill, parties refinanced their aforesaid DBS loan with the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (“HSBC”), which in turn, extended to parties a further term loan of $275,000 (“the term loan”) secured against the Seahill.

14     As a co-mortgagor and borrower of the HSBC loans, the Wife would pay $700 per month from her CPF until 31 December 2017; $400 per month in cash, by way of deduction of her salary from the Salon until 31 December 2017, and $1,500 per month in cash from 1 January 2018 onwards, as her CPF account had since been depleted.

15     In addition, the Husband also took out a separate loan with Overseas-Chinese Banking Corporation (“OCBC”) for $380,000.00 which he claimed was to pay for the Seahill. No evidence was adduced to this end.

## Husband’s credibility and conduct in the proceedings

16     Prior to the ancillary matters hearing, the Husband had been ordered to produce key documents such as his income tax returns of the Salon; records of the earnings of the Salon’s employees; revenue earned by the Salon and other records that would have assisted in the ascertainment of the value of the Salon. None were so produced. The Husband’s position was that the Wife was not entitled to such documents as she was a mere employee of the Salon.

17     Nor did the Husband comply with orders to _inter alia_, disclose details of sale proceeds of a car he sold in 2016, claiming that the Wife had not contributed towards its purchase, or details of an insurance pay out for cancer in 2007. The Wife’s position was that the car had been sold for some $70,000.

18     While litigants-in-person may lack understanding of procedures and the law, these were orders of court to produce documents and were straightforward in nature. Further, the Husband had been given ample opportunities to present his case and had filed multiple affidavits which were repetitive and irrelevant and without leave of Court.

19     Shortly before the ancillary matters hearing, the Husband appointed a Mr Joseph Chai to act for him. A summons was filed together with a 140-page supporting affidavit, to adduce evidence. The basis was that the Husband being unrepresented prior, had not understood what was expected of him. This resulted in him annexing documents to his ancillary matters checklist. Ms Loh Wah Mooi, counsel for the Wife, objected vehemently to the eleventh hour application. She pointed out that there had been 8 case conferences prior and at one of them, she had put the Husband on notice his non-compliance with a September 2018 Order for discovery and interrogatories. When asked if he required more time to comply, the Husband said no.

20     After going through the documents, I allowed part of the affidavit and its accompanying exhibits to be admitted as I found them to be relevant. They did not however, alter the complexion of the case. Notably, most of the information previously ordered to be disclosed, remained undisclosed in this latest affidavit of the Husband’s. As a point of interest, the Husband produced a document of his own authorship presumably to prove that the Salon was operating a loss. No supporting basis to explain how the figures were derived, or objective evidence was produced as to why the figures were as such. I did not allow this document to be admitted as evidence. But the larger point here, is that this document could have been produced much earlier, as it was patently clear that the value of the Salon was to be ascertained.

## The Matrimonial Pool and Value thereof

21     The table below sets out the parties’ assets and the Court’s findings of the value thereof. There was no dispute as to the date of ascertaining the pool which counsel accepted is generally taken to be the date of Interim Judgment, and the date of valuing the pool, which is usually the date of the ancillary matters hearing. I saw no reason to depart from these established positions. I should add that owing to the Husband’s failure to produce the relevant documents, the values attributed to the various assets had to, necessarily, be based on the Wife’s documents which were the only evidence available.

22     Parties assets were as follows:

23     I deal with the disputed assets in _seriatim_. At the outset, I point out that because of the Husband’s failure to produce the relevant documents, the values attributed to the various assets were necessarily based on the Wife’s documents which were the only evidence available.

24     As regards s/n 18, which was the parties’ erstwhile joint account with UOB, this had since been closed. The Wife claimed to have no knowledge of its closure; the Husband protested that the Wife had attended at the bank with him to close the account. However, the bank slip only reflected the Husband’s signature in this regard, and given the relationship between parties at the time, I found it unlikely that the Wife would be present. Besides, there was no reason for the Wife to be there to witness the closure of the bank account when there was only a meagre sum of $509 left. In fact, the converse was likely – precisely because there was so little left in the joint account, it would have been preferable for the Husband that the Wife not be there to question him.

25     Indeed, the Wife produced a statement reflecting the balance of $54,908.18 in this joint account as of 31 August 2017. However, when it was closed by the Husband on 5 March 2018, there was only $509.74 remaining. The Husband claimed that the monies had been used on the family and the refinancing of the mortgages. His claims however, were unclear and unsupported by objective evidence.

26     Eventually, I found that the sum of $54,398.44 ought to be attributed to the Husband. I arrived at this figure by subtracting the sum of $509.74, which was transferred to Wilson as evidenced by the bank transfer slip, on the same day that the account was closed.

27     The reason why the aforesaid sum was solely attributed to the Husband despite it being a joint bank account was because given the Husband’s manner of controlling the finances and expenses of the family, I was of the view that he was responsible for the withdrawals. It was also notable that the Husband did not suggest that the Wife had drawn down from this account and hence, the withdrawals had to be imputed to him. To belabour the point, there was no evidence or convincing explanation as to why the balance had dwindled from $54,980.18 to a mere $509.74 within a span of 7 months. Given that he had claimed to have used the monies on the family, one would have expected a paper trail of these expenses.

28     I thus returned the sum of $54,980.18 to the pool on the authority of _TNK v TNL_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 15</span> (“_TNK v TNL_”). In that case, the Court of Appeal stated that where divorce proceedings are imminent and substantial monies are expended by one party which the other spouse may be said to have a putative interest in, then such monies must be returned to the pool, if that spouse has not agreed, either expressly or impliedly to the expenditure either before it was incurred or at any subsequent time. Notably, this applies whether the monies were dissipated or expended for the children’s benefit. In the present case, the divorce proceedings were commenced in November 2017. I was however of the view that a divorce would have been regarded as imminent by the Husband at the latest, by end October 2017, when the Husband allegedly told the Wife to use whatever evidence she had to commence divorce proceedings against him.

29     Given that last known balance in this UOB account of $54,980.18 was as of August 2017 before it was inexplicably reduced to $509.74, I found it appropriate to use the figure, even though it pre-dated October 2017. In this regard, I note that the Court has returned monies to the pool even before divorce proceedings were commenced, for instance in the case _TVJ v TVK_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHCF 1</span>. In that case, the High Court took into account unaccounted withdrawals from a bank account from 2008 to 2014 even though the divorce was filed in 2013. The Court drew an adverse inference against the husband given his non-disclosure of certain assets, substantial unexplained withdrawals and unexplained high expenses, and added a conservative sum back to the pool. I applied a similar approach here.

30     In relation to the OCBC account at s/n 19, this account was not disclosed in his first affidavit. In any event, the Husband claimed that this account was used to service the term loan and rental proceeds from the Seahill condominium were received by him through this account. Mr Chai submitted that the rental proceeds and Seahill could not be matrimonial assets because the Seahill condominium was paid for by the Husband. I found no legal foundation for this argument. The Seahill condominium was an asset purchased during the marriage and flowing from this, the rental proceeds would be a matrimonial asset as well. The prerequisites of section 112(10(b) were fulfilled and I found Mr Chai’s contention bizarre. He would repeat this submission in relation to the Salon, the Salon’s corporate account, the sale proceeds of a car and also an insurance payout, submissions which I found to be wholly without merit.

31     In relation to the CDP account, the Defendant claimed to have stopped trading in February or March 2018 and having sold off his shares, even admitting that there had been investment profits. However, his failure to disclose further information meant that the shares value as of 31 January 2018 of $109,580.00 ought to be returned to the pool based on _TNK v TNL_.

32     At s/n 21, this POSB account was the Husband’s trading account and similarly, I found it appropriate to add this amount back to the pool, applying the same approach as with the parties’ UOB joint account (see \[29\] above).

33     As regards the Salon, it will be recalled that Husband had failed to provide the necessary information and documents as ordered by the Court, for a valuation to be undertaken. In the premises, Ms Loh exhibited an article setting out two valuation approaches, which would respectively generate a ‘high value estimate’ and ‘low value estimate’. The said article suggested that both types of estimates would provide useful starting points for negotiations.

34     In the high value estimate, valuation is based on a multiple of 3 times pre-tax income plus inventory. In the low value estimate, valuation is based on up to 30% times gross revenue plus inventory.

35     Based on records of the Salon’s annual revenue for 2014 to 2017, and an estimate of the Salon’s inventory of $10,000.00, the high value estimate yielded $550,000, the low value estimate, $181,000.00. Ms Loh proposed that the average of both estimates – $365,000.00 – be adopted. Given that the Husband himself had failed to comply with the orders to allow a valuation to be carried out or some estimates to be made, I was of the view that the approach adopted by the Wife was only sensible in the circumstances. Besides, the Husband himself had not proffered any figures, even with counsel on board. Instead he had persisted in maintaining that the Salon was not a matrimonial asset. Eventually, I rounded down the valuation to $300,000.00 as this was but a rough approximation.

36     In relation to the Salon’s corporate account, it was only at the hearing before me that the bank statement was disclosed. Even so, this was for the month ending 31 January 2018 and not the most recent statement. Mr Chai submitted the Wife had no ownership of the Salon or its corporate account, and the monies be excluded from the pool. As I have adverted to earlier, this was without merit.

37     In the Court of Appeal case of _NK v NL_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 3 SLR(R) 743</span>, the Court of Appeal expressed that whilst on one hand it was not treating the husband in that case and the company as one simply because he was a majority shareholder of several companies, it was only just and equitable that it uncovered all the matrimonial assets available. _A fortiori_, the same principle would be applied here especially given that the Husband is the sole proprietor of the Salon. I thus ascribed the sum of monies in the corporate account as of January 2018.

38     In relation to the joint accounts with Wilson at s/n 22 and 23, the Husband stated that the monies all belonged to Wilson, and they were savings for Wilson’ future university education. These savings he claimed, came from Wilson’s national service salary; Chinese New Year red packets and contributions from the Husband himself. The Wife submitted that these monies be given to Wilson instead of being subject to division, and this seemed sensible. Accordingly, I excluded them from division.

39     In relation to s/n 24 – 27, I found it appropriate to award an uplift rather than assign a value for these assets, save that for the storage items, I did not think there was any basis to find that there were indeed items in the storage, much less that they could be deemed to be matrimonial assets, and declined to give an uplift in respect of this item.

## Division of the assets

40     Given the differing financial contributions by parties for the matrimonial home and the Seahill, I agreed with Ms Loh that the classification methodology was more appropriate than the global assessment methodology in determining their respective contributions. The Seahill was thus divided separately from the rest of the asset pool. As Mr Chai’s position was that the Seahill was to be excluded from division, he proposed the global assessment methodology.

41     As mentioned earlier, parties had used the proceeds from the sale of their first matrimonial home, the Choa Chu Kang flat, to pay for the Clementi condominium. Evidence from the Husband as to his direct financial contributions towards the CCK flat was patchy and unsupported by evidence, and in the premises, the Wife’s evidence was preferred. The breakdown was as follows:

42     In relation to the Clementi Condominium and the other matrimonial assets then, I found parties’ direct financial contributions to be as follows:

43     As for the direct financial contributions of the Seahill condominium, I found that 100% was to be attributed to the Husband, and 0% to the Wife since the monies had solely come from him. However, it was significant that the Clementi condominium, which the Wife has continued paying the mortgage for, was used albeit indirectly, to refinance the HSBC loans.

44     In 2012, 7 cheques were issued by the Husband from the HSBC term loan account, in favour of the Husband and the Salon, totalling some $270,000 (though one of them bounced and was returned to the Husband’s account). The Wife submitted that a substantial part of these monies must have been used to pay for the Seahill condominium and she should be accorded a 50% contribution towards the Seahill condominium’s purchase.

45     The Husband contended that the Wife had nil contribution towards the Seahill condominium. He claimed that the cheques were issued to be used on the family. His own evidence was that the 7 cheques were for his investments in the stock market; the Salon’s business; and short-term fixed deposits. There was however no evidence supporting his assertions.

46     In any event, I found that whilst the Wife had no direct financial contribution towards the purchase of the Seahill condominium, she was indirectly contributing towards the purchase of the Seahill condominium. In paying off the mortgage on the Clementi condominium, she was also paying off the HSBC term loan of which she was co-borrower. But for the Clementi condominium, it was reasonable to assume that parties would not have obtained a further term loan from HSBC to purchase the Seahill. Even if it were the case that Husband had obtained the $380,000 loan from OCBC to pay for the Seahill condominium and not paid for it from the HSBC term loan, it was notable that the rental income from the Seahill condominium was initially deposited into the parties’ joint UOB account. Subsequently, the Husband stopped depositing such rental into the UOB account and diverted it – he claims – to his OCBC account (s/n 19 above). Ms Loh submitted that if the Seahill rental proceeds had been used to repay the OCBC loan, then at least 50% ought to be attributed to the Wife.

47     In the round, rather than attribute a 50% direct contribution to the Wife for the Seahill condominium, which would in my view, be double counting her financial contributions as it was already taken into account in the contributions she was making towards the HSBC loan for the Clementi condominium, I found it more appropriate to factor this under the Wife’s indirect contributions.

48     In the realm of indirect contributions, a broad brush approach is particularly apt. At \[4\] of _UBM v UBN_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHCF 13</span>, the High Court observed that:

> Section 112 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“WC”) confers upon the court the power to order the division of the parties’ matrimonial assets. This power is to be exercised in broad strokes, with the court determining what is just and equitable in the circumstances of each case: _ANJ v ANK_ at \[17\]. The division of assets is founded on the ideology of marriage as an “equal co-operative partnership of efforts”, an ideology which accords equal recognition to spousal contributions whether in the economic or homemaking spheres: _NK v NL_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 3 SLR(R) 743</span> at \[20\].

49     Here, both parties were working throughout the marriage and both had grown their wealth together. The Women’s Charter recognizes marriage to be an equal partnership and this is particularly true here, where the business at the Salon allowed parties to take on a second property even before their matrimonial home was paid off. Though the Husband claimed that he had grown his investments from a $30,000 accident insurance pay out due to his own father, this was unsupported by evidence and it could not be disputed that the Salon – unlike investment profits - was the main, if not sole, income generator for the family, being almost as old as the marriage itself.

50     The Husband was clearly the one that made the financial decisions in the marriage, which facilitated the lifestyle of the family. While it was not a luxurious lifestyle, it did allow them to move up the real estate ladder. There was also mention of the Husband ferrying Wilson around in the car, and I found that the joint accounts the Husband had with Wilson, was an indication of the tight rein he had on the finances, even on Wilson’s behalf.

51     As for the Wife, it was undisputed and even highlighted by the Husband in submissions that she had taken a low salary throughout her years at the Salon, and a salary that was not only lower than the Husband’s, but also significantly lesser than that of the Husband’s mistress who was also working at the salon. While the Husband attempted to portray the Wife as a mere employee of the Salon, this was at odds with his claim that the Wife had poached the Salon’s customers after her departure from the Salon on 31 December 2017. A mere employee of the Salon who had meagre contributions towards the growth of the business would not have such material influence and impact on the business.

52     In _ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGCA 34</span>, the CA observed that where both parties are working, it is likely that the Wife has greater indirect non-financial contributions. In the present case, Wilson’s desire to remain living with the Wife was in my view, further indication that the Wife had a closer bond with him because of the time spent raising him.

53     It was also notable that despite not being a co-owner of the Seahill condominium, the Wife was made a co-borrower of the HSBC loans secured against it.

54     Assessed globally, I found that that a 55:45 ratio in favour of the Wife was just and equitable. As such, the resulting division was as follows:

55     Ms Loh had submitted that adverse inferences be drawn against the Husband and an uplift be awarded to the Wife’s share for certain assets (s/n 24-27). As pointed out earlier, the Husband had failed to comply with disclosure orders. Even after appointing Mr Chai, these documents remain undisclosed. The position taken at the hearing itself that many assets ought to be omitted from the matrimonial pool as the Wife had not paid for them or was not the owner, was most bizarre. Assuming that Mr Chai had correctly advised the Husband on the correct legal position, such a submission could then only stem from the Husband’s contempt for the law.

56     In relation to s/n 24, the OCBC fixed deposit was actually in relation to a loan taken out by the Husband for unknown reasons. The actual name of the account was “36 months’ Time Deposit”. While the Wife appeared to believe that this was a fixed deposit account, the text of the letter which was relied on to suggest the existence of such an account, does not directly support such an interpretation. It appeared to be a loan account instead. The Wife had believed that there were monies being channelled to (what she believed to be) this fixed deposit account, to keep them out of her reach, as well as monies being diverted to the Husband’s mistress.

57     On this score, it did appear that funds were being kept out of the Wife’s reach. I have already dealt with the parties’ erstwhile UOB joint account earlier, where there was no convincing explanation for why the monies were depleted so rapidly. Also, it was telling that the mistress whilst working at the salon, had in 2017 and 2018, earned an annual salary of $73,100 and $91,950 respectively. This was in contrast to what the Husband earned, which tended to hover in the region of $25,000 - $30,000 and the Wife’s earnings which were even lower at around $20,000.00. The Husband’s mistress was actually the parties’ former domestic helper, and it did appear that there was reasonable basis to suspect that monies were being diverted to her by the sheer amount of salary she was being paid. To add insult to injury, the Husband asserted that the Salon’s success was owing to the mistress and rested on her shoulders, justifying her high salary.

58     Aside from the likely diversion of funds, by his own admission, the Husband had possessed several “short-term fixed deposits” and he also had a “$25,000.00 fixed deposit” belonging to him, which was where the monies in the HSBC term loan had allegedly gone to. The existence of such fixed deposit accounts was not proven and nor were they disclosed.

59     I found that a 3% uplift was appropriate to account for the non-disclosure of the sale proceeds of the family car which the Wife alleged was some $70,000; the insurance pay-out for the Husband’s nose cancer in 2007 and the OCBC fixed deposit (if any) and other fixed deposit accounts not disclosed and monies being diverted away from the Wife. This 3% uplift was to apply to the division for the Clementi Condominium and other assets, resulting in a 48.5% share to the Wife, and 51.5% to the Husband. The Wife’s share thus came up to $641,230.51; the Husband’s $680,894.26.

60     As for the Seahill condominium, I found that the nett value was $370,657. This was based on an estimated value of $740,000, with reference to the URA caveats lodged in April 2018. The Husband’s suggested valuation of $690,000 was unsupported and hence the Wife’s valuation was preferred. The Wife’s 27.5% share in Seahill came up to $101,930.675, whilst the Husband’s 72.5% share came up to $268,726.325. The Wife’s total share was thus $743,161.19.

61     I ordered that the Husband was to transfer (other than by way of sale) his rights and interest to the Clementi condominium with no refunds to be made to his CPF account. In the alternative, the Clementi home shall be sold in the open market and the net proceeds shall be divided 48.5% to the Wife and 51.5% to the Defendant, and they were to refund their CPF account from their respective share of the sale proceeds.

62     To address the shortfall due to the Wife in either a transfer or a sale, the Husband would have to pay her the sum of $23,858.17 within a year from the date of the Order should a transfer take place, or the sum of $334,860.57 should the matrimonial home be sold in the open market, upon completion of the sale.

## Maintenance for the Wife

63     I found that the Wife was able-bodied and self-sufficient. Indeed, she is resourceful and capable as seen from her prospective job as a childcare centre teacher, which is an entirely different industry from the hairdressing business. She also continues to serve her clients on weekends. The power to award maintenance is but supplementary to the power to divide the asset and I believe that parties have received their fair share. I was of the view that the Wife’s share of some $740,000 out of a total asset pool of some $1,700,000 is sufficient for her to transit into post-divorce life and thus ordered that there be no maintenance for her.

## Wilson’s Maintenance

64     Wilson will be turning 21 in less than a year’s time. Though the Husband asked that no maintenance be payable, he accepted that he would bear half of his expenses if the Court so ordered. As I had ordered that the monies in the joint accounts jointly held by the Defendant and Wilson, be transferred to the Wife for Wilson’s use, I ordered monthly maintenance of $500 with effect from April 2019 to January 2020. I was of the view that he had to bear a reasonable proportion of Wilson’s expenses.
