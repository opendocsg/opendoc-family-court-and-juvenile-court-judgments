testamentary guardian – appointment of co-executors and trustees – fiduciary duties – duty to account – omission to act resulting in loss

10 May 2020

### District Judge Shobha G. Nair:

1       Orphaned at 13 years of age, the plaintiff claimed that the defendants did not fulfil their fiduciary duties as co-executrices and trustees of his late mother’s estate and asked for a true account of her assets. As the sole beneficiary of his mother’s estate, he sought the return of monies which he claimed were misappropriated by the first defendant. On account of the fact that the defendants were to act jointly in the administration of the estate and to hold all assets on trust for him until he attained the age of 21, the plaintiff claimed that the defendants were jointly and severally liable for losses sustained by him.

2       The following preliminary orders were made on 20 September 2019:

> That the defendants are on a common basis, to provide accounts for:

>> (i)       The rental proceeds received from tenants of \[Property Y\] from July 2005 to April 2012;

>> (ii)       The amount in 2 POSB savings accounts bearing numbers ending with 0046 and 8771, respectively from 15 November 2003 until the accounts were terminated;

> Further, it was directed that the following documents were to be obtained and produced at the next hearing:

>> (i)       The personal income tax documents of the first defendant for the period July 2005 to April 2012;

>> (ii)       The property tax paid or remain payable for Property Y for the period July 2005 to April 2012.

3       The hearing resumed on 11 October 2019. I had wanted to hear from a paternal aunt of the plaintiff on a few key issues that arose in the course of the first of hearing. The aunt attended on 11 October 2019 and gave her position on those matters. However, as many documents directed to be produced were still not available as at that date, further adjournments were granted and the following orders were issued on 3 February 2020:

> (i)     The defendants are jointly and severally liable for the sum of $87 498.24.

> (ii)     No interest on the judgment sum[^1]

> (iii)     No order on costs.

4       The second defendant appeals against all the orders. The first defendant has not lodged an appeal on any of the orders.

## Facts

5       The plaintiff’s mother \[S\] came to Singapore from Indonesia as a child. She is a cousin of the first defendant. The first defendant claimed that she helped the family find shelter on arrival and they earned a living selling cakes/pastries and providing tailoring services in the Tai Sing area in Singapore. After the first defendant got married, she continued to help the family but did not elaborate on this. S lost her father tragically. Soon after, she married and left the Tai Sing area. Unfortunately, her husband passed away in the 1990s leaving her to raise the plaintiff alone and with little means. A few years after her husband’s passing, she was diagnosed with nose cancer that took her life on 15 November 2003. Prior to her passing, according to the first defendant, “_S succeeded at persuading me to take up the thankless job of executing her will and become VGV’s guardian_”.[^2] A will appointing the first and second defendants as co-executrices and trustees and naming the first defendant as “legal guardian” of the plaintiff was executed on 30 September 2003.

6       The will provided, _inter alia_, for the defendants to hold S’s home, a Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat in Yishun, on trust for the plaintiff until the plaintiff turned 21 years of age. It further provided that all real, personal property, shares, jewellery, cash and monies in the mother’s bank accounts were to be held for the plaintiff until the latter turned 21. As the first defendant was named as the “legal guardian” of the plaintiff, the will provided that sums of money from the estate could be used for the plaintiff’s living and education expenses.

7       After the passing of the plaintiff’s mother on 15 November 2003, an application for probate was taken out and granted in May 2004. The Schedule of Assets which was filed reveal the following as assets of the plaintiff’s mother:

8       The defendants affirmed the accuracy of the contents of the Schedule of Assets before a Commissioner for Oaths and appended their signatures at the end of each page of that Schedule.[^3]

9       The plaintiff lived with the first defendant and her family after his mother’s passing although the precise date was not known. In November 2005, the first defendant managed to obtain the official approval of the HDB to rent out the Yishun flat. There was great divergence on the number and duration of the tenancy agreements that were entered into, the rental proceeds collected and the use of those proceeds. What was accepted is that the second defendant consented to the first defendant’s application to rent the flat to others (although the second defendant claimed that she “vaguely” remembered this). It was the second defendant’s position that she was minimally involved in the administration of the estate from the time she agreed to be appointed as co-executrix and trustee to the time this dispute arose. It was her evidence that she came to know the plaintiff’s mother when the latter was seeking help at the \[L\] Centre (a voluntary welfare organisation) sometime in 2000. The second defendant was a social worker at the L Centre. After 8 months of work there, she resigned from her post. She did not keep in touch with the plaintiff’s mother. She had presumably made a good impression on the plaintiff’s mother in that brief time she was at the Centre. This is because in 2003, the time the plaintiff’s mother was in very poor health, a medical social worker contacted the second defendant and asked her to consider being an executor of the plaintiff’s mother’s will. The second defendant stated that _“Helping her fulfil her last wish was something that I have never regretted”.[^4]_ She went on to say that she could not remember much about the probate application and the legal advice. She said she fully trusted the first defendant with the care of the plaintiff and did not wish to interfere in their family affairs.[^5] It was undisputed that the second defendant did not meet the plaintiff after the passing of his mother and the grant of the probate. There were a few telephone calls in the early years after 2003 but all contact ceased thereafter. It was only in 2018 that contact resumed when the plaintiff reached out to the second defendant via telephone messages saying that he had some family issues he needed to discuss. He was about 28 or 29 years of age at that time.

10     It was the plaintiff’s position that he struggled emotionally and financially growing up in the home of the first defendant. He was given insufficient pocket money, had to resort to external help for the payment of his school fees and school needs and worked from the time he was 14 years of age to support his basic expenses. He said that the rental monies the first defendant collected from the tenants at the Yishun flat were deposited into a joint account the first defendant held with him. He claimed that when he checked on the status of funds in that account and found that the account had been depleted with a noticeable recent withdrawal of $5 000, he queried the first defendant. “_She told me that she did not have to provide me with any explanation for her use of the monies._”[^6] In 2008, the joint account was closed and the monies were deposited into another account to which the plaintiff had no access.

11     Shortly after the plaintiff turned 21, the Yishun flat was transferred by the defendants to the plaintiff. He claimed that the flat was in a very poor condition, had no repairs done to damaged areas and the pieces of furniture that were originally in the flat were no longer there.[^7]

12     As an adult, the plaintiff started to pursue more vigorously an account of the assets of his late mother but the information was not forthcoming. It was only in June of 2018 that a letter of demand was sent through the plaintiff’s solicitors for a proper account. This was not met with a meaningful response, eventually leading to this action. The commencement of proceedings was met with an angry response by the first defendant.[^8] A transcription of a note send by the first defendant to the plaintiff read as follows:

> _“To the Tailless Dog – VGV: You have repaid my kindness with revenge. You have no brain (mindless) and money has changed you. I raised you for 14 years, but you have forgotten. Now that you have an old woman to rely on, you have become so proud of yourself that you want to sue me, to hurt me. You love money. You never think of the consequences. You speak carelessly: saying that we took your money to buy at Nirvana Gardens. Your big house has so much money for me to take. Aren’t you afraid that you are twisting your words \[rhetorical\]? If you love money so much, then call your \[paternal\] aunt and go get the money from the bank. Robbing the bank will bring lots of money. If I never helped you in the last 14 years, how did you survive until today? Think about it. Your elder \[paternal\] aunt told you to die and then you go to die. You are brainless. Your mother is dead, who will take care of you?_ _Nobody wanted you when your mother died but I took you in. You are ungrateful!_ _VGW – Closure. Go ahead and sue me! I’m not afraid!” (sic)_

13     Attempts were made to mediate the dispute. It was recognised that this case presented rather unique facts in that the appointment of the co-executrices and trustees was one borne out of an urgent need by a dying mother who did not appear to be close to other relatives she had in Singapore. The fact that the first defendant agreed to be the guardian of the plaintiff was undoubtedly a source of great relief. This action by the plaintiff against the guardian (the first defendant) and a remote acquaintance (the second defendant) appears to be unappreciative of the efforts of both. A deeper look at the matter however, revealed a different complexion and why the plaintiff had little choice but to take the steps he did.

14     Mediation proved unsuccessful, in no small part due to the fact that the first defendant was simply not forthcoming with proper accounts. Throughout subsequent proceedings in Court, she relied on lack of counsel and fluency in the English language as reasons for her inability although it is clear from the Defence filed, that help was afforded, perhaps from her previous counsel.[^9] She was also assisted by an interpreter at all times. The second defendant was not able to produce any information as she relied on her ignorance of what transpired between the first defendant and the plaintiff and her belief that there was no need to doubt the judgment of the first defendant as it related to the plaintiff’s welfare.

## Duties of co-executors and trustees

15     There is little room to debate the position that the defendants owe fiduciary duties to the plaintiff in relation to the administration of his mother’s estate. A climacteric aspect of this fiduciary relationship is the duty of the trustees to keep accounts. It is the right of the plaintiff as the sole beneficiary of his mother’s estate to be allowed inspection of those accounts when called for.[^10] This does not depend on showing there was a breach of fiduciary duties on the part of the trustees.[^11] The duty to furnish accounts is a continuous one.[^12] While it is appreciated that the defendants came to the aid of the plaintiff’s mother at a time when she perhaps needed it most, it does not vary their legal responsibilities to the beneficiary.

16     The fact that the testatrix chose her cousin to be an executrix of her will must have been based on the trust that the testatrix had in her. The same can be said of her choice of the second defendant. The choices need not be questioned provided the testatrix was of sound mind. There was no suggestion that she was not. Executors and trustees however should always be mindful that this trust calls for a perfect response by them to discharge their legal obligations with honesty and prudence. Where the beneficiary is a minor, this perfect response is easily trespassed by the human temptation to withhold information and assets from him as he grows into an adult. As an adult, he would have little knowledge of what had transpired over the years and would necessarily depend on the defendants for that knowledge. This is when the benevolent words of comfort by the defendants in 2003, when they agreed to act as co-executrices and trustees, will be tested. The fact that the second defendant chose not to be involved in the affairs of administration, allowed by that omission, for the temptation to keep matters away from the beneficiary to grow over 8 years of the plaintiff’s life. This makes her equally responsible as the first defendant. When a beneficiary is a minor, the need for checks and balances is an imperative. The second defendant failed in that role.

17     The second defendant’s position appears to put the responsibility on the minor. The questions by her to the plaintiff revealed that she felt that the onus was for a child to raise the alarm as opposed to an adult trustee to ensure that a minor’s interests are secured. The following were some of her questions that revealed this belief:

> _Q:_      _“I would like to ask you why have you not contacted me in the past, by now it’s actually 16 years, if you had felt that you were not treated well by Madam VGW”[^13]_

> _Q:_      _“And so, basically the question is, why have you not contacted me from the time your mum passed away to last year March if you have felt that I have my responsibility as the co-executrix of your mum’s will. But you have not contacted me for the last 16 years. So the question is why?”_

> _A:_      _Okay, uh, I do have contact with Madam VGX but she never talk about how I – I have struggled in – in – in that – in their family, uh, because, occasionally, uh, I live in fear because Madam VGW says that if you want to talk about the rental money to anybody, I would chase you out of the house”.[^14]_

18     It was also of concern that the second defendant was of the view that she could trust the first defendant and that she did not want to interfere with the family.[^15] She did not explain why she had such deep trust in the first defendant, having had limited if any interaction between 2001 and 2003 and even thereafter. Her evidence was that she contacted the plaintiff and the first defendant in the early years after 2003 and she recalled that the plaintiff was very much loved and taken good care of by the first defendant and her daughters. How she was able to ascertain this from irregular calls over a brief timeframe, without face-to-face or private conversations with the plaintiff is hard to appreciate. Even if she had that belief, it is easy to understand that this was a child who had just lost his mother and needed the security of a family and home. There was no suggestion that there was any violence by the family. I am sure he was reasonably safe.

19     The obligations of the second defendant however pertained to how the assets of the plaintiff’s late mother were to be properly administered. Her consent was needed for the HDB to approve a request by the first defendant to rent out the Yishun flat. For this, the decision was made jointly. She was similarly needed to ensure that the Yishun flat was transferred to the plaintiff when he turned 21 years of age. For this, the action was a joint one. Yet for all other assets, particularly the rental proceeds obtained from the very flat that was held on trust for the plaintiff, she saw no need to ensure those were retained for the plaintiff. She is in law expected to act jointly with the first defendant in ensuring that all, not some, of the assets of the testatrix were properly handed to the plaintiff upon his attaining 21 years of age. If after her appointment as co-executrix and trustee she felt that she could not honour her obligations in part or full, she could have taken the legal steps to step out of that role. She did not. She had complete trust in the first defendant although there was no sound basis for that trust other than the fact of appointment by the testatrix. She acquiesced by her silence, with all decisions taken by the first defendant and by virtue of their joint appointment, the decisions of the first defendant bound the second defendant. The second defendant’s liability arises from her omission to act in the interests of the beneficiary. The fact that the second defendant did not personally benefit from the monies retained by the first defendant does not militate against a finding that she was in breach of her duties. Men and women who are honest may still be negligent in the performance of their duties.

20     It is equally important to appreciate the danger in accepting the notion that a legal obligation to account to a minor can in some way be overridden or mitigated by the provision of shelter and other basic comforts to that minor.[^16] The only proviso is that the amount that may have been expended on the minor can be taken into account in determining the quantum that remains due to him.

## Rental proceeds from the Yishun flat

21     The exercise in determining the rental proceeds that was collected by the first defendant and which rightfully belonged to the plaintiff was a challenging one. Documentation was from the outset, non-existent. It was the plaintiff who managed to gather a few documents sent by the HDB to produce some idea of the amounts collected. It was on repeated insistence by the Court to take the necessary steps to produce an account that piecemeal efforts were taken by the first defendant with the help of the second defendant. A sketch of the true situation through invoices from a housing agent was painted. Looking at the evidence before me, I came to the conclusion that the first defendant was not a truthful witness and the second defendant defaulted on her obligations by washing her hands off the proper administration of the estate altogether. I accepted the plaintiff’s claim of $98 500 as rental proceeds collected over the years although this represented a figure a little short of my computation.

22     In her pleaded Defence[^17], the first defendant shared that the flat was rented between 22 July 2005 and September 2012 with a total of 8 tenants. She claimed that there was period of about 1 – 2 months after the expiration of each tenancy that the property was vacant. She then went on to say that for the years 2005 to 2009, the rental collected was $800 per month; in 2010 it was $1 000 per month and for the years 2011-2012, it was $1 200 per month. She also claimed that for each tenancy, there would be a commission that was collected by the housing agent. She did not mention how many agencies were engaged over the years. She also stated that she paid for property tax which she claimed was $800 per annum.

23     In the plaintiff’s affidavit[^18] he showed that the HDB had approved the subletting of the flat and the following was information he could gather from the HDB[^19]:

> From 1 November 2005 to 30 September 2008 : $500 per month

> From 1 October 2008 to 30 September 2011 : $1 600 per month

24     In court, questions on the tenancy periods gave rise to fluctuating positions and often times, incoherent answers. The first defendant claimed that the property was rented out for a 5-year period to 4 different tenants. She said she had only rented out a room and not the whole flat. Of significance is her evidence that she had rented it out even before obtaining approval from the HDB.[^20] From the HDB records, it appeared that approval was only given in November 2005. The fact that she rented it out before approval aligned with her Defence that she started to rent it out from July 2005. She was however inconsistent on the number of tenants she had and the time periods of each tenancy. The HDB records also show that the whole flat was rented out and not merely a room. This would have an impact on the rental income. The plaintiff stated that he was aware that the whole flat was rented out and save for a month when it was vacant, the flat was rented out for the entire period between 2005 until 2017 when he moved in. The claim he was making was only until 2012 when the flat was transferred to him but he maintained that the first defendant continued to collect and keep rental proceeds even after 2012.

25     Further to the oral evidence, documents were submitted by the first defendant on 9 November 2019 pursuant to the Court’s direction to write to the property agencies. Only 3 invoices were presented. All were from the \[D\] Group. One was dated 25 February 2009 for the period 10 March 2009 to 9 October 2009 for a monthly rental of $1 600; the second was dated 25 October 2009 for a period of 1 year at $1 400 per month and the last dated 15 October 2010 for a period of 1 year at $1 600 per month.

26     The contents of the invoices stood in sharp contrast to what was pleaded in the Defence. The invoices showed a different set of figures for 2009 and 2010 suggesting that the first defendant’s lack of candour for those years was indicative of a larger pattern of dishonesty in declarations made prior to 2009. The invoices also showed that there was a continuous flow of tenants at least for the periods that records were produced. The documents from D Group were unfortunately very limited. It did not provide information of the tenancy agreements prior to 2009. It is possible that other agents were engaged or no agents were involved. In the evidence of the paternal aunt, she stated that she was aware that the flat was rented out and that initial arrangements for tenants went on smoothly. She did not say when this was. When asked why she had not enquired about subsequent leases, she stated that the first defendant “_said had other agents to help her as well_.”[^21]

27     The income tax statements of the first defendant was requested for and on 27 September 2019, a response was obtained from the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS). The IRAS informed that the annual income of the first defendant for the period between 2005 and 2012 revealed a figure less than $22 000. The first defendant was accordingly exempted from paying income tax. The rental income was deposited into an account which was initially jointly held by the plaintiff and the first defendant. The name of the plaintiff was later removed by the first defendant. At the hearing, no statements were produced for this account. It was clear that the amount received was not declared to the IRAS possibly on account of it being seen as “trust money”. Yet, it was utilised for expenses which did not benefit the plaintiff and which if declared, may have brought it over the threshold income of $22 000 per annum (given that her income as a cleaner was as at 2018, $1 400 per month).[^22] I was not told of what was informed to the IRAS to assist the Authority in its determination of taxable income. I made no conclusions on the IRAS information.

28     Given the discordant evidence of the first defendant and the inability of the second defendant to shed any light on the matter given her lack of involvement, I accepted the claim of the plaintiff although the figure was a little short of the number I saw fit. Given the propensity of the first defendant to under-declare the amounts she received, I took the following approach. Wherever the first defendant gave written declarations at different times which showed different amounts of rental income received for the same period, I accepted the higher figure as more closely representing the actual amount received. I then looked at that figure in the context of the fact that the whole flat was rented out as opposed to just a room as well as the fact that rental rates could not have been dramatically less in the years before 2009 than the figures reflected in the invoices for the period 2009 – 2011. On the other hand, where a figure was from an independent source like a housing agent, I accepted that figure and no adjustments were made.

29     Although the amount was determined to be $99 000, I accepted the lower claim of the plaintiff for $98 500. This gives a small concession for any possible period of vacancy even though the evidence presented by the invoices show a constant flow of tenants for the period between 2009 to 2011. The suggestion was that she was never short of suitable tenants. The fact that no bank statements for the account that she deposited the rent into were produced, speaks of the probability that the figure above was but a modest representation of the income actually earned.

30     The figure of $3 077.71 verified as property tax paid by the first defendant for the relevant period was deducted from the figure of $98 500. It is noteworthy that in her pleadings, the first defendant declared inaccurately that a uniform annual tax of $800 was paid.[^23]

## Bank accounts

31     In the Schedule of Assets, 2 bank accounts of the testatrix were identified. One account with POSB bore the number ending with 0046 and had a balance of $12.57. No statements were available. The other was also a POSB account which bore the number ending with 8771 and which had a balance of $24 463.38.

32     The first defendant claimed in her Defence that there was only $12 000 in the account ending with 8771 as much of it was used to pay for medication and supplements when the testatrix was in poor health. This shift in position did not explain why $24 643.38 was revealed as the outstanding balance in that account at the time of the probate. Any payments for medicine or supplements would have been made before the testatrix passed away.[^24]

33     I called for determined efforts to be taken to provide bank statements for this account. A copy of a passbook was eventually submitted. It revealed that it was a joint account held by the plaintiff and his mother and it had in fact a balance of $26 463.38 as at the time of the plaintiff’s mother’s passing on 15 November 2003, $2 000 more than what was declared in the Schedule. On the day of her passing, 2 withdrawals of $1 000 each was made, leaving the balance as declared in the Schedule. The first defendant informed that she held an ATM card and would make withdrawals from this account on behalf of the testatrix when the latter was alive. She continued to have the card after the passing of the testatrix. There was no explanation of who withdrew this amount of $2 000. The first defendant suggested in evidence that she was forced by the paternal aunt to withdraw a sum of $3 000 to cater for funeral expenses. An invoice from a casket company for a sum of $3 100 was produced by the plaintiff[^25] but it was made out to a lady known as \[F\], disclosed to be the paternal aunt. The aunt denied asking the first defendant to withdraw any money. She also said she did not pay for the funeral expenses nor did she receive the donations given by family and friends for the funeral expenses. In any event, the figure of $3 000 stated by the first defendant as the amount she was forced to withdraw does not explain the 2 withdrawals of $1 000 each time on 15 November 2003. It was further noted that in stating that there was only $12 000 in the account, the first defendant’s position that $4 500 was used for funeral expenses did not square with what she said in court on being compelled to withdraw $3 000 for the funeral expenses.

34     The first defendant’s evidence on what the funeral expenses actually were, who and how they were paid for and who kept the contributions given by family and friends was nothing short of bewildering. When examining the plaintiff, she stated that the funeral expenses amounted to $25 000[^26] even at times raising it to $38 000 on further questioning. When confronted with an invoice made out to F for a sum of $3 100, she accepted this to be a possible figure.[^27] As to who paid for it and whether it was completely attended to from the donations received is unknown. I did not deduct the payment towards the funeral expenses in my calculations.

35     The amount in the joint bank account as at the time of the death of the testatrix belonged to the plaintiff. In approximately 6 months, between 15 November 2003 and May 2004, the amount in this account dwindled to zero. This was money that should have been held for the plaintiff and was taken into account in the computation of what ought to be paid to the plaintiff. I also took into account the sum of $12.57 in the account ending with 0046 as no explanation was given on what happened to this amount.

## Other assets

36     There were CPF monies referred to in the Schedule and this was provided to the nominated beneficiary.[^28] The nominee was not the first defendant and the identity of the beneficiary was kept confidential.

37     The other asset was jewellery. The first defendant stated that she had in her possession a gold chain, a ring and four smaller gold rings meant for a baby. She claimed to have melted it and made it into a gold chain and a gold pendant in the shape of a cross for the plaintiff. It was her evidence that the plaintiff rejected it as he did not like gold and that led her to change it into white gold. This chain made of white gold was accepted by the plaintiff. The plaintiff on the other hand, said that he was never presented with the gold chain and gold cross let alone reject it. He agreed that he was given a chain of white gold which he has kept. I did not make the defendants accountable for this asset as the evidence was sketchy and a safe conclusion could not be made. It is noteworthy that while jewellery was mentioned in the will, it was not stated in the Schedule of Assets.

38     It was also claimed by the plaintiff that his mother’s flat had many pieces of furniture which were no longer there nor accounted for when he moved back into the home in 2017. The list of items included a dining table and chairs, wardrobes, a television and console, and a refrigerator.[^29] There was no evidence of what happened to the furniture and I did not make any order on how much if any should be paid by the defendants. This was however borne in mind to set off any claims to deduct payments made by the first defendant for the commission of housing agents or perhaps for any brief period of time the property was not leased out.

## Deductions for living and education expenses

39     The testatrix’s will provided for the ability of the trustees to utilise money from the estate for the living and educational expenses of the plaintiff. I deducted an amount of $34 400 which was computed on the basis that an amount of $400 per month was a reasonable amount for his expenses from the time he started to live with the first defendant until the flat was transferred to him when he turned 21 (a period of 102 months). However, I shortened the period of time for which maintenance should be calculated for a few reasons.[^30] One, it appears that the plaintiff only started to live with the first defendant in 2004 and not from November 2003[^31] although it is not clear in which month of 2004 this was. The additional months that were shaved off from the period between November 2003 and April 2012 was to work into the equation the reality that $400 per month was probably too generous to be applied at the same rate throughout that period. This is because the plaintiff worked odd jobs from the time he was 14 years of age. The evidence of \[C\], a friend from the church the plaintiff attended,[^32] disclosed that he had known the plaintiff since the latter was 16 years of age. He gave evidence that the plaintiff was often late for choir practices as he was rushing in from various jobs that he used to take on to cater for his expenses. Although it was the plaintiff’s evidence that he worked odd jobs throughout the time he was staying with the first defendant as evidenced by ad hoc pay slips,[^33] it was difficult exactly how much he earned in total. What C’s evidence did was to lend weight to the fact that the first defendant did not have to utilise much of the rental monies for the plaintiff’s needs.

40     There was much dispute on how the first defendant had provided for the plaintiff. The plaintiff when cross-examined stated at many points that he was not adequately provided for. He claimed that school fees were paid from his Edusave account, fees at the Institute of Technical Education from his Post-Secondary Education Account and his fees at the LaSalle College funded by external sources. This was largely undisputed save that his primary school fees of $12 per month appears to have come from an undisclosed bank account while the second-tier miscellaneous fees was paid from his Edusave account. An example of how educational expenses were not properly catered for despite the available resources meant for him, was the evidence of C. He recalled an occasion when he announced that his company was giving away some computers after ceasing operations when the plaintiff had approached him to receive one of those computers for school purposes.

41     The plaintiff claimed that he was given $5 per day as school pocket while the first defendant claimed it was $10 daily. The plaintiff also stated that all his additional school expenses were paid for by bursaries and scholarships from Buddhist charities and the Lee Foundation. Given the totality of the evidence, the amount of $34 400 is likely to be a generous award for the living and educational expenses of the plaintiff. I gave the benefit of doubt to the defendants in spite of the fact that the plaintiff appeared to have led a life of financial independence for a child so young.

## Conclusion

42     Both defendants are accountable jointly and severally to the plaintiff. They failed in their duties as joint executrices and trustees of the estate of the plaintiff’s mother. It is important to understand that the responsibilities of executors and trustees in general, are onerous. If it cannot be performed, it should not be accepted. Once accepted and not subsequently renounced, then liability must be attached when a trustee does little to ensure that the interests of the beneficiaries are secured. It is ever so important in the context of minor beneficiaries.

43     While the motive of the second defendant in agreeing to assist the plaintiff’s mother was unquestionably benevolent, those who seek to assist terminally ill parents who have little choice but to leave the lives and fates of their children in the hands of others, do no justice to those parents if after the show of benevolence, they do nothing. This child had to witness the deaths of both parents. The joint actions of the defendants to advance the trust reposed in them by the testatrix was vitally important to her child. Often in cases where there are 2 trustees, one may take a back seat but this does mean the law endorses the difference.

44     The testatrix had trusted both defendants to carry out the terms of her will. Each must therefore make decisions and if not, accept the decisions made by the co-executrix and trustee as his own. The sum of $87 498.24 was the sum derived at after deducting certain figures that could reasonably be supported. I did not impose any interest on the sum given that the facts of this case called for orders that reflected the unfortunate circumstance both defendants found themselves in today for having accepted responsibilities without fully appreciating the nature of the same. The punitive impact any interest would have was borne in mind. Similarly, no orders on costs were made.
