Family Law – Guardianship of Infants Act – best interest of child – custody care and control – access to child – supervised access – joint custody

21 May 2019

### District Judge Sheik Mustafa:

## Introduction

1       In this case the mother of a child commenced an originating summons for sole custody care and control of the child. The child will be 2 years old in June 2019. I heard both parties’ counsel, and ordered for both parents to have joint custody of the child, with the mother to have sole care and control. The father is to have access to the child as follows -

a.     supervised by the mother, every Saturday 3pm – 8 pm,

b.     unsupervised by the mother, every Saturday 3pm – 8 pm from 22 June 2019,

c.     unsupervised by the mother, every Saturday 10 am – 5 pm from 22 September 2019,

d.     unsupervised by the mother, every 24 December 10am – 8 pm,

e.     no order on access on the child’s birthday,

f.     no order on overnight access or overseas access, with parties granted liberty to apply after the child attains 3 years of age.

g.     liberty to apply generally.

2       Both the mother and the father have appealed against the judgment. I now give my reasons for it.

## Applicable Legal Principles

3       The primary law defining the care of children is found in section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act –

**“3**.    Where in any proceedings before any court the custody or upbringing of an infant or the administration of any property belonging to or held in trust for an infant or the application of the income thereof is in question, the court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration and save in so far as such welfare otherwise requires the father of an infant shall not be deemed to have any right superior to that of the mother in respect of such custody, administration or application nor shall the mother be deemed to have any claim superior to that of the father.”

4       The law defining custody of children is succinctly described by the Court of Appeal in the case of _CX v. CY_[^1], that –

“For the development of the law of custody, we deem it necessary to lay down a general definition detailing the scope of each order. Our observation is that in most custody cases, parties are simply concerned over which parent has care and control and access. Parties labour under the mistaken impression that if they are denied custody, they will be unable to see their child anymore and will lose all contact with the child. We regret to say that some family law practitioners further muddy the waters by failing to advise their clients adequately as to what “custody orders” actually entail. If parties are assured of their respective rights to care and control and access, we foresee lesser tension and acrimony in disputes over custody issues.

Adopting this narrow definition of “custody”, it appears that there will be relatively few occasions where significant and longer-term decisions need to be made for the child. Hence, parties will seldom need to come together to make a joint decision even if joint or no custody orders were granted. We should add that it is an almost impossible task for us to lay down an exhaustive list of matters which will fall under the concept of residual custody. The line is not always clear as to what matters would be considered the important and longer-term decisions concerning the upbringing and welfare of a child. It suffices to say that decisions pertaining to religion, education and major healthcare issues would fall into such a category.

In this day and age, we feel that the preferable position in the law of custody is that advocated by the father, ie, to preserve the concept of joint parental responsibility, even if the parties may harbour some acrimony towards each other. Often, advocates of the _Helen Ho_ position rely on the acrimonious relationship of the parties to argue that joint custody will be detrimental to the welfare of the child. However, they fail to appreciate the fact that some degree of acrimony is to be expected when parties are undergoing the stresses of a marital breakdown. As allegations of wrongdoings and breaches of fidelity can be hurtful, the time when the marriage breaks down may not be the best time to assess whether both parents can co-operate for the rest of the child’s life. We believe that the fear that parties cannot co-operate may be overstated. It is a quantum leap in logic to assume that the parties’ inability to co-operate during the period of divorce or custody proceedings equates to an inability to agree on the future long-term interests of the child.

…

Adopting the view that joint or no custody orders should be granted unless there are exceptional circumstances, we were of the opinion that the judge was not plainly wrong in granting joint custody, notwithstanding the allegations and counter-allegations made by each party.”

5       The Court of Appeal in _ZO v. ZP_[^2], the Court of Appeal added as follows:

“… The input by both parents furnishes a balance that enhances the development of that child (or those children, as the case may be) until adulthood is reached. In contrast, the exclusion of one of the parents in this particular regard would – absent an exceptional reason – contribute towards a less balanced as w ell as less rounded development of the child (or children) concerned. Hence, the pronouncement made by the court in CX v CY that a joint (or no) custody order would henceforth be the norm rather than the exception. We could not agree more.”

6       It was held in APE v APF[^3] by Justice Tan Siong Thye –

“ I am therefore of the view that unsupervised access should be awarded, unless the following exceptional circumstances are present:

(a)    there are serious welfare concerns regarding the non-custodial parent such as violence or inappropriate parenting if the child were left unattended with the non-custodial parent;

(b)    on an examination of the state of the relationship between the non-custodial parent and the child before the commencement of the divorce proceedings and after the commencement of the divorce proceedings, it is found that the child has been estranged from the non-custodial parent such that the parental-child relationship is in need of serious repair (for instance, if the child is fearful in meeting the non-custodial parent); or

(c)    factors exist such that it is difficult for unsupervised access to be effectively implemented (eg, where the relationship between both parents is so acrimonious that the custodial parent frustrates the effectiveness of unsupervised access orders and unsupervised access is not possible without detriment to the child).”

## Background Facts

7       Both parties filed affidavits, and I found the following facts, which provide the background of the case.

8       The mother is a Singaporean woman. She is now a supply chain executive. The father is an Australian man who now resides in Singapore on an employment pass. The couple were introduced on Tinder in Singapore in November 2015, and they dated. The father was at that time employed in Singapore. He returned to Australia in June 2016. The couple decided to, and planned get married in Australia in December 2016. However, in October 2016, the mother discovered that she was pregnant. Their plans changed, and the mother moved to Australia earlier than planned. They lived at the father’s mother’s residence in Sydney before moving into their own residence. The father paid the rent as the mother was not permitted to work in Australia.

9       They married on 29 December 2016. They resided in Sydney. On 1 June 2017, the child was born. The mother obtained a certificate of Singaporean citizenship for the child.

10     The relationship between the mother and the father deteriorated. Ultimately, on 10 January 2018, the mother left the matrimonial home. The mother claims that she was thrown out of home by the father, but this is disputed by the father. The father gave her a one-way ticket for a flight to Singapore with the child. The father also executed a statutory declaration stating that he granted sole custody care and control of the child to the mother. He gave the statutory declaration to the mother.

11     The mother returned to Singapore, with the child. She rented a room for herself and the child to live in. She received a monthly sum of A$1,800 from the father until April 2018. He claims that he stopped the payments as he had run out of money. The mother got a job in April 2018 earning S$3,700 which she relied upon to fully support herself and the child. The She enrolled the child in a childcare centre. In June 2018, she obtained a rental flat from HDB.

12     The mother claims that during this period of separation, she sent photographs and videos of the child to the father and his family. The parties occasionally video-called. In May 2018, the father came to Singapore and the mother arranged for him to have access to the child in her supervision.

13     On 25 August 2018, the father came to Singapore on an employment pass. He lives in a 2-bedroom condominium.

14     By then, the mother had filed the present originating summons. As the case progressed, the couple consented to the father having access to the child every Sunday from 5pm to 8pm. The mother had liberty to accompany the child. They agreed to an order for maintenance for the child. The remaining issues of custody, care and control were left for my judgment.

15     In essence, the mother objects to joint custody, to unsupervised access, and to overseas access. The father counters for joint custody, unsupervised access, and overseas access.

16     At the hearing, both parties were represented by counsel. The mother was legally aided.

## Disputed Facts

17     Beyond the foregoing, the parties’ versions diverge substantially on other facts, which I shall examine in greater detail.

18     The parties dispute on the circumstances leading to their separation. The mother allege that the father threw her and the child out of their home. The father denies this. He claims that the mother was ungracious to his family, that they frequently quarrelled, and that it was the mother herself who wished to return to Singapore. He did not wish to force her to stay, although the plan was for her to return to Australia subsequently, and so when he arranged the mother’s departure, he also arranged for her visa to allow her return. He contends that it was the mother who decided not to return to Australia.

19     There is a dispute regarding the purpose of the statutory declaration by the father purporting to give the mother sole custody, care and control of the child. The father claims that it was done in order to facilitate the child’s travel out of Australia with the mother, as at that time the child had not yet obtained Singaporean citizenship. He claims that the statutory declaration was the mother’s idea. He submits that it was in no way intended to waive his legal rights of custody of the child.

20     The father claims that he had come to Singapore to be closer to the child, but the mother has been making access difficult. He claims that the mother refuses to disclose her residential address and the location of the child’s childcare centre to him. He claims that in spite of an interim order regarding terms of access, the mother has been placing obstacles to prevent him from having meaningful access to the child. He claims that he made 3 trips to Singapore to see the child, but was only allowed to see him on 2 occasions.

21     The father does not challenge the mother having sole care and control of the child. He does, however, object to the mother having sole custody.

## Findings

22     I found that the parties do not have a good relationship. There is an evident breakdown of trust. The mother has disclosed neither her address nor the child’s child care centre’s address to the father. I found this passive gatekeeping behaviour to evidence an intent at retaining control of the child.

23     I found that the reasons why the mother left Australia is of little relevance to the issues regarding the child. On the issue of the effect of the statutory declaration, I accept that he executed it to facilitate the travel of the child. He did not exhibit any other conduct consistent with giving up custody of the child. Even if he had intended it to be so, it is the best interest of the child that must be my first and paramount consideration, and this means that the court is entitled to disregard such a statement if it is necessary to do so. Custody, care, control of and access to a child are rights of the child, not of the parents’, to seize, transfer, abdicate or abrogate. The Court has the ultimate role to decide and intervene, on behalf of the child, to determine and protect its best interest.

24     I rejected that the mother’s claim that the father will abduct the child if left unsupervised. There is no evidence to support this belief.

## Issues

25     Having stated the law and found the facts above, I examined the issues of the case –

a.     Should the mother be granted sole custody, care and control of the child?

b.     If so, what would be a suitable arrangement for the father to have access to the child?

c.     Should the father’s access to the child be supervised by the mother?

## Principles Applied and Judgment

26     Based on the foregoing findings, and applying the facts to the applicable principles of law, I found that the following.

27     There is no reason for the custody of the child to be granted solely to the mother to the exclusion of the father. Joint custody of a child of both parents is an inherent duty and a right imposed by virtue of law and accrued by virtue of biology, and ought not be removed unless good grounds are shown that not to do so would be against the best interest of the child. I found that there are no such grounds in this case. There is nothing exceptional in the circumstances of this case that warrants a departure from joint custody. Therefore, I ordered that the child is to remain in the joint custody of both parents. I found that to do so is in the best interest of the child.

28     I found that the mother ought to be ordered to have sole care and control of the child instead of the parties sharing it. The parties are living separately in different households, so they are physically living apart. The child is too young to live in two homes. The child has been continuously in the primary care of the mother since his birth. It is not in the child’s best interest to have his care and control split between his two parents who cannot get along with each other to the extent that even access arrangements are hotly contested. There is no indication that the mother has not been able to care and control the child adequately. In any event, this is not hotly contested by the father. Therefore, I ordered the child to be placed in the mother’s care and control solely. I found it to be in the child’s best interest and welfare for the status quo to persist.

29     Applying the reasoning of _BG v BF_, I found that the father ought to be given access to the child, beginning with the access being supervised by the mother and then to cease being supervised by her, and also with the periods of access being gradually increased. Thus, it is not for the father to justify his access to the child, rather it is for the mother to show exceptional circumstances justifying why access should be restricted or conditional. I found that the mother has not been able to show, on a balance of probabilities, that there are any exceptional circumstances. The conclusion is that the father ought to have unsupervised access to the child, once a week for 7 hours, but the change ought to be managed by gradually increasing the period of access, every 3 months, starting with 5 hours. The father had asked for access twice a week, with once on a weekend and once on a weekday. I found that it would be too abrupt a change for the child at such a young age to have access on a weekday as for now.

30     I found there to be no reason for the father to have his access to the child supervised by the mother. I found, on a balance of probabilities, that there is no serious welfare concern such as violence or inappropriate parenting if the child is left unattended by the mother. I also found that the relationship between the father and the child has not been so estranged that it is in need of serious repair. There is no evidence that the child is fearful of the father. I found that no factors exist to make it difficult for unsupervised access to be effectively implemented. Nevertheless, to ease the transition, and bearing in mind that, based on BG v BF, such an imposition is exceptional and ought to be in the child’s best interest, I also ordered the mother to supervise the access but for the first 3 months only, and then to hand off the child to the father for access without supervision. The supervision of access by the mother is necessary, and best for the child, because there has been an extended period of sole care by her, and it would make the transition to non-supervised access easier for the child.

31     The child is of young age, and I found that it is not suitable for him to travel without his mother to Australia, as of now. However, it is not desirable for this door to be closed, and I ordered that the matter can be reviewed if the parties apply to the Court after the child attains 3 years old.

32     The father requested for access on the child’s birthdays, on Father’s Days and Christmas, but I am of the view that it is not necessary nor desirable for the court to micro-manage access arrangements. In any event, Fathers’ Days fall on weekends when the father is to have access to the child anyway, so there is no need to make a specific order on it. As for the child’s birthdays, which is likely to fall on weekdays, I did not think it was necessary to complicate the parents’ transactions with each other any more than it already is. There is no foreseeable harm in the father celebrating the child’s birthdays on the weekends immediately before or after the day itself when he has access to the child. As for Christmas, I ordered the father to have access on Christmas eve instead.

33     I am mindful that the parents’ have an embittered relationship. There is likely to be no single arrangement regarding the child which would satiate both of them. My order is an attempt to draw a line for them as regards their relationship to their child, in the hope that whatever their spousal differences are, their parental roles vis-à-vis the child are now distinct, structured, settled and predictable. This, in my judgment, is the best thing for the child in the circumstances.
