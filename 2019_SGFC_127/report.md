Family Law – Ancillary Matters – maintenance; division of matrimonial assets; transfer of matrimonial flat

22 November 2019

### District Judge Christine Lee:

### Introduction

1       This is an appeal by the Defendant against the whole of the Court’s decision given on 8 August 2019 regarding cross applications by both the Plaintiff and the Defendant for variation of the Consent Order on the ancillary matters.

### Background Facts

2       The Plaintiff Wife (“the Plaintiff Wife”) and Defendant Husband (“the Defendant Husband”) married on xxx 1995 in Singapore. There are two (2) children from the marriage namely \[B\] (m) DOB xxx 2001 now aged 18 years and \[C\] (f) DOB xxx 2004 now aged about 15 years (“the said 2 children”). The marriage lasted about 23 years before the Plaintiff Wife filed Writ of Divorce on 16 August 2018.

3       Interim Judgement (“IJ”) was granted on 10 September 2018 based on the fact that the Plaintiff Wife had sufficiently proven the contents of the Statement of Claim and the marriage was dissolved by reason that the Defendant Husband had behaved in such a way that Plaintiff Wife cannot be reasonably expected to live with the Defendant Husband. CFRC Certificate was issued on 26 September 2018.

4       These being simplified proceedings, the IJ also contained a Consent Order dealing with all the ancillary matters (AMs) between the Parties. As such, Certificate of Final Judgement was issued on 12 December 2018.

5       On 15 January 2019, the Plaintiff Wife filed SUM xxx/2019 to seek a variation of Clauses 3(a)(b)(d) and (e) of the IJ dated 10 September 2018 regarding the said 2 children and disposal of the matrimonial home. However, this application was withdrawn on 28 March 2019 with costs of $800 payable to the Plaintiff Wife.

6       Subsequently, on 30 April 2019, the Plaintiff Wife filed SUM xxx/2019 to vary Clauses 3(b)(d) and (e) of the IJ dated 10 September 2018 also regarding the said 2 children and disposal of the matrimonial home.

7       On 22 May 2019, the Defendant Husband filed SUM xxx/2019 to rescind/revoke or set aside the whole of the AMs contained in the IJ dated 10 September 2018.

8       In **SUM xxx/2019**, the Plaintiff Wife’s application was for the following:

> Prayer 1:     Variation of Clause 3(b) of the Interim Judgment dated 10 September 2018 as follows:

> The Defendant \[Husband\] shall transfer (other than by way of sale) his share and interest in the matrimonial flat at xxx, ("the matrimonial flat") to the Plaintiff \[Wife\] absolutely with no CPF refunds to be made to the Defendant \[Husband\]'s CPF account(s) pursuant to Section 112 of the Women's Charter. The transfer shall be effected within 6 months from the date of this Order.

> Prayer 2:     Variation of Clause 3(d) of the Interim Judgment dated 10 September 2018 as follows:

> In consideration of the Defendant \[Husband\]'s agreement to the terms set out in this Consent Order of Court, the Plaintiff \[Wife\] shall pay a sum of $100,000.00 to the Defendant Husband, being the Defendant \[Husband\]'s share of matrimonial assets as follows:

>> (i)    a sum of $34,434.05 which the Defendant \[Husband\] has already received from the Plaintiff \[Wife\]; and

>> (ii)   the balance sum of $65,565.95 shall be paid on the completion of the transfer of the matrimonial flat.

> Prayer 3:     Variation of Clause 3(e) of the Interim Judgment dated 10 September 2018 as follows:

> The Plaintiff \[Wife\] shall maintain the Children, and there shall be no maintenance for the Plaintiff \[Wife\].

> Prayer 4:     Any other order(s) which this Honourable Court deems necessary.

9       In **SUM xxx/2019**, the Defendant \[Husband\] applied for the following orders:

> Prayer 1: To rescind and/or revoke and/or set-aside the Interim Judgment dated 10 September 2018 relating to the ancillary matters;

> Prayer 2: Cost of the application herein; and

> Prayer 3: Such further or other order(s) as the Honourable Court deems fit to make.

### Hearings before the Court

10     The Court first dealt with the Defendant Husband’s application in SUM xxx/2019 as the Court was of the view that the outcome of that application would affect the Plaintiff Wife’s application in SUM xxx/2019.

11     The Court then proceeded to hear submissions on the Plaintiff Wife’s application in SUM xxx/2019 and delivered its decision on both summons applications on the same day.

12     The Defendant Husband filed Notice of Appeal on 22 August 2019 in HCF/DCA 96/2019 against the whole of the Court’s decision made on 8 August 2019 (“the said Court Order”).

### Summary of the Court’s reasons for making its Order

14     This case involved the variation of a Consent Order which was issued at the time of the Interim Judgement dated 10 September 2018 (“IJ Consent Order dated 10 September 2018”). The crux of the two summons applications by both Parties was the issue of the payment of the sum of $100,000.00 by the Plaintiff Wife to the Defendant Husband. This arises out of Clause 3(d) of the IJ Consent Order dated 10 September 2018 which provides as follows:

> _In consideration of the Defendant \[Husband\]'s agreement to the terms as set out in this Consent Order of Court, the Plaintiff \[Wife\] shall pay the sum of $100,000.00 to the Defendant \[Husband\], being the Defendant \[Husband\]'s share of matrimonial assets, on the date that the Defendant \[Husband\] signs the simplified divorce documents._

15     The Court was informed that the Defendant Husband had only consented to the IJ Consent Order dated 10 September 2018 because of the Plaintiff Wife’s misrepresentation to him at the time the Parties were negotiating the draft Consent Order, that she was able to pay the sum of $100,000.00 to him on the date the Defendant Husband signed the simplified divorce documents.

16     The Defendant Husband’s Counsel submitted that the Plaintiff Wife’s failure to disclose her lack of financial capacity to pay this sum of $100,000.00, was an undue influence on the Defendant Husband because he was facing duress that he was likely to lose his job if he was not able to pay up his credit card and credit loan debts in the sum of about $82,000 as told to him by his superiors[^1].

17     However, the Court noted that at para 43 of his own Affidavit[^2], the Defendant Husband had said that the Plaintiff Wife told him that she would borrow money to give the Defendant Husband this sum of $100,000.00. The Court pointed out to the Defendant Husband’s Counsel that the Plaintiff Wife did not say that she had the money and that there was a difference between having the capacity to pay and an agreement to pay by borrowing the money to do so.

18     In response, the Defendant Husband’s Counsel submitted that the Plaintiff Wife had agreed to pay this money to the Defendant Husband and so the Plaintiff Wife was saying that she had the capacity to pay[^3].

19     The Defendant Husband’s Counsel further submitted that although the Plaintiff Wife was relying on paragraph 5 of D3[^4] where the Defendant Husband said that he knew that the Plaintiff Wife did not have this sum of $100,000.00, that this was in the context of how it came about when the Plaintiff Wife suggested the payment of the sum of $100,000.00 to the Defendant Husband. The Defendant Husband’s Counsel submitted that the fundamental misrepresentation by the Plaintiff Wife was that she never had the money in the first place so her intention was to secure the property and then get the money later. Thus the Defendant Husband signed the draft Consent Order based on the condition that the Plaintiff Wife would pay him the money.

20     The Court disagreed with this argument. The Court agreed with the Plaintiff Wife’s Counsel’s submission that the Defendant Husband knew that the Plaintiff Wife did not have the financial capacity to pay and that she would have to borrow the money. The Court further agreed with the Plaintiff Wife’s Counsel that it was clear that both Parties knew what their financial circumstances were. The Defendant Husband was well aware that the Plaintiff Wife had not worked during most of their marriage and had only started working in February 2017. It was not challenged by the Defendant Husband that the Plaintiff Wife did not make much money and that her take home salary was about $2,000.00 per month.

21     Accordingly, the Court found that there was no fundamental misrepresentation by the Plaintiff Wife that she had the money in the first place and that the Defendant Husband knew very well, which he repeated in his own Affidavits, that the Plaintiff Wife would have to borrow the money to pay him the sum of $100,000.00.

22     The Defendant Husband’s Counsel then submitted that when the Defendant Husband subsequently refused to sign the papers for the transfer of the matrimonial flat, the Plaintiff Wife could have gotten the Registrar to execute this transfer under the empowering clause in Clause 3(c) but she did not. Instead, the Plaintiff Wife went into negotiations with the Defendant Husband to vary the IJ Consent Order dated 10 September 2018 by filing SUM xxx/2019 in January 2019. The Defendant Husband’s Counsel submitted that this showed that the Plaintiff Wife felt some guilt on her part and that she should give some leeway to the Defendant Husband to renegotiate as she had taken advantage of him regarding the draft Consent Order.

23     The Court found that this argument was flawed and based on conjecture. The Court did not believe that there were no options available to the Defendant Husband when he signed the draft Consent Order on 14 August 2018 and the Plaintiff Wife only paid him the sum of $32,684.05[^5] instead of the sum of $100,000.00 at the time of signing. The records showed that the simplified divorce proceedings documents were filed on 16 August 2018 and that the Defendant Husband did not withdraw his consent to these simplified divorce proceedings, nor did he appeal against the IJ Consent Order when it was issued on 10 September 2018.

24     The Defendant Husband only filed his application in SUM xxx/2018 on 22 May 2019 to rescind/revoke or set aside the whole of the orders made in the IJ Consent Order dated 10 September 2018. The Court was of the view that this was an attempt by the Defendant Husband to use his application in SUM xxx/2018 as a back-door appeal.

25     The Court also took into account two cases on the issue of Consent Orders. The first case was **AYM vs AYL <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGCA 46</span>** where the Court of Appeal (CA) said that for variation of a Consent Order, the Applicant must prove that there has been a material change in circumstances i.e. those circumstances prevailing at the time the Consent Order was made.

26     The second case was **UMM vs UML <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHCF 13</span>** where the principles enunciated in AYM vs AYL were elaborated in that the Court’s power to set aside or vary a Consent Order on ancillary matters is to be exercised narrowly. The Applicant must prove one of the vitiating factors or that it has become unworkable. The unworkability must be a fundamental misunderstanding on the face of the Order ie it must be with regard to the Order at the time it was made.

27     In that case it was also noted by the learned Justice Debbie Ong that it is a serious matter for one to sign a legal document before a Commissioner of Oaths or before a lawyer. The Court noted that at paragraph 16 of the case, it was stated that a variation necessitated by the Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board’s objection to the terms of the Court Order, is a factor which shows that the Court Order is unworkable.

28     In the present case, the Court noted that the Defendant Husband not only signed the draft Consent Order before a Commissioner for Oaths but he also signed his three Affidavits for the two summons applications before Commissioners for Oaths. In these Affidavits, the Defendant Husband confirmed that the Plaintiff Wife told him that she would have to borrow money to pay him the sum of $100,000.00.

29     As the Court did not believe that the Defendant Husband was misrepresented by the Plaintiff Wife as to her financial capacity for the payment of the sum of $100,000.00, the Court dismissed the Defendant Husband’s application in SUM xxx/2019.

30     With regard to the Plaintiff Wife’s application in SUM xxx/2019, the Court was of the view that there were sufficient grounds to vary the IJ Consent Order dated 10 September 2018. Firstly, the Consent Order was now not workable because the time frame for the completion of the transfer had long expired. Secondly, the CPF Board required some changes to be made to the Court Order before the Board would agree to the transfer. Accordingly, the Court granted the Plaintiff Wife’s requests as amended, following the submissions by Counsel on the final Order required[^6].

31     The Court found that the Plaintiff Wife’s proposal for the payment of the balance of the sum of $100,000.00 to the Defendant Husband was fair and reasonable and granted it. However, the Plaintiff Wife sought six months for the transfer of the matrimonial flat by the Defendant Husband. Since the payment of the balance sum to the Defendant Husband was tied to this transfer, the Court shortened the time period for the transfer to be effected within four months from the date of the Order.

32     As the Plaintiff Wife had succeeded in most of her requests in her summons application and the Defendant Husband’s summons application was wholly dismissed, the Court ordered costs of $1,500.00 to be paid by the Defendant Husband to the Plaintiff Wife.
