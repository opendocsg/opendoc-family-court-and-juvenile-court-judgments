Family law – Family violence – Orders for protection

Family law – Family violence – Orders for counselling – Making of order for counselling without making of order for protection under s 26(9) Family Justice Act 2014 (No 27 of 2014)

Family procedure – Gag orders

3 March 2021

### Magistrate Patrick Tay Wei Sheng:

1       A 23-year-old sister (“P”) seeks a personal protection order (“PPO”) against her 21-year-old brother (“D”) based on an act of family violence allegedly committed in the family home, which was a yacht (the “Incident”). P claims that D had, at the material time, grabbed her by the throat and thrown her down. She adds that she has since moved out of the yacht and into an apartment owned by the family. She states that she wishes to return to live with the family but fears for her safety around D because of the Incident and a history of physical violence by D against her.

2       D denies grabbing P by the neck and throwing her down but admits to pushing her at the material time. D maintains that he had simply been reacting after P had provoked him. D also complains that P has been harassing him by publishing details about these PPO proceedings on her social media accounts and encouraging their mutual friends to dissociate themselves from him.

3       P calls her boyfriend (“H”) as a witness in support of her claims. D calls as his witnesses his parents (respectively the “Father” and the “Mother” and collectively the “Parents”) and his other sister (“A”).

4       As Debbie Ong J observed in _UNQ v UNR_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHCF 21</span> (“_UNQ_”) at \[22\]–\[24\], family violence is unacceptable, and the court will take a firm stand against it. Family violence may be found in a variety of circumstances, as set out in s 64 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (the “Charter”). Acts of physical abuse of a family member are family violence if they were intended or known or ought to have been known to produce hurt (see s 64(b) of the Charter). Acts short of physical abuse that place or attempt to place a family member in fear of hurt are also family violence if they were committed wilfully or knowingly (see s 64(a) of the Charter). But not every instance of family violence will warrant a PPO. Only if a PPO is necessary to protect the family member will it be granted (see s 65(1) of the Charter).

## Family violence

5       I find that the Incident discloses family violence by D against P, even if there is some disagreement as to how it unfolded. Nevertheless, because parties canvassed the events of the Incident in detail in their written statements and oral evidence, I will examine it briefly.

6       P testifies that D had grabbed her by the neck and had thrown her into a chair. D insists that he had simply pushed P away from himself without grabbing P by the neck. But D accepts that he may have, due to his significant height advantage over P, touched her neck. D adds that he had been reacting to provocation by D, who had deliberately knocked over his snacks. Contemporaneous video footage from a CCTV on the yacht shows P knocking over the snacks but is inconclusive as to any contact between P and D thereafter.

7       The Parents, who had been at the scene of the Incident and who had moved to separate P and D in its wake, both testify that D had not grabbed P by the neck but had pushed P between her chest and her head. The Mother adds that any force used by D had been minimal, and that P had fallen only because P had been taken by surprise by the push. The Mother also appears to suggest that the deck of the yacht on which P had been standing had not been completely stable because the yacht had been bobbing in the sea.

8       H and A were not at the scene of the Incident. They simply repeat what P and D respectively had told each of them about it. But oral evidence must in all cases whatever be direct: “if it refers to a fact which could be seen \[or perceived\], it must be the evidence of a witness who says he saw \[or perceived\] that fact (s 62(1) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (the “EA”)). This constrains me to reject their evidence.

9       P exhibits an electronic message from D from five days after the Incident in which D “apologise\[d\] for grabbing you by the throat”. D responds that he had been directed by his Parents to apologise based on how P had perceived the Incident. D explains that he had in a subsequent message, after P had complained to the Parents that this apology was insufficiently sincere, added a further “apolog\[y\] for pushing you and causing you to fall”, because that was how he had perceived the Incident. The Mother confirms that she had told D to apologise for what P had perceived during the Incident and adds that “if anyone is to be blamed for the \[confusion\], it is me” because she had simply been trying to get P and D to move on from the Incident.

10     Ultimately, it is immaterial whether D had grabbed or pushed P. Even if P had not grabbed D by the neck, he had pushed her in or around the neck with some force. Given his significant height advantage over her, he must have appreciated that a push in the neck, which is a vulnerable part of the body, could cause her bodily pain. Even if P had provoked D by knocking over his snacks, such a push is hardly a proportionate response. I thus find family violence within s 64(a) of the Charter established. In reaching this conclusion, I do not accept the evidence of the Mother that P had been taken by surprise by the push. D did not take any such position in his testimony. Nor did the Father corroborate this evidence.

11     Thankfully, any pain suffered by P from the push and the ensuing fall was transient. The CCTV footage shows P getting to her feet almost immediately thereafter then gesticulating at and exchanging words with D and the Parents.

12     Having found that D committed family violence against P, what remains is the necessity of a PPO.

## Protection

13     I find that a PPO is not necessary for the protection of P for three reasons.

14     First, D has recognized his wrongdoing and has taken steps to put it right and ensure that he will not repeat it. He has unreservedly apologized to P on two occasions: initially based on P’s account of the events and subsequently based on his own account of the events (see \[9\] above). He has also participated in counselling with a private specialist to gain an insight into the behaviour that led to the Incident. Although the report produced by the specialist is inadmissible hearsay evidence because the specialist has not been called as a witness in these proceedings (see s 32 of the EA), it is not in dispute that D has underwent such counselling. And even if P had offered the apologies and participated in the counselling at the prompting of the Parents, there is no suggestion that D did not participate in the counselling.

15     Second, the family has taken steps to minimise the risk of further family violence between P and D. It found alternative accommodation for P (see \[1\] above) immediately after the Incident. It has also closely supervised P and D in family gatherings since the Incident. All three family gatherings involving P and D that have taken place since the Incident proceeded uneventfully.

16     Third, P has been living apart from D in the wake of the Incident, and D has not sought to meet or otherwise engage P. Rather, it is P who appears to have sought to engage D by publishing details of these proceedings on her social media accounts and encouraging their mutual friends to dissociate themselves from D. And P does not deny having made such publications.

17     For completeness, there is some evidence of past scuffles between P and D as well as with the other members of the family. Insofar as P relies on these scuffles to show a history of or a propensity for family violence on the part of D, the Parents have given unchallenged evidence that these scuffles were nothing more than unexceptional tiffs between family members. It is also not disputed by P that she was the aggressor in some of these scuffles (including once where she had thrown a package at the Father that had cut his hand) and that the family members involved had reconciled soon after. I thus place little weight on these scuffles.

18     I thus conclude that there is thus little risk of family violence by D on P in the foreseeable future, and that a PPO is unnecessary for the protection of P.

## Restoration

19     No family is perfect, and it would be an unusual family that does not experience conflict. Resorting to violence to resolve such conflicts is unacceptable, but more important than apportioning blame after such incidents is finding a sustainable way forward for the parties and preserving the familial relationship. As the Court of Appeal stated in _VDZ v VEA_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 2 SLR 858</span> at \[77\], “relationships constitute the very pith and marrow of a family … Damage \[to these relationships\] cannot be repaired … by way of material recompense; _healing_ needs to take place.” Yet some shared interests will persist even amidst familial disharmony, and these shared interests can illuminate a way forward for alleviating the broken human relationships and resolving the conflict (see Sundaresh Menon CJ, “From Family Law to Family Justice”, Keynote Address, The Law Society Family Conference 2020 (14 September 2020) at para 35).

20     Here, the parties and their Parents share a desire for the family to be re-united even if they differ over how this desire should be realised. The Parents long for P and D to reconcile and for P to return to living with them. The Mother testifies that she fell into depression after P moved out and that she constantly worries for P (who has had to live alone) and for D (who has had to live under the expedited order that has been granted in these proceedings pursuant to s 66 of the Charter). The Father laments that he cannot wait to see P and D reconcile just as the family had reconciled in the past following squabbles and scuffles (see \[17\] above). P and D accept that such reconciliation would be ideal even as P insists that she needs a PPO to feel safe.

21     Unlike the typical relationships that underlie a civil or criminal dispute, the relationship between P and D (and their Parents) – the familial relationship – will continue even after these proceedings are concluded. D will remain P’s brother. P will remain D’s sister. And P and D will remain children of the Parents, who love them dearly. I thus urge P and D to work to repair their relationship.

22     To facilitate this process of repair, I exercise my power in the Family Justice Act 2014 (No 27 of 2014) (the “FJA”) to order both P and D to undergo counselling so that they can receive therapeutic assistance. Even if s 65(5)(b) of the Charter, which empowers the court to make a counselling order upon the making of a PPO, does not apply here because no PPO has been made, the Family Court retains a broad power under s 26(9) of the FJA to order any party before it to undergo counselling. Moreover, the Family Court may exercise this power on its own motion. I set out s 26(9) of the FJA:

> **Jurisdiction of Family Courts**

> **26**.—

> (9)    Subject to any other written law, a Family Court may, either on its own motion or on the application of any person, order any party to any proceedings in a Family Court, or any child who is a subject of such proceedings, to undergo such mediation or counselling, or to participate in such family support programme or activity, as the Family Court may direct.

23     The powers of the Family Court under s 26(9) of the FJA are “subject to any other written law”. But I do not think that s 65(5)(b) of the Charter, which allows for the making of a counselling order where a PPO has been granted, precludes the making of a counselling order where a PPO has not been granted. This is at least where the counselling is focused not only on addressing the behaviours that underlie the family violence but also on helping the parties resolve their conflict and repair their familial relationship. Such therapeutic “helping \[of\] the family” is the purpose of s 26(9) of the FJA, as observed by the Committee for Family Justice, whose recommendations motivated the enactment of the FJA (see _Recommendations of the Committee for Family Justice on the framework of the family justice system_ (4 July 2014) at para 149). To that extent, a counselling order under s 26(9) of the FJA serves a function different from that under s 65(5)(b) of the Charter, and the two regimes can co-exist.

24     Similarly, in _UNQ_, Ong J had, after setting aside a PPO, directed the Counselling and Psychological Services (“CAPS”) team at the Family Justice Courts to follow up with the family involved to provide therapeutic assistance (_UNQ_ at \[45\]).

> For the reasons stated above, I allowed the Father’s appeal and set aside the PPO. I directed the Family Justice Courts’ Counselling and Psychological Services to follow up with Family Conferences for this family, to provide some therapeutic assistance.

25     The power of the family court to order counselling on its own motion under s 26(9) of the FJA was also invoked by Chia Wee Kiat DJ in _VGR v VGS_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGFC 27</span> following ancillary proceedings in a divorce.

26     Here, the Parents themselves recognise the value of the therapeutic assistance provided by counselling. They sent D for counselling after the Incident. Before me, they even suggest that the whole family should undergo counselling on their relationships.

27     I thus order P and D to undergo counselling, which the CAPS team will facilitate, pursuant to s 26(9) of the FJA.

## Publication

28     D complains that P has been publishing details about these PPO proceedings on her social media accounts and encouraging their mutual friends to dissociate themselves from him. The Parents add that these publications have distressed them greatly.

29     My decision above leaves no need for me to consider the issues of any such publications by P in these proceedings or of whether P has thus been harassing D. Still, I pause to observe that unless otherwise ordered, “all matters and proceedings in a Family Justice Court shall be heard _in camera_” (s 10(1) of the FJA). These proceedings should thus be kept confidential.

30     For the avoidance of doubt, I issue a gag order pursuant to s 10(4) of the FJA to prohibit the publication of any thing or the doing of any act that is likely to lead to the identification of any witness in these proceedings.

31     As for any publication that has been made, it is for the parties affected to seek legal advice on their options.

## Costs

32     I make no order on the costs of these proceedings.
