Division of Matrimonial Property

20 April 2020

### District Judge Goh Zhuo Neng:

## A.   INTRODUCTION

1       This was an ancillary matters hearing. The Plaintiff Mother (“**Mother**”) and Defendant Father (“**Father**”) were represented by counsel. After hearing parties and considering their submissions, I ordered that there be no maintenance for the Plaintiff, and made orders on the division of matrimonial property which are broadly set out below (“**Division Orders**”).

> a)     That the matrimonial property at Apt Blk xxx Singapore xxx ("matrimonial home") be sold in the open market within 6 (six) months from the date of the Final Judgment and the sale proceeds after deducting the outstanding mortgage loan and costs and expenses of the sale, are to be divided 77.6% to the Plaintiff and 22.4% to the Defendant. Parties to refund to their respective CPF account of all monies utilised towards the purchase of the matrimonial home and accrued interest thereon from their own share of the sale proceeds. Parties are to have joint conduct of the sale of the matrimonial home.

> b)     That with effect from the date of this Order, payment of the outstanding mortgage loan, property tax, insurance payments, conservancy, town council charges & all other expenses for the matrimonial home are to be borne between parties in the proportions of 77.6% by the Plaintiff and 22.4% by the Defendant.

> c)     Parties shall retain all other respective matrimonial assets (aside from the matrimonial home) held in his/her sole name.

2       Orders on custody care and control, access and maintenance of the two Children of the family had already been made by consent prior to this hearing. On 20 January 2020, the Father filed his Notice of Appeal against the Division Orders. The Mother has not appealed against my decision. I set out below the full grounds of my decision.

## B.   BACKGROUND

3       The parties were married on 10 October 2000. The writ of divorce was filed on 5 June 2018. Interim Judgement was made on 14 November 2018, making this an 18 year marriage.

4       Parties had 2 children who turned 15 and 16 in 2020. The Mother was currently working odd-jobs, and the Father had recently worked as a sale representative but was currently unemployed.

## C.   DIVISION OF MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY

#### I.    _The Law_

5       Here, I applied the structured approach as stated in the Court of Appeal decision in _ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span>, \[23\] :

> a)     Step 1 - Express as a ratio the parties’ direct contributions relative to each other, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets.

> b)     Step 2 - Express as a second ratio the parties’ indirect contributions relative to each other, having regard to both financial and non-financial contributions.

> c)     Step 3 - Derive the parties’ overall contributions relative to each other by taking an average of the two ratios above (the derived ratio shall be referred to as “the average ratio”).

6       If the same weight is given to both direct and indirection contributions, the average ratio derived in Step 3 need not be adjusted (_ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span>, \[37\]). However, depending on the circumstances of each case, the direct and indirect contributions may not be accorded equal weight under Step 3, and one of the two ratios in Step 1 and 2 may be accorded more significance than the other. Adjustments can also be made in respect of other relevant factors under s 112 or 114(1) of the Women’s Charter (_ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span>. \[28\])

#### II.    Value of Matrimonial Assets

7       The assets of the parties and my valuation of these assets are set out in **Annex A**. They were valued at a total of $484,909.40. With regard to the valuation of the assets, I generally adopted (unless agreed), the most recent valuations as the value of the matrimonial assets should be assessed as at the date of the hearing of ancillary matters (_Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo Nancy_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 2 SLR 1157</span>).

## D.   DIVISION OF MATRIMONIAL ASSETS – DIRECT FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS

## I.   Overview

8       The bulk of the parties’ assets were vested in the matrimonial home. There were also assets and the proceeds of assets which required some degree of tracing and rough approximation given the lack of documentary evidence in some areas.

## II.   Matrimonial Home - Valuation

9       Parties held the matrimonial home – a Housing Development Board flat - in joint names. I adopted the value of $296,000.00 submitted by the Father as this was the only valuation submitted by the parties of a unit within the same floor range. Deducting the outstanding loan of $57,836.19 which was confirmed by both counsel at the hearing, I attributed a nett value of $238,163.81 to the matrimonial home.

## III.   Matrimonial Home – Contributions

10     Parties agreed on the amount of contributions from their Central Provident Funds (“**CPF**”) to the acquisition of the matrimonial home. In respect of their cash contributions, there was a dispute. The parties agreed that cash repayments for the housing loan amounted to $95,719.00 and came from the Father’s bank account. However, the Mother claimed some of this contribution as she had deposited monies into the Father’s account when he was incarcerated. There was no proof of that such deposits were made, so I attributed the cash repayment for the housing loan fully to the Father.

11     Parties also claimed that they had done various renovations to the matrimonial home. Examples cited included were superficial renovations for tiling, kitchen work and installation of cabinets. However there was insufficient proof that these renovations had significantly increased the value of the home or altered its character. I attributed no value to these renovation contributions. They were indirect financial contributions at best. Contributions to the acquisition of furniture were also treated similarly.

12     Parties also claimed contribution to agent fees and the deposit in the acquisition of the matrimonial home. There was no documentary proof of such payments being made, beyond what was already set out in their CPF statements.

13     Accordingly, I attributed the direct contributions to the matrimonial home in a 87.16: 12.84 ratio in favour of the Father.

14     Based on the net value of the matrimonial home ($238,163.81), this would give parties direct contributions from the matrimonial home of $207,583.58 (Father) and $30,580.23 (Mother) respectively.

## IV.   Motor Vehicles

15     During the recent course of the marriage, the parties also had use of motor vehicles were owned in the Father’s sole name. The issue here was whether the Mother was able to establish her alleged contributions to acquire these vehicles, and what had happened to the proceeds of these vehicles.

#### Toyota Estima

16     The Mother had a Toyota Estima for her own use. This vehicle was acquired in 2012 and was sold in June 2018. She claimed that she had paid a downpayment of $15,000.00 and $20,000.00 for the car instalments. There was simply no documentary proof of this. On the other hand, the hire purchase for the car was signed by the Father as the hirer and the obligation to repay it placed in the Father’s name. Therefore I attributed full contribution for the proceeds of the Toyota Estima to the Father.

17     The Father claimed that the proceeds of the Toyota Estima amounted to $18,383.00 and that they had been frozen by the police. This was a likely story given that the Father was not even able to give the date on which the account was frozen. It was more likely that the Father had withdrawn these amounts himself. Bank statements show that the sum of $18,383.00 was deposited in the Father’s POSB Bank Account No.xxx (“**Father’s POSB Account**”) on 18 June 2018. By 26 June 2018, the bulk of these monies had been withdrawn, with a withdrawal of $18,000.00 in cash from an ATM at Yishun Central on 26 June 2018.

18     Therefore I added the sum of $18,383.00 back into the pool of matrimonial assets.

#### Mitsubishi Lancer/Audi Q5

19     The Father had sold a Mitsubishi Lancer (“**Lancer**”) and used the proceeds to purchase an Audi Q5 (“**Audi**”). Both vehicles were owned in his name. It was not disputed that the Lancer had been sold for $5,514.00 and that the Audi was currently valued at $10,641.00, and that the Father had contributed fully to them. Therefore I attributed full contribution for the proceeds of the Lancer and the value of the Audi to the Father.

20     However there was the issue of whether the proceeds of the Lancer should be included in the value of the Audi, or added to the pool of assets. The Father claimed that the proceeds of the Lancer had been used to acquire the Audi. This was less believable, as the proceeds of the Lancer had been deposited into the Father’s UOB Account No.xxx (“**Father’s UOB Account**”) on 25 July 2018 – one day after the Father had purchased the Audi on 24 July 2018. So they could not have been utilised for the payment of the Audi’s deposit. These proceeds were unlikely to have been utilised for the instalments of the Audi as they were also all withdrawn as cash by 29 July 2018.

21     Therefore I added the sums of $5,514.00 (Lancer) and $10,641.00 (Audi) back into the pool of matrimonial assets.

## V.   Pawned Jewellery

22     The Father confirmed that he had pawned certain items belonging to him after the interim judgement was granted. Copies of the pawn tickets were provided by the Father expressing the value of the following items.

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="49.56%"> <col width="50.44%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Item and date of pawning</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Pawned value</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Gold Chain pawned 7 February 2019</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$15,000.00</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Rolex pawned 8 April 2019</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$15,000.00</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Rolex pawned 21 May 2019</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$6,000.00</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Rolex pawned 21 May 2019</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$2,500.00</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Rolex pawned 28 May 2019</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$12,000.00</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

23     The Father claimed that he had to pawn them to repay his debts. I found that these items comprised matrimonial assets and while the Father was free to use them and their proceeds as he wished, an accounting had to be taken of them. Therefore I added them back into the matrimonial proceeds and attributed the direct contribution of these items to him in full.

## VI.   Father’s 4D Winnings

24     The Father had won $200,000.00 in the 4D lottery and received these winnings in January 2017. The Mother claimed that part of these winnings amounting to $175,000.00 should be returned to the pool. As stated in the case of _BOI v BOJ_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 2 SLR 114</span>, lottery winnings constitute matrimonial assets for division and there is a presumption that both spouses will have an equal direct contribution from the winnings unless the party who purchased the winning ticket can show that it was purchased with the intention of benefitting that party solely \[28\].

25     In my view, it was not possible for the Father to show that he intended to benefit himself solely. In his Notice of Response to Request for Interrogatories filed on 4 June 2019, he states at his response to request no. 17 (“**Response**”) that the lottery winnings of $200,000.00 were utilised as follows:

> _“…_

> (_a_)     _$50,000/- was given to the Plaintiff upon her request._

> (_b_)     _$30,000/- was given to the Plaintiff to purchase a watch; however to the Defendant’s knowledge, the Plaintiff had gambled the full sum away._

> (_c_)     _$25,000/- was utilized by the Defendant to purchase a gold chain; and_

> (_d_)     _The Defendant had kept the remaining $95,000/-; however he will not be able to provide exact details as this is part of past and current criminal investigations against him.”_

26     In his own words, the Father’s alleged conduct of the 4D winnings indicate that there was no intention to solely benefit himself by purchasing the winning 4D ticket. Therefore the presumption that both parties will share an equal contribution to the 4D winnings is not unrebutted.

27     How much of the 4D winnings should be added back into the pool? It would not be fair in my view to add back the full amount. These winnings entered the matrimonial pool some 1.5 years before the writ for divorce was filed by the Mother. They would undoubtedly have been used and shared by both parties, therefore I accepted the Father’s explanations in respect of the use of the 4D winnings under subparagraphs (a) to (c) in the Response.

28     However, the Father’s explanation in subparagraph (d) of the Response in respect of the sum of $95,000.00 was unacceptable to me.

29     I could not understand why the use of monies which were legitimately won, could be cloaked by what the Father perceived as a right not to incriminate himself. He simply did not want to disclose what had become of these proceeds. Taking into account the possibility that these proceeds (of about $95,000.00) could also have been used for the household and family’s expenses, I attributed a 50% discount to the amount and added the sum of $47,500.00 back into the matrimonial pool with a direct contribution of $23,750.00 to each party.

## VII.   Withdrawals

30     The Mother submitted that certain of the withdrawals made by the Father after the proceedings had been commenced in 5 June 2018 should be returned to the pool. The reason for this was because the explanation given was that the monies were used for the repayment of a loan. Of these withdrawals, which spanned from August 2018 to November 2018, the only one which I returned to the pool was a withdrawal of $1,000.00 dated 1 August 2018. In my view, this was sufficiently proximate to the filing date of June 2018 as it was within the 3 month period inclusive of the filing date. To go beyond that period might extend the matrimonial pool to assets that had been acquired by the Father after the filing of the writ e.g. his salary. I attributed the full contribution of $1,000.00 to the Father.

## E.   DIVISION OF MATRIMONIAL ASSETS – INDIRECT CONTRIBUTIONS

31     Both parties claimed to be the sole breadwinner. The Mother claimed she worked various jobs throughout the marriage up till 2015, and had lent monies to the Father throughout the marriage. She also claimed to have managed the household and cooked for the children. She also claimed to have been responsible for enrolling the children in school. The Father was painted as a neglectful parent who spent time in jail regularly and was a negative influence on the children. She asked to be awarded 80% of the indirect contributions.

32     The Father in turn claimed that the Mother was a negative influence on the children, citing examples of the children’s disciplinary problems. He submitted she was a gambler who had to be constantly bailed out by him and claimed he lavished her with money for the household expenses as well as her endeavours into business. While he admitted having to go to jail for periods spanning a few weeks and months in 2001, 2008 and 2014, he claimed to always have provided for the family by leaving cash with the Mother. The Father also claimed to have spent regular time with the children as a family on the weekend, as well as taking them to the doctor when they were ill and helping them with their school work. He asked to be awarded 65% of the indirect contributions.

33     On the evidence, the Father was more likely to be the breadwinner. The Mother failed to provide a single income tax document through the entire period she claimed to be employed. The Father was not much better. However he did provide a recent income tax document indicating that in the financial year dated 2018, he earned an annual income of about $56,000.00.

34     If the Father was the breadwinner, then the Mother was more likely to have been the one who was responsible for taking care of the children and household. This is also supported by his claim that he provided the Mother with monthly sums to cover the household expenses. She was clearly the party who had responsibility for organising the household. I accept that the Father also made contributions by spending time with the children, so on balance I awarded the Mother 70% of the indirect contributions.

## F.   DIVISION OF MATRIMONIAL ASSETS – ADVERSE INFERENCES

35     In his submissions, the Father stated that the Mother had failed to provide disclosure of:

> a)     UOB Bank Account No. xxx and DBS Bank Account No. xxx.

> b)     Luxury Items in the Mother’s Possession which were allegedly worth $99,000.00.

> c)     The reasons for Mother’s depletion of her bank accounts prior to the filing of the divorce proceedings and what had become of these monies.

36     In this regard, the Father asked that an adverse inference be drawn against the Mother. I decided not to draw an adverse inference against the Mother for the following reasons.

> a)     UOB/DBS Bank statements - The UOB and DBS Bank accounts disclosed were sufficient, as they covered the period from March 2018 up till the filing of the writ in June 2018.

> b)     Luxury Items – The Father had not provided any proof that these items existed. The allegation was only raised in his 2nd Ancillary Matters Affidavit without giving the Mother an opportunity to reply.

> c)     Reasons for Depletion – In my view, both parties had failed to provide a clear explanation of the reasons for depletion of the monies in their bank accounts prior to the writ. The Father’s bank statements preceding the filing of the writ in June 2018 indicated a high volume of transactions and withdrawals which were inexplicable for a sale representative – amounting to some $50,000.00 to $60,000.00 per month. There was no need to draw an adverse inference against one party in particular.

## G.   DIVISION OF MATRIMONIAL ASSETS – APPLYING THE RATIO AND DIVISION OF ASSETS

37     Applying the ratios under the structured approach, the ratios awarded to each party is as set out below.

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="32.64%"> <col width="33.68%"> <col width="33.68%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Father</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Mother</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Direct Contribution</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">83.8%</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">16.2%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Indirect Contribution</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">30%</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">70%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Average Ratio</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">56.9% ($275,913.45)</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">43.1% ($208,995.95)</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

38     Accordingly, the matrimonial proceeds would be divided as follows, with the matrimonial home being sold in the open market.

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="33.6667333466693%"> <col width="33.1666333266653%"> <col width="33.1666333266653%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Father</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Mother</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Assets in Party’s sole name/possession</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$222,557.15</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>(Annex B)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$24,188.44</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>(Annex C)</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Proceeds from sale of matrimonial home</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$53,356.30</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$184,807.51</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$275,913.45</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$208,995.95</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

39     This divided the proceeds of sale 77.6:22.4 in favour of the Mother. It was a reflection of the Father’s greater share of assets in his possession and name, and the fact that the Mother would need more monies up front to purchase a home for herself and the children.

40     Parties also asked me to decide on the period within which the sale must be completed and the portion of each party’s share of the expenses accruing from the matrimonial home pending the sale. The Father’s counsel did not object to the matrimonial home being sold within a 6 month period from the date of final judgement, and was agreeable to the expenses being shared in proportion with each party’s share of the sale proceeds – i.e. 77.6:22.4 with the Mother bearing the greater share.

## H.   COSTS

41     On the issue of costs, the Father submitted that the Mother be asked to pay costs. This was based on the costs thrown away for 3 extensions of time given for the Mother to comply with court directions – about $750.00 in total. The Mother asked the court to award her the costs of the private investigator engaged to procure proof of the Father’s adultery – about $7,000.00. I decided that on the balance, there be no order as to costs, given that neither party had really obtained all the relief they had prayed for. Costs for the private investigator were not awarded as the Mother had not provided any proof that she had incurred these expenses.
