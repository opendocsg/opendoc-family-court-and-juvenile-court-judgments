Family Law – Adultery – Section 95(5)(b) Women’s Charter

Civil Procedure – Striking Out – Vexatious – Abuse of Process

23 April 2020

### District Judge Azmin Jailani:

## Introduction

1       SUM 3856/2019 (“SUM 3856”) was an application by the defendant- wife against the plaintiff-husband to strike out the plaintiff’s claim that the marriage be dissolved because of adultery. Consequentially, the defendant prayed that references in the plaintiff’s Statement of Particulars to such particulars of adultery be struck off.

2       The defendant also sought other tangential prayers, which include, _inter alia_, that there be a stay of the divorce proceedings pending the disposal of SUM 3856.

3       After hearings parties, I dismissed the defendant’s striking out application. As regards the tangential prayers sought, I declined to make any orders on those prayers. Dissatisfied, the defendant filed HCF/RAS 3/2020 (“RAS 3”) appealing against the _entirety_ of my decision. I now provide the grounds of my decision.

## Documents filed by Parties

4       For the purposes of SUM 3856, the following documents submitted by parties are relevant:

## Background

6       Parties were married in June 1996. There are 3 children to the marriage.

7       On 1 October, the plaintiff commenced divorce proceedings. In his Statement of Claim (“SOC”), the plaintiff initially relied solely on the ground of unreasonable behaviour pursuant to section 95(3)(b) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353)(“WC”)(the “unreasonable behaviour claim”). The following day (2 October 2019), the plaintiff filed Statement of Claim Amendment No.1 (“SOCA1”) to include the additional ground of adultery pursuant to section 95(3)(a) WC in support of this claim (the “adultery claim”).

8       For completeness, the plaintiff’s Statement of Claim was amended again after the defendant commenced SUM 3856. However, this second amendment did not affect the adultery claim, which forms the subject matter of this appeal.

9       On 1 October 2019, the defendant filed her Memorandum of Appearance indicating, amongst other things, that she would be contesting the action. On that basis and pursuant to Rule 56 of the Family Justice Rules, the defendant was due to file her Defence (and Counterclaim, if any) by 23 October 2019[^1].

### Statement of Particulars

10     The plaintiff organised his Statement of Particulars (“SOP”) such that based on the headings used, paragraphs 1(a) to 1(h) appeared to relate specifically to the unreasonable claim, whilst paragraphs 1(i) to 1(u) appeared to deal with the adultery claim.

11     Whilst organised in that fashion, it was fairly evident after a review of the SOP that the particulars relating to _both_ the adultery claim and the unreasonable behaviour _intermingled and co-related_ with each other. Therefore, to understand the proper context of the plaintiff’s pleadings, I found it apposite to reproduce the following portions of the SOP:

> Particulars of unreasonable behaviour

> ...

> b.    The Defendant has commenced an extra-marital affair with the Co-Defendant sometime in mid or late 2018 and refused to have conjugal relations with the Plaintiff. She became cold, distant and short-tempered with the Plaintiff but refused to tell the Plaintiff the reasons.

> c.    Since the Defendant started her affair with the Co-Defendant, she has also become verbally abusive towards the Plaintiff. The Defendant also falsely accused the Plaintiff of manhandling her if he accidentally brushes her when passing.

> d.    The Defendant started returning home later at about 10pm to 12am on weekdays, except Thursdays when she goes for yoga, and refused to give an explanation for her late nights out. By early 2019, the Defendant had started staying out the whole night on some occasions and when confronted by the Plaintiff for the reasons, she claimed that she had returned to her mother’s home and need not ask for his permission. The children also told the Plaintiff that they did not know where their mother went.

> e.    The Plaintiff suspected that the Defendant is having an extra-marital affair as she has become very conscious of her appearance and is dressing beyond what is required as an office secretary. The Plaintiff also noticed that the Defendant would sometimes return home in clothes different from what she had worn in the morning when she left for work. The Defendant was also frequently messaging surreptitiously on her phone. Even the children could not get the Defendant to tell them who the Defendant was messaging or talking to.

> f.    The Defendant and Co-Defendant contact each other frequently vide whatsapp and would send each other loving emojis. The Defendant would engage in small talk with the Co-Defendant any time of the day and would offer to be his personal food panda delivery service and enquire about his welfare. The Co-Defendant is not someone known to the family, and the Defendant has no reason to show such concern for him to the exclusion of the Plaintiff and their children.

> g.    The Plaintiff had personally witnessed the Defendant visiting the Co-Defendant at his home at \[XXX\] on 6th March 2019 and stayed till midnight.

> h.    On another occasion, the Plaintiff’s private investigator trailed the Defendant after work on 28th March 2019 and witnessed her entering the Co-Defendant’s flat in which she stayed for about 3 hours with only the bathroom lit up during the said period.

> Particulars of Adultery

> i.    On 6th March 2019, the Plaintiff was able to track the Defendant’s whereabouts after 9pm and found that she was at \[XXX\]. The Plaintiff made his way to this block of flats and waited at the base of this block until about 12:04am when he sighted the Defendant and a man, who he now knows as the Co-Defendant, coming down this block of flats and waiting for a taxi. The Defendant returned home in the early hours of the morning on this day.

> j.    Despite repeated queries, the Defendant refused to explain her activities to the Plaintiff and her reasons for going to \[XXX\]. She told the Plaintiff it is none of his business what she does with her free time.

> k.    In mid-March 2019, the Plaintiff found compromising messages on the Defendant’s whatsapp account with the Co-Defendant. For example, on 19th March 2019, the Co-Defendant messaged the Defendant at 10:57am during her working hours to say:

>> “_I thought it was waiter \[sic\] u’re sleepy or you missed sleeping in my arms_”. The Defendant replied in the affirmative and the Co-Defendant sent her emojis with love signs on them.

> l.    The Defendant and Co-Defendant also frequently messaged each other during her working hours making small talk and sending love emojis to each other. This is something that the Defendant does not do with the Plaintiff or their children.

> m.    On 13th March 2019, the Plaintiff instructed a private investigator from \[YYY\] (the “PI”) to obtain evidence of the Defendant’s extra-marital affair.

> n.    On 28th March 2019, the PI saw the Defendant leaving her office at about 6:12pm and followed her to Chinatown Point where she had dinner with a friend. The PI sent another team to keep surveillance on \[XXX\] at about 7pm. The Co-Defendant was sighted returning home at about 8:18pm.

> o.    At 8:27 pm, the PI followed the Defendant from Chinatown Point where she ordered a taxi and trailed her to \[XXX\]. The Defendant was seen at \[XXX\] at 8:30pm and was texting on her phone. She waited for a reply for about 5 minutes before she took the lift to the 3rd floor. The PI ran up the stairs and saw her getting out of the lift and entering unit \[ZZZ\]. The iron gate to the unit was left unlocked as the Co-Defendant was expecting her, and she was let into the flat.

> p.    After the Defendant entered the said flat, the PI kept surveillance from about 8:48pm to 11:49pm before they sighted the Defendant and Co-Defendant leaving the flat. During these almost 3 hours, the said parties were alone in the flat with all lights, except for the one in the bathroom, switched off.

> q.    The PI surveillance showed that the Defendant and Co-Defendant could have spent almost 3 hours in the bathroom as it was the only room in the flat that was lit throughout the time they were in the flat, or would have gone to an unlit room to have sex. There were no other occupants in the said flat.

> r.    After the Defendant left at about 11:35pm, the PI saw the Co-Defendant returning to his flat and the lights in the living room and kitchen were switched on at this juncture. The Co-Defendant was seen smoking at the kitchen window.

> s.    The Plaintiff’s evidence coincides with the PI’s timings and dates as the whatsapp messages in the Defendant’s phone showed that she messaged the Co-Defendant at 8:19pm when she was at Chinatown Point on 28th March 2019 to state that she was on the way to his flat. At 8:26pm, while on the ground floor beneath the flat, the Co-Defendant messaged to ask if they had time to bath together. The Defendant replied that she needed 5 minutes and the Co-Defendant indicated that he would wait for her. This explains the PI’s surveillance report which showed that the Defendant was waiting for about 5 minutes before she took the lift to the flat. The messages also explained why only the bathroom lights were on throughout the 3 hours when the Defendant and Co-Defendant were in the flat.

> t.    It is obvious that the aforesaid PI surveillance of the Defendant and the Co-Defendant on 28th March 2019 evidences that the said parties were having sex in the bathroom or another room of the flat. Only the bathroom was lit-up for 3 hours or so while they were in the flat. There is no reason for either party to bathe for almost 3 hours.

> …

> (_emphasis original)_

12     Whilst the SOP, on its face, appeared to have demarcated the adultery claim and unreasonable behaviour claim into distinct portions, the extract above shows that the narrative regarding the defendant’s extra-marital activities (and associated unreasonable behaviour towards the plaintiff) was an _interrelated and evolving narrative_. Significantly, whilst not drafted in the clearest of fashions (despite having the benefit of counsel), the SOP concludes with the following statement (at paragraph 1(u)):

> u.    As far as the Plaintiff is aware, the extra-marital affair between the Defendant and the Co-Defendant _is still ongoing_ and the _Defendant continues to not only keep late nights daily, but have started not returning home the whole night on several occasions_. The Defendant has also told the Plaintiff that she wants out of the marriage on her separation basis and has consulted her employers, who are lawyers, as to what she can expect from a divorce.

> (emphasis added)

13     From the express language of the SOP (albeit a lack of particulars), the plaintiff makes reference to the defendant’s allegedly “ongoing” (or continuing) extra-marital affair with the co-defendant.

14     That was the state of the plaintiff’s pleadings.

15     Notwithstanding this concluding paragraph in the SOP, I do note that the plaintiff placed a fair amount of emphasis on his knowledge (expressly or constructively) of the extra-marital affair on the following occasions:

> (a)     6 March 2019;

> (b)     19 March 2019; and

> (c)     28 March 2019.

> (the “specific events of adultery”)

16     At this point, it would be useful to recap that the plaintiff commenced divorce proceedings on 1 October 2019. On the specific events of adultery above, it is relevant to note that the plaintiff had commenced divorce proceedings _more than 6 months after_ the specific events of adultery. As will be elaborated below, the crux of the plaintiff’s case in SUM 3856 is his reliance on section 95(5)(b) WC, which provides that:

> (5)    Where the parties to the marriage have _lived with each other_ for any period or periods _after_ it became known to the plaintiff that the defendant had, since the celebration of the marriage, committed adultery, then —

>> …

>> (b)    if the length of that period or of those periods together exceeded 6 months, the plaintiff shall not be entitled to rely on _that_ adultery for the purposes of subsection (3)(a).

>> (emphasis added)

### SUM 3856

17     Instead of filing her Defence, the defendant, curiously in my view, commenced SUM 3856 on 7 November 2019. I pause here and note that the defendant commenced SUM 3856 _after_ the deadline for filing her was due.

18     The entire suite of prayers sought by the defendant in SUM 3856 is reproduced below:

> The Defendant applies for the following orders;

>> 1.    The following portion of paragraph 6 of the Statement of Clam (Amendment No.1) herein be struck out:

>>> “Fact(s) relied upon for the irretrievable breakdown of the marriage (for the purpose of section 95 (3) of the Women's Charter): That the Defendant has committed adultery and the Plaintiff finds it intolerable to live with the Defendant".

>> 2.    All references to extra-marital affairs and/or adultery in the Statement of Particulars herein be struck out, namely, the whole of paragraphs 1b to 1u or parts thereof;

>> 3.    There be a stay of proceedings herein until this application has been heard and disposed of;

>> 4.    There be an extension of time for the Defendant to file and serve the Defence and Counterclaim until 14 days after the Statement of Claim and Statement of Particulars have been amended to exclude the parts to be struck out or in such manner as may be directed by this Court;

>> 5.    No interim judgment may be entered by the Plaintiff herein against the Defendant until 14 days after the Statement of Claim and Statement of Particulars herein have been amended to exclude the parts to be struck out or in such in the manner as may be directed by this Court;

>> 6.    Costs of, incidental to, arising from and/or consequential to this application be fixed and paid by the Plaintiff to the Defendant forthwith; and

>> 7.    Such further or other order(s) as this Court shall think just.

19     I pause here to state why I found the defendant’s approach curious. As I highlighted at \[7\] above, the plaintiff sought a divorce on _both_ the adultery claim and the unreasonable behaviour claim. Assuming SUM 3856 was successful, the defendant still had the unreasonable behaviour claim to deal with. Given that the particulars for both claims were symbiotic, the basis of striking out of the adultery claim (at least in so far as the defendant was relying on the time bar in section 95(5)(b) WC) _would not apply_ to the unreasonable behaviour claim. When considered in that light, the defendant would have been aware of the real utility in striking out the paragraphs 1(b) to 1(h) of the SOP (which ostensibly dealt with the unreasonable behaviour claim). Taken to its logical conclusion, the defendant would still have to deal with the unreasonable behaviour claim, and _necessarily file her defence_.

### Summons No. 3890/2019

20     4 days after the defendant commenced SUM 3856, the defendant commenced Summons No. 3890/2019 (“SUM 3890”), which essentially replicates Prayers 3 and 4 of SUM 3856 (i.e., prayers for a stay of the divorce proceedings and an extension of time to file her Defence and Counterclaim). For completeness, SUM 3890 also dealt with a prayer for the plaintiff to amend an inconsistency between the Writ of Summons and the Statement of Claim.

21     In the supporting affidavit filed personally by the defendant’s solicitor, Mr Peh, SUM 3890 was necessitated by the plaintiff’s apparent refusal to hold the divorce proceedings in abeyance until after the disposal of SUM 3856. In a letter dated 6 November 2019 by the plaintiff’s solicitors (a day before the defendant commenced SUM 3890), it was stated that:

> 7.    Please note that your client is to comply with the FJR deadlines for her Defence and Counterclaim, if any. There will be no indulgence from our client considering the allegations raised in your letter as our client does not wish for a protracted proceeding.

22     Given the apparent urgency of the matter, SUM 3890 was disposed of before the Duty Registrar on 13 November 2019. For the purposes of these proceedings, the following orders made in SUM 3890 are relevant:

> (a)     First, a stay of the divorce proceedings was granted pending the disposal of SUM 3856. The upshot of this was that Prayer 3 of SUM 3856 had been dealt with.

> (b)     Second, an extension of time was granted for the defendant to file her Defence and Counterclaim 14 days after the conclusion of SUM 3856. Again, the upshot of this was that Prayer 4 of 3856 had been dealt with.

### Summons No. 4432/2019

23     In response to SUM 3856, the plaintiff filed his reply affidavits on 27 November 2019. In addition to his reply affidavit (P1), the plaintiff also filed an affidavit by his father (PW1) and the domestic helper (PW2). Thereafter, the defendant filed her final reply affidavit (D2), responding to P1, PW1, and PW2. It is separately noted that after filing D2, the plaintiff filed a further supplementary affidavit (P2).

24     In PW2, the domestic helper highlighted, among other things, that:

> (a)     she noticed the defendant returning home “nearer midnight on most days”[^2];

> (b)     the defendant slept in the daughter’s room from around June 2019, whilst the plaintiff slept in the master bedroom with the youngest child[^3]; and

> (c)     the defendant “started purchasing clothes and personal effects from the internet”[^4], and “noticed that these packages contained mostly sexy and lacy underwear”[^5]. In this regard, she was instructed by the defendant to wash the defendant’s clothes separately from the rest of the family.[^6] In PW2, the domestic helper exhibited pictures of the aforementioned undergarments.[^7]

> The upshot of the helper’s evidence in PW2 would be the ‘separation’ (or lack of cohabitation) between the plaintiff and defendant.

25     Following from PW2, the defendant filed Summons No. 4432/2019 (“SUM 4432”) seeking, amongst other things, to strike out the aforementioned portions of PW2[^8], and for leave to file a further reply to P2. Insofar as SUM 4432 sought to strike out the above portions of PW2, the defendant’s contention was that the domestic helper’s evidence was “irrelevant and frivolous but also highly embarrassing”[^9]. I also note that it was the defendant’s contention that the domestic helpers’ evidence was tailored.[^10] Interestingly, I note that in her supporting affidavit for SUM 4432, the defendant took the position that ascertaining the veracity of the helper’s evidence, at least in relation to the defendant’s behaviour and purchases suggesting the existence and persistence of the extra-marital affair, necessitated the domestic helper to be cross-examined.[^11] By the defendant’s own contention, the resolution of the adultery claim did not appear to be one which could be summarily dealt with on the face of parties’ affidavits.

26     After hearing parties submissions, I was not inclined to strike out portions of PW2. I did however grant the defendant leave to file a supplementary affidavit dealing with the issue of whether the domestic helpers’ affidavit was tailored. On 17 January 2020, the defendant filed D4.

27     Separately, and whilst not the subject of the present appeal, I would highlight some points I raised at the hearing of SUM 4432 insofar as they were precursors of some concerns I had with SUM 3856 pending the filing of D4:

> (a)     First, it was only after the Court’s questioning that the defendant’s solicitor, Mr Peh, accepted that in order for SUM 3856 to succeed, there would first have to be an acknowledgement that the defendant did commit adultery. I raised this because nowhere in her affidavit does the defendant make this confirmation, and since the defendant had not filed her Defence, her position on that matter was unclear (or at least not made expressly). To be fair, a review of D1 and D2 shows that the thrust of the defendant’s evidence was that the plaintiff and the defendant were living in the same household together more than 6 months after the specific events of adultery, implicitly suggesting the defendant’s affirmation of the extra-marital affair.

> (b)     Second, and more importantly, I pointed Mr Peh to paragraph 1(u) of the SOP, where there was the allegation of the “ongoing” extra-marital affair. When queried, Mr Peh squarely accepted, rightly in my view, that if the plaintiff were able to establish continuing acts of adultery (or a continuing extra-marital affair) by the defendant _after_ the specific events of adultery, then that would completely undermine SUM 3856. I specifically invited Mr Peh to address me on this issue at the final hearing of SUM 3856.

## Parties’ arguments

28     Against that backdrop, I turn to summarising parties’ arguments.

29     In the supporting affidavit for SUM 3856 (before SUM 4432 was heard), the crux of the defendant’s contention was that the plaintiff was not allowed to rely on any of the specific events of adultery because the plaintiff had “continued to live with \[her\] for more than 6 months after he had come to know of it”.[^12] In that affidavit, the defendant sought to highlight how she and the plaintiff “continued to live together normally as usual in the same household”[^13] after the specific events of adultery.

30     Notably, in that affidavit, the defendant _did not_ address paragraph 1(u) of the SOP (i.e., the allegation that the extra-marital affair was “ongoing”).

31     In response, the plaintiff made the following points:

> (a)     The plaintiff repeated his position that the extra-marital affair “is still continuing at the time I filed the divorce”[^14].

> (b)     That he and the defendant has had a strained relationship after the extra-marital affair, and that parties “basically led separate lives”[^15]. In this connection, the plaintiff contested the specific instances relied on by the defendant to suggest that parties were living in the ‘same household’.[^16] Indeed, it is worth noting that the bulk of the plaintiff’s written submissions was dedicated to highlighting what section 95(5)(b) WC did not apply insofar as parties were not staying in the same household.[^17]

32     Needless to say, the defendant’s counter (esp. in D2) was, by, _inter alia_, “referring extensively to the whatsapp messages”[^18], as well as other points to contend that parties were continuing as a family unit after the specific events of adultery.[^19]

33     In her written submissions, the defendant framed her legal case as follows:

> 41.    It being clear that parties have _lived with each other in the same household_ for more than 6 months, section 95(5)(b) applies to prohibit the Plaintiff from relying on the alleged adultery in 2018 and 6 March 2019 for purposes of section 95(3)(a).

> 34    \[sic\]. The reference to affairs/adultery should therefore be struck out under Family Justice Rules 405 for being _vexatious and/or otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court_.

> (errors in formatting original in PWS)

34     As I highlighted above (see \[27\] above), I had asked Mr Peh to consider the effect of paragraph 1(u) SOP to his overall case. Again, Mr Peh was prepared to accept that if the extra-marital affair continued beyond March 2019, he would not be able to rely on section 95(5)(b) WC to strike out the adultery claim in its totality. While Mr Peh was not able to provide with any additional material relating to the operation of section 95(5)(b) WC, he shifted his attack against paragraph 1(u) SOP itself. In this respect:

> (a)     Mr Peh sought to impress on me that paragraph 1(u) SOP, which alleged the continuing extra-marital affair after the specific events of adultery, was devoid of any meaningful particulars such that it should be disregarded. Put another way, whilst Mr Peh appeared to have conceded the _general effect_ of paragraph 1(u) SOP, particularly its fatal effect to SUM 3856, the application is salvaged by virtue of its lack of particulars.

> (b)     To this end, Mr Peh referred me to the decision of _Chen Stella Yfantidis v Chen Yun Hian Christopher_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGDC 35</span> (“_Chen Stella_”). Whilst this decision did not deal with section 95(5)(b) WC, it was a decision on the need to be clear in pleadings in matrimonial proceedings. Whilst Mr Peh focused my attention to particular portions of _Chen Stella_, I found it apposite to reproduce a larger extract of the court’s decision:

>> Principles of Pleadings in Matrimonial Cases

>> 6    At this juncture, it would be useful for me to discuss the general principles of pleadings in matrimonial cases. I must recognise that the task of drafting a divorce petition is not an easy one. The distinction between material facts, subordinate facts, and evidence is often very fine. In practice, the degree of particularity between divorce petitions varies greatly, and I surmise that this depends on such variable factors as the degree of acrimony between the parties, the extent to which the petitioner is interested, at the outset, in coming to a settlement in the matter, and the petitioner’s counsel’s own drafting practices and preferences. Unfortunately, there appears to be a lack of local authority as well as literature on this pleading point, in the context of matrimonial proceedings. I must therefore have recourse to some English authorities on the matter, which have set out some basic principles, as well as local authorities in ordinary civil matters.

>> Principles of pleadings generally

>> 7    It is trite law that facts, not evidence, are to be pleaded. (See Order 18 Rule 7 (Facts, not evidence to be pleaded) of the ROC). In addition, only material facts are to be pleaded, not all the relevant facts. (See paragraph 18/7/2 of Singapore Court Practice 2003). Material facts are those facts which must be proved in order to establish the existence of the cause of action. (See paragraph 18/7/2 of Singapore Court Practice, supra)

>> As stated in Williams v. Wilcox (1838) 8 Ad & El 314:

>>> “It is an elementary rule in pleading that when a state \[sic\] of fact is relied on, it is enough to allege it simply without setting out the subordinate facts which are the means of proving it, or the evidence sustaining the allegation.” (emphasis added) (per Lord Denman CJ, at page 331) (quoted at page 348 paragraph 7, Rayden & Jackson’s Law and Practice in Divorce and Family Matters, Volume 1, 1997 Edition)

>> It is also trite law that an opinion, being an interpretation of a set of facts, cannot itself be a material fact.

>> 8     _On the other hand, all material facts must be pleaded, in order to put the other party on his guard and tell him what case he has to meet when it comes on for trial_. I keep in mind the basic principle that:

>> “Pleadings operate so as to prevent trial by ambush and…encourage litigants to put their cards on the table.” (See Civil Procedure, 2003 Edition, Pinsler, at paragraph 841.1)

>> _If the court is too quick to strike out pleadings , or portions of pleadings , it may have a chilling effect on the party’s willingness to put “all his cards on the table”._

>> 9    Moreover, if a party does not plead the material facts, then he is not entitled to give any evidence of them at trial. (See paragraph 18/7/2 of Singapore Court Practice, supra—Consequence of not pleading a material fact) _The court must therefore be careful not to shut the door on aspects of a party’s case by striking out material facts from his pleadings_.

>> …

>> Principles of pleading in matrimonial proceedings

>> 11    The principle that material facts (and only material facts) are to be pleaded is as applicable to matrimonial proceedings as it is to ordinary civil proceedings. (See Rayden & Jackson’s Law and Practice in Divorce and Family Matters, supra, at page 326, and the Law and Practice in Matrimonial Causes, Passingham and Harmer, 1985 Edition, at page 201). It is also clear from Rule 6(2) of the Women’s Charter (Matrimonial Proceedings) Rules 2003 (“the MPR 2003”) that evidence should not be pleaded in the affidavit in support of the divorce petition, but only particulars of the facts stated in the divorce petition.

>> (_emphasis added_)

35     In relying on _Chen Stella_ (particularly \[7\] & \[8\] of the judgment), Mr Peh sought to impress on me that paragraph 1(u) SOP was so general and imprecise that the allegation of a continuing extra-marital affair could not have constituted a material fact. Instead, Mr Peh characterised paragraph 1(u) SOP merely as an opinion, and therefore not material facts.

36     Because paragraph 1(u) SOP cannot be construed as a ‘material fact’, it ought to be struck out, thereby saving Mr Peh’s position in SUM 3856. Further, Mr Peh submits that the lack of clarity of paragraph 1(u) SOP was such that the defendant would not know what case she would have to meet, and this would akin to a trial by ambush.[^20]

37     On the basis that I was not with him, Mr Peh submitted his alternative case that if the adultery claim could not be struck out in its entirety, at least references to the specific events of adultery be struck out.

38     In response, Ms Yap, counsel for the plaintiff, addressed the issue of paragraph 1(u) SOP. While she acknowledged that the paragraph could have been drafted better, her main point was that the defect was something which could be rectified by the provisions of further and better particulars.

## Analysis and findings

39     I now turn to my analysis and findings. I first touch on the legal principles applicable to a striking out application. I will then deal with the ambit of section 95(5)(b) WC. Thereafter, I will give the reasons for my findings.

### Applicable principles for striking out applications

40     The court’s power to strike out a party’s pleading is provided for in Rule 405 of the Family Justice Rules (S 813/2014) (“FJR”). Rule 405 FJR is derived from Order 18 Rule 19 of the Rules of Court (Cap 332 R 5)(“ROC”). It is not uncontroversial that the principles laid out in Order 18 Rule 19 ROC are applicable to an application under Rule 405 FJR.

41     Rule 405 FJR provides that:

> 405.—(1)    The Court may at any stage of the proceedings order to be struck out or amended any pleading or the endorsement of any writ in the action, or anything in any pleading or in the endorsement, on the ground that —

>> (a) it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence, as the case may be;

>> (b) it is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious;

>> (c) it may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the

>> action; or

>> (d) it is otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court.

42     As highlighted above (see \[33\] above), the defendant relies on Rules 405(1)(b) and (c) FJR, specifically that the particulars relating to the adultery claim are “vexatious” and/or “an abuse of process”.

43     As highlighted in _Singapore Court Practice 2017: Vol 1_ (Pinsler SC, LexisNexis) (“_Singapore Court Practice”)_(at page 796), the four grounds in Rule 405 tend to overlap with each other. Be that as it may, the authorities have generated certain specific characteristics to each specific ground. To the extent that the defendant relies only on the ‘vexatious’ and ‘abuse of process’ ground, I go on to analysing the key characteristics of each ground.

44     As to what constitutes “vexatious”:

> (a)     In her submissions[^21], the defendant characterises a vexatious pleading as one which is not brought bona fide, with the intent to annoy or embarrass his/her opponent, or one which is not calculated to lead to any practical result. This characterisation is derived from the decision in _Goh Koon Suan v Heng Gek Kiau_ \[1991\] MLJ 307 (at 311).

> (b)     Whilst there is no reason for me not to accept the defendant’s definition, I found it apposite, for a more holistic appreciation of the ground, to highlight the other characterisations of the phrase ‘vexatious’ (as highlighted in _Singapore Court Practice_):

>> (i)       A case is considered vexatious when it is “obviously unsustainable” or “wrong” (_Singapore Court Practice_ at page 808).

>> (ii)       A vexatious pleading connotes purposelessness in relation to the process, or a lack of seriousness or truth, and a lack of bona fides (_Singapore Court Practice_ at page 809).

>> (iii)       In ascertaining whether a claim is vexatious, the court is prepared to _consider the party’s conduct_ during the course of the proceedings for the purposes of determining whether the conditions for the operation of that ground have been satisfied (_Singapore Court Practice_ at page 810)

> (c)     To my mind, the ‘vexatious’ grounds calls on the examination on _both_ the substantive merits of the application (i.e., whether there is a legal basis on the claims made) _as well as_ a qualitative assessment of the conduct of the party (i.e., whether there was any real seriousness and/or _bona fides_ in making the claim).

45     As to what constitutes “an abuse of process”:

> (a)     The defendant relied on this oft-cited extract of the Court of Appeal’s decision in _Gabriel Peter & Partners v Wee Chong Jin_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 3 SLR(R) 649</span> (“_Gabriel Peter”_):

>> The term, 'abuse of the process of the Court', in O 18 r 19(1)(d), has been given a wide interpretation by the courts. It includes considerations of public policy and the interests of justice. _This term signifies that the process of the court must be used bona fide and properly and must not be abused. The court will prevent the improper use of its machinery. It will prevent the judicial process from being used as a means of vexation and oppression in the process of litigation_. The categories of conduct rendering a claim frivolous, vexatious or an abuse of process are not closed and will depend on all the relevant circumstances of the case…

>> (_emphasis added_)

> (b)     To my mind, the ‘abuse of process’ ground is a catch all phrase underscoring the Court’s broader and inherent jurisdiction to exercise its discretion to prevent the improper use of the judicial ‘machinery’ against another party. Whether and how this discretion is exercised depends on the specific facts of the case.

46     In his submissions, the plaintiff did not really go into the ambit of Rule 405 FJR. Instead, the plaintiff challenged the entire premise of SUM 3856. Whilst somewhat technical in nature, the plaintiff argues that neither the summons nor the supporting affidavit for SUM 3856 (D1) specifically state the specific ground under Rule 405 FJR relied on to strike out paragraphs 1(b) to 1(u) SOP.[^22]

47     To be fair to the plaintiff, he only knew of the defendant’s _legal_ case upon receipt of her written submissions. While Mr Peh argued that paragraph 1(u) SOP was akin to a trial by ambush, it was somewhat ironic that the defendant truly crystallised her case _only_ in her written submissions. Be that as it may, I do not think that Ms Yap was seriously contesting the base principles in connection with a striking out application. What could be discerned from her submissions that it was not ‘plainly obvious’ that the defendant could avail herself to section 95(5)(b) WC.

48     While the literature on these two provisions shed light on how those provisions specifically operate, I found it apposite, to my mind, to restate certain general principles worth bearing in mind when contemplating a striking out application:

> (a)     The act of striking out is a hard and exacting chastisement on a party’s case. The effect of striking out is that a party’s averment would not go through the entire adjudication process. As alluded to by the court in _Chen Stella_, striking out essentially shuts the door on a party’s case.

> (b)     Striking out connotes a situation where a party’s averment is fundamentally so bad, incurable, inexplicable, and unhelpful that it should not even be dignified by seeing the entire journey of the adjudication processes.

> (c)     Ultimately, it is a balance between allowing a party to put its case before the court, and preventing parties simply saying what they want, as opposed to saying what they should. Indeed, in _VGY v VGV_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHCF 6</span> (“_VGY_”), the High Court reiterated the observations made by the Court of Appeal in _UYQ v UYP_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 3</span> (at \[4\]) where matters placed before the court must go through sufficient “accounting rigour”, and must “illuminate” rather than “obscure”. The real touchstone is whether the matters placed before the court will “assist \[it\] to reach a just decision” (_VGY_ at \[10\]).

> (d)     Separately, given the far-reaching effects of striking out a party’ case, how this discretion ought to be exercised ought to, in my view, also be commensurate with the stage of proceedings parties are at. In _VGY_, parties were already at the ancillary stage of the matrimonial proceedings. Specifically, the offending materials were in the husband’s 2nd affidavit of assets and means. By then, parties’ affidavits would be crystallised, and the approach to be adopted in dealing with ancillary matters is fairly uncontroversial (i.e., the ANJ Approach). Matters that detract from the court’s analysis would (and should) not be dignified with its continued presence, or take up the court’s finite resources.

> (e)     Unlike _VGY_, parties in the present case are in the initial stages of the proceedings. In fact, the only real pleading existing at the material time was the SOP. As I highlighted earlier, the defendant did not even file her Defence. Striking out at such an early stage might unnecessarily curtail a party’s case, but more significantly, as noted in _Chen Stella_, have the chilling effect on a party’s willingness to properly put their cards on the table. What you get is the opposite problem in _VGY_ – where a party might be incentivised to saying very much less (which is equally unhelpful to the court), instead of enough.

> (f)     In this connection, instead of striking out, it is open for this court to be amend pleadings for include sufficient particulars to be included. As noted in _Singapore Court Practice_ (at 18/19/4):

>> **_Options available to the court_**

>> The court has the option to cure (O 2) or allow an amendment (under O18 r 19 and O 20) rather than strike out, but an amendment would only be ordered if it is the appropriate method of curing the error or defect. _Generally, the courts prefer to allow an amendment rather than the much more drastic action of striking out a process_. The issue of whether a court will give leave to amend a pleading by deletion or addition of material depending on a number of factors such as the nature of the amendment, the stage of proceedings which had been reached, and whether the amendment would prejudice the other party.

>> …

>> **_Pleading may be rectified by provision of particulars_**

>> The court may order that sufficient particulars be given to cure omissions or vague please, and a request for further and better particulars will generally succeed on this basis.

> (g)     Similar comments were made by the authors of _Singapore Civil Procedure 2020 : Volume 1_ (2020, Sweet & Maxwell)(“_Singapore Civil Procedure_”)(at 18/19/2):

>> **Striking out or amendment** – The rule also empowers the court to amend any pleading or indorsement or any matter therein. _If a statement of claim does not disclose a cause of action relied on, an opportunity to amend may be given, though the formulation of the amendment is not before the court_… But unless there is reason to suppose that the case can be improved by amendment, leave will not be given… Where the statement of claim presented discloses no cause of action because some material averment has been omitted, the court, while striking out the pleading, will not dismiss the action, but give the plaintiff leave to amend …, unless the court is satisfied that no amendment will cure the defect … “Insufficient particulars” cannot be a good reason for striking out.

>> (emphasis added)

> (h)     Lastly, it is worth citing a different portion of _Gabriel Peter_ (at \[21\]):

>> As long as the statement of claim discloses some cause of action, or raises some question fit to be decided at the trial, the mere fact that the case is weak and is not likely to succeed is no ground for striking it out. _Where a statement of claim is defective only in not containing particulars to which the defendant is entitled, the application should be made for particulars under O 18 r 12 and not for an order to strike out the statement_.

>> (emphasis added)

> (i)     To my mind, the availability to amend (as opposed to striking out), ensures that all relevant issues are placed before the court for a considered determination to be made. This is in line with the court’s judge-led powers in Rule 22 FJR. I would pause here and clarify that this _does not_ constitute a free pass for parties to submit glaringly bad pleadings, with the hopes that court will rescue them from their own deficiencies (or excess as the case may be).

49     Ultimately, the court will consider whether the matters sought to be struck off is sufficiently hopeless and beyond redemption such that its continued presence has no meaningful purpose to the resolution of the dispute.

### Section 95(5)(b) Women’s Charter

50     Against that backdrop, I turn to the substantive provision relied on by the defendant. To recap, section 95(5)(b) WC provides that:

> (5)    Where the parties to the marriage _have lived with each other_ for any period or periods _after it became known to the plaintiff_ that the _defendant had_, since the celebration of the marriage, _committed adultery_, then —

>> …

>> (b)    if the length of that period or of those periods together exceeded 6 months, the plaintiff shall not be entitled to rely on _that_ adultery for the purposes of subsection (3)(a).

>> (emphasis added)

51     Unfortunately, the defendant provided no guidance (in terms of case law or any treatise) on the specific operation of the provision (and by extension, how the defendant could rely on this provision as a conclusive answer to the adultery claim).

52     As such, I first highlight the comments made by the authors of _Elements of Family Law in Singapore_ (3rd Edition, LexisNexis, 2018)(“_Elements_”)(at \[6.068\]):

> **Adultery no longer usable where continued cohabitation for more than six months after discovery**

> The Women’s Charter section 95(5)(b) provides an absolute bar to the plaintiff relying on the commission of adultery as proof of irretrievable breakdown of marriage if she, having knowledge of the commission, still cohabited with the defendant for periods that together exceeded six months. Cohabitation of that length after adultery renders it unusable as proof of irretrievable breakdown of marriage.

53     Following from the comments of _Elements_ and on a plain reading of section 95(5)(b) WC, I make the following observations on how a defendant would be able to rely on the time bar:

> (a)     First, the plaintiff must have obtained knowledge of the defendant’s adultery (see _Elements_ at \[6.059\] to \[6.067\] on methods of proof of adultery).

> (b)     Second, the plaintiff and the defendant must have “lived with each other” for an aggregate period of 6 months after the discovery of the adultery. This raises the question of what the phase “live with each other” means? Even in the extract of _Elements_ above, the author replaces the phrase with “cohabitation”, which does not really advance the point. Separately, while phrased in opposite terms, sections 95(3)(d) and 95(3)(e) WC coins the ‘separation’ grounds as parties having “lived apart”. Do the standards of separation in those sections apply wholly to section 95(5)(b) WC (albeit in the opposite fashion)? The authors of _Elements_ appears to answer this question in the affirmative (see _Elements_ at \[6.111\] to \[6.113\]). The defendant also appears to have accepted this, citing the decision of _UOU v UOV_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGFC 82</span>. In his response affidavits and written submissions, the plaintiff himself appears to acknowledge that that is the standard to be applied (i.e. the touchstones of physical separation, mental element of separation, and loss of consortium). While the determination of SUM 3856 did not turn on the appropriate standard to be applied, and given that parties appear to be _ad idem_ on this point, I will proceed to use this as a basis for my findings.

> (c)     Finally, the time bar would apply to “that” adultery. Again, what does “that” mean? Does it mean the _specific act_ of adultery the plaintiff has knowledge of, or the _party_ who the defendant had the extra marital affair with? As alluded to above, I highlighted to Mr Peh my inclination towards the former characterisation as more appropriate, which Mr Peh agreed. I would even venture to state that even if the former characterisation were to apply, would a plaintiff be denied from stating, purely by way of context, the earlier acts of adultery even though they were caught by the time bar, so long as continuing acts of adultery formed part of the plaintiff’s case?

### Prayers 1 & 2 - Should adultery claim be struck out?

54     Against the backdrop of all the principles enunciated above, I turn now to the defendant’s principal prayer to strike out the adultery claim. To recap, Prayer 1 of SUM 3856 seeks to strike out the adultery claim in its entirety. Prayer 2 of SUM 3856 seeks the consequential striking out of paragraphs 1(b) to 1(u) SOP.

55     I deal with Prayer 1 first.

56     Putting aside the issues with the plaintiff’s drafting, what is fairly evident is that the adultery claim is premised on (i) the specific events of adultery _and_ (ii) the continuing extra-marital affair. When framed in this manner, the defendant’s solitary reliance on section 95(5)(b) WC _might_ be an answer to the specific events of adultery, but will _never_ be a response to the allegation of the continuing extra-marital affair. This is especially so given that _nowhere_ in the plaintiff’s supporting affidavit for SUM 3856 (especially D1) did she specially contend that that extra-marital affair had ceased since after the specific events of adultery.

57     On that basis alone, Prayer 1 must fail.

58     Giving the defendant the greatest benefit of doubt, the plaintiff’s less than ideal drafting may have caused the defendant not to fully appreciate paragraph 1(u) SOP. However, a badly drafted case _does not_ mean that there was no case for the defendant to answer. This is especially so given that the defendant was at liberty to, among other things, seek further and better particulars. Indeed, I pause here and note that in the defendant’s own submissions, she states that:

> Unless the Plaintiff should apply to amend the pleadings, the Court should allow the Defendant’s application herein and have all references to affair/adultery be stuck out.[^23]

59     For completeness, that statement was made in the context that the plaintiff ought not to be able to rely on the specific events of adultery in support of the adultery claim. However, that statement is an express recognition that all that might have been required was an amendment to paragraph 1(u) SOP (which the defendant was entitled to seek). This is especially so given that it cannot be denied that paragraph 1(u) SOP makes express the allegation of a continuing extra-marital affair.

60     At this point, I touch on the defendant’s attack of paragraph 1(u) SOP (see \[34\] above). The crux of the defendant’s case is that that paragraph is bereft of meaningful particulars of any continuing acts of adultery, such that the necessary inference is that the allegation of the continuing extra-marital affair is nothing more than an opinion, is not a material fact, and does not save the adultery claim. In other words, paragraph 1(u) SOP is so deficient it does not actually say anything towards the adultery claim.

61     I was not inclined to accept the defendant’s argument.

62     It is important to note that by seeking to strike out, _inter alia_, paragraph 1(u) SOP, the defendant _must have_ appreciated that the plaintiff was making the case of a continuing extra-marital affair. Instead, it chose not to specifically deal with this averment in her supporting affidavits and her written submissions. Significantly, Mr Peh only really became alive to this issue when I specifically highlighted it to him at the hearing of SUM 4432.

63     It is as if the defendant consciously chose to sweep paragraph 1(u) SOP under the carpet, and hope that it would disappear if she managed to convince this Court to strike out the specific events of adultery. To my mind, the defendant cannot on one hand, seek to strike out a particular paragraph of the SOP, but on the other, not fully appreciate the intent and meaning of the paragraphs she seeks to strike out. Ironically, such a blasé treatment of a party’s pleadings is the kind of thoughtlessness envisaged in striking out applications involving vexatious pleadings.

64     Adopting the striking out principles I cited above, it cannot be said that it was “plainly obvious” that the adultery claim, _in its generality_, was “obviously sustainable”. Accordingly, I found that the adultery claim _was neither_ vexatious nor an abuse of process. For those reasons, I did not grant Prayer 1.

65     I next turn to Prayer 2 (i.e., to strike out paragraphs 1(b) to 1(u) SOP). Flowing from my rejection of the defendant’s prayer to remove the adultery claim in its entirety, the real question was whether, at the very least, _certain_ portions of the SOP, at least insofar as it relates to the _specific events of adultery_ (i.e., paragraphs 1(b) to 1(t) SOP), should nevertheless be struck out.

66     I was not inclined to do so for the following reasons:

> (a)     First, on the characterisation which the parties had adopted in calculation the 6 month period where parties were taken to “have lived with each other”, I did not consider it plainly obvious, at least on affidavit, that the defendant had conclusively established this. On parties’ affidavits in SUM 3856, the state of their cohabitation (if at all) is a hotly disputed and triable issue At best, I would state that the plaintiff would have an uphill task in seeking to establish how he could still rely on the specific events of adultery in light of the many interactions between himself and the defendant.

> (b)     On the extract of _Gabriel Peter_ I reproduced above (see \[48(h)\] above), a weak claim does not justify striking it out. Indeed, even the defendant acknowledges that ascertaining the truth of parties’ contentions of whether parties truly operated as though they belong to the same household (especially the statements made by the domestic helper in PW2) would require cross-examination. In short, it was not “plainly obvious” that the defendant’s reliance on section 95(5)(b) WC was without any answer.

> (c)     Second, I highlighted that the plaintiff’s narrative regarding the extra-marital affair (and the state of parties’ relationship thereafter) could apply to _both_ the unreasonable behaviour claim and adultery claim. So whilst it is arguable that the plaintiff might not be able to rely on the specific events of adultery for the adultery claim because of the time bar in section 95(5)(b) WC, no such time bar exists in respect of the unreasonable behaviour claim (see section 95(6) WC). To that extent, I was not prepared, in a manner of speaking, to throw the baby out with the bathwater. Indeed, I note that the defendant does not take the position that the plaintiff _cannot_ rely on paragraphs 1(b) to 1(t) SOP in respect of the unreasonable behaviour claim.

> (d)     Third, and something I alluded to at \[53(c)\] above, I was prepared to allow the paragraphs 1(b) to 1(t) SOP as primers to the plaintiff’s eventual elaboration of paragraph 1(u) SOP when further particulars of the continuing extramarital affair were provided.

67     For those reasons, I was not minded to strike out the adultery claim or paragraphs 1(b) to 1(u) SOP in its entirety, and accordingly dismissed Prayers 1 and 2 of SUM 3856.

### The Defendant’s tangential prayers

68     I now turn to the tangential prayers sought by the defendant in SUM 3856

#### Prayer 3 – Stay of proceedings pending disposal of SUM 3856

69     To recap, I made no orders to this particular prayer. I found it curious why the defendant had any issues with this order. As highlighted at \[22\] above, SUM 3890 had disposed with this particular prayer. Given that the defendant had obtained the stay in SUM 3890, there was no necessity to deal with this particular relief in SUM 3856. Prayer 3 in SUM 3856 had been overtaken by the orders made in SUM 3890. Accordingly, there was need to make any orders for those prayers.

70     Additionally, given that that I had already fully disposed of SUM 3856, there would no longer be any necessity for there to be a stay of the divorce proceedings.

#### Prayer 4 – Extension of time for Defendant to file and serve Defence and Counterclaim

71     Again, as I highlighted at \[22\] above, SUM 3890 granted the defendant and extension of time to file her Defence and Counterclaim. There was no longer any necessity for me to deal with this particular prayer for the purposes of SUM 3856. Accordingly, there was no need for me to make any orders on that prayer.

72     Perhaps giving the defendant the greatest benefit of doubt, the defendant’s dissatisfaction lies with her pedantic distinction between the prayers sought in SUM 3890 and SUM 3856. The prayer granted in SUM 3890 was an extension of time for the filing of the Defence and Counterclaim _in general_, whilst Prayer 3 in SUM 3856 was an extension of time to file the Defence and Counterclaim “after the Statement of Claim and Statement of Particulars herein have been amended to _exclude the parts to be struck out_…” (emphasis added). If the defendant’s dissatisfaction of the (non) order stems from the dismissal of her main striking out application, I have already given my reasons above.

#### Prayer 5 – Bar against interim judgment being entered until after the Statement of Claim and Statement of Particulars have been amended

73     To recap, Prayer 5 of SUM 3856 reads as follows:

> No interim judgment may be entered by the Plaintiff herein against the Defendant until 14 days after the Statement of Claim and Statement of Particulars herein have been amended to exclude the parts to be struck out or in such in the manner as may be directed by this Court;

74     I decided not to make any order to this prayer because after disposing of SUM 3856, I made directions for the amendment of the SOP, the filing of the defendant’s Defence and Counterclaim, as well as a status conference thereafter. Clearly, by making those directions, the divorce proceedings were back on track, and any determination (including an interim judgment, if any) would _only be determined at the end of the proceedings_. Accordingly, I decided it was not necessary to make any orders on this prayer.

75     But more importantly, by virtue of my directions, the defendant’s real intent was preserved insofar as the plaintiff could not attempt to seek a default judgment against the defendant. All things considered, the defendant actually obtained what she asked for.

76     Again, if the defendant’s real contention in appealing this decision is that I did not grant her striking out application, I have already stated my reasons above.

77     For those reasons, I made no orders to Prayers 3 to 5 of SUM 3856.

## Costs

78     Whilst not the subject of this appeal, and for completeness, I ordered that costs for this application be costs in the cause. After considering parties’ submissions, and while I saw no merit in the defendant’s application, I accepted that if not for the plaintiff’s less than ideal drafting (especially paragraph 1(u) SOP), the defendant might not have taken this application in the first place.

79     Ultimately, I considered that it would be more equitable for costs for this application be costs in the cause. If the plaintiff was ultimately successful in his divorce application on the amended pleadings, then this exercise would not have been in vain. If, on the other hand, the defendant succeeded in defending the adultery claim (or striking it out after all particulars are before the court), she should be entitled to the costs of her application.

80     I would close off by stating that perhaps on hindsight, and appreciating her position better, it would have been more prudent, especially given the existence of the unreasonable behaviour claim, for the defendant to properly crystallise her position by filing her Defence (and Counterclaim if applicable) at the relevant time. Thereafter, the issue of further and better particulars would necessarily have arisen. Instead, the defendant had, in my view, hastily commenced an improperly considered application.

## Conclusion

81     Finally, I wish to thank Ms Yap and Mr Peh for their assistance and submissions on this matter.
