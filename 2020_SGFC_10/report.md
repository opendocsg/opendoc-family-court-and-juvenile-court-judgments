Testamentary Capacity – Knowledge and Approval of will – Undue influence

30 January 2020 - Judgment reserved

### District Judge Yarni Loi:

## Introduction

1       This case involves a dispute between siblings over the will that an unmarried sibling had left behind when she passed away. The will was prepared and executed shortly after she had been diagnosed with Stage 4 breast cancer and she passed away about a month after she executed the will. The will was favourable to her youngest brother and his wife (the plaintiffs). Some of her other siblings now challenge the will.

2       At trial, it emerged that in the year leading up to the execution of the will, the siblings in the family had been embroiled in an unpleasant family dispute involving disagreements over the care of their ailing mother which spilled over into an exchange of lawyer’s letters. One of the elder siblings had issued a legal letter of demand to the late sister, the youngest brother and some other siblings, to request that they contribute financially towards Mother’s care. Family ties became strained and siblings estranged. Suffice to say, after this incident, their late sister did not speak to some of her siblings, although she remained close to her youngest brother and a younger sister. When she was diagnosed with cancer, she only informed the youngest brother and younger sister. They helped to look after her. She made them promise not to inform mother and the other siblings of her illness. They also did not inform mother and the other siblings of her death, which may not have been the kindest or the wisest decision. As things unfolded, mother and the other siblings came to know about her death through a third party about a month later. They were shocked and devastated. Mother would never see her daughter again and the siblings would never see their sister again. They did not have the chance to visit her one last time, to talk and perhaps tie up loose ends, to pay their last respects. Faced with a void of information, they scrambled to piece together what had happened by speaking to third parties. With what little information they managed to obtain and perspectives they strongly held, they concluded that their late sister, freshly diagnosed with Stage 4 breast cancer, could not have been in her right mind when she executed the will.

3       I can hardly imagine the depth of the shock, anguish and grief that mother and these other siblings must have felt when they heard news of their late sister’s death. However, I find that the allegations they have raised to challenge her will are based largely on hearsay, opinion and suspicion. I am satisfied, after carefully considering all the evidence adduced at trial, that their late sister had the mental capacity to execute the will, knew of and approved the will, and executed the will of her own volition.

## Background facts

4       The Testatrix, a Muslim, was 53 years old when she passed away from metastatic breast cancer on 26 January 2017. She had divorced her ex-husband, **Mhd Y**, on 31 August 2002 and they had no children. There is some evidence that he continued to live in her HDB flat in Serangoon, which is in her sole name (**Serangoon Flat**). She used to work as a restaurant supervisor.

5       Prior to her death, the Testatrix had executed a will on 27 December 2016 (**2016 Will**) bequeathing 1/3rd of her estate to the 2nd Plaintiff, the wife of her youngest brother, the 1st Plaintiff. The remaining 2/3rds would be distributed amongst her Mother and seven siblings in accordance with Muslim inheritance laws. Her main asset was her Serangoon Flat. Several siblings now challenge the 2016 Will.

6       Based on the Muslim Inheritance Certificate dated 9 February 2017 obtained from the Syariah Court, the distribution of the estate of the Testatrix under Muslim law would be in the following proportions: (a) Mother– 12 shares (b) 5 Brothers– 10 shares each = 50 shares (c) 2 Sisters– 5 shares each = 10 shares. Total = 72 shares.[^1]

### Family members and witnesses at trial

7       The siblings in the family, roughly in order of seniority[^2], are:

> (a)     The 4th Defendant. He is the eldest sibling. He does not appear to have been very close to the other siblings, but as he said, his door is always open for them, if they have problems.

> (b)     The 2nd Defendant. He did not enter an appearance to defend the suit. His whereabouts appear to be unknown to the family.

> (c)     The 6th Defendant. She is the eldest daughter. She is based in the United States (**States**) where she has been living for the past approximately 40 years. She is married and works as an Office Manager. She returns to Singapore for about 18 days every year during the Hari Raya festival period, when she reunites with the family at Mother’s place. She appears to have been the sibling who provided the greatest financial support to the family and their parents over the years.

> (d)     The 3rd Defendant. He did not enter an appearance to defend the suit. It is understood that he does not want to be involved in the Suit.

> (e)     The 5th Defendant. He is a hawker. He is about 2 years older than the Testatrix.

> (f)     The Testatrix.

> (g)     The 7th Defendant. She is based in the States where she is a housewife. She was very close to the Testatrix and they would speak to each other on the phone weekly. Although named as the 7th Defendant, she filed a draft consent order supporting the Plaintiffs’ claim.

> (h)     The 1st Plaintiff. He is an Engineer. He is the youngest son and the most highly educated of all the siblings. His wife, the 2nd Plaintiff, is a housewife. The elder siblings have alleged that the Plaintiffs were not close to Mother and did not visit her regularly. The 6th Defendant suspects that the Plaintiffs may hold a grudge because Mother did not agree to help look after one of their sons many years ago.

8       The Plaintiffs have started this action, asking that the court uphold the 2016 Will. Of the Defendants named in the action, only three of the Testatrix’s elder siblings, the 4th, 5th and 6th Defendants (collectively, **Disputants**), filed a Defence and Counterclaim to the Suit and gave evidence at trial. Their contention is that the 2016 Will is invalid and the entire estate should be distributed in accordance with Muslim inheritance laws. No other witnesses were called on behalf of the Disputants. Mother, named as the 1st Defendant, filed a Notice of Action to act in person but did not file a Defence and Counterclaim, nor did she give evidence at trial. The younger sister, the 7th Defendant, filed a draft Consent Order supporting the Plaintiffs’ claims and testified on behalf of the Plaintiffs. The other witnesses who testified on behalf of the Plaintiffs were Mr \[N\] (**Mr N**), the lawyer who had drafted and witnessed the execution of the 2016 Will, as well as Dr \[S\] (**Dr \[S\]**), Senior Consultant, Department of Medical Oncology, Tan Tock Seng Hospital (**TTSH**) who had seen the Testatrix in January 2017 before she passed away.

### Background - major falling out amongst siblings regarding Mother’s care in TTSH (“hospital incident”)

9       Sometime in early January 2016, Mother, who was already suffering from various ailments such as diabetes, heart disease and rheumatism, was hospitalised in TTSH after she suffered a stroke. The hospital apparently advised that she did not have long to live and should remain in hospital for a while. Mother however was in pain and in tears, and wanted to go home. The siblings who were initially present in the hospital when Mother was admitted had a huge disagreement over whether or not Mother should be discharged. The disagreement was particularly acrimonious and sharp between two brothers, the 1st Plaintiff and the 3rd Defendant. The 1st Plaintiff felt that Mother should continue to stay in hospital, whilst the 3rd Defendant was in favour of bringing Mother home. The two brothers quarrelled and almost came to physical blows in TTSH. The situation was very tense. The other siblings who were present at the time included the Testatrix and the 5th Defendant.

10     The 5th Defendant and the Testatrix called their eldest sibling (the 4th Defendant) and their eldest sister (the 6th Defendant) to inform them about their Mother’s situation in hospital. The 6th Defendant gave evidence that she made arrangements to fly back to Singapore immediately. When she arrived in Singapore on 13 January 2016, she went straight to hospital where she observed that Mother was in a very weak condition, pleading and crying to go home. Taking full control of the situation, she made arrangements for Mother to be discharged from hospital on 14 January 2016, even though some other siblings did not agree to this.

11     Thereafter, the 6th Defendant stayed on in Singapore for about one month to help to take care of Mother. She made sure arrangements were put in place to help Mother recuperate from her stroke, including engaging helpers and purchasing the necessary equipment to support Mother’s rehabilitation at home. She returned to the States after ensuring that Mother was settled and comfortable. According to the 6th Defendant, during this period, some of the siblings would come and visit Mother, including the 3rd and 4th Defendants. However, some of the siblings did not visit Mother. The latter camp included the Plaintiffs as well as the Testatrix. Prior to this incident, the Testatrix used to visit Mother very regularly. The 7th Defendant, who is based in the States, appears not to have been in Singapore during this period.

### The 6th Defendant sends lawyer’s letter of demand to siblings

12     The 6th Defendant testified that after Mother’s discharge, she tried to call some of her siblings, including the 1st Plaintiff, the Testatrix and the 7th Defendant, to discuss how they could help Mother, but they did not return her calls. According to the 6th Defendant, she had borne the bulk of the financial responsibility for looking after their parents in the past. She felt that it was time her siblings shared some of the financial responsibility.

13     Sometime in February 2016, she proceeded to instruct a law firm to send a letter of demand to some of her siblings including the 1st Plaintiff, the Testatrix and the 7th Defendant, to request that they share the financial responsibility for Mother’s care. She said the intent behind the letter was to “wake” the siblings up. She wanted them to come together to discuss how they could help Mother.

14     In response to the lawyer’s letter, she received a lawyer’s letter from the 1st Plaintiff to the effect that they did not agree to her demands. The 6th Defendant did not pursue the matter further. During cross-examination, the 6th Defendant agreed that her siblings might have been “upset” when they received her lawyer’s letter of demand.

### Sibling relationships and estrangements

15     None of the Disputants saw or spoke to the Testatrix again after the hospital incident and exchange of lawyer’s letters.

16     The Testatrix however remained close to her younger siblings, the 1st Plaintiff and 7th Defendant. The 1st Plaintiff says that he has always been close to the Testatrix even before her cancer diagnosis. He has produced text messages between the Testatrix and himself during the period 18 February 2016 to 31 December 2016. The text messages were primarily in English. They included warm and friendly messages to call and meet up, to enquire about each other and their health/families, to buy food etc.

17     The 6th Defendant believes that the Testatrix and the 1st Plaintiff did not use to be close, but may have grown closer because they had to talk to each other to discuss how to respond to her lawyer’s letter of demand in February 2016. Further, this followed on the heels of a Christmas holiday in the States in December 2015 when the Plaintiffs and Testatrix flew to the States at the invitation of the 6th Defendant to spend Christmas 2015 with her. The Testatrix accepted her invitation and spent Christmas 2015 in the States with the 6th Defendant, the 7th Defendant and their families. The Plaintiffs and their family also flew to the States at the same time, but spent most of their time in Disneyworld. The 6th Defendant believes that the 1st Plaintiff and Testatrix may have grown closer as a result of the trip to the States.

18     Based on the events and text messages, it seems clear to me that at least from the time of the hospital incident in January 2016 and lawyer’s letter in February 2016, if not even earlier, the Testatrix and 1st Plaintiff shared a strong and close sibling relationship.

19     It is also not disputed that the Testatrix was very close to her younger sister, the 7th Defendant. Even though the 7th Defendant was based in the States, they would speak to each other on the phone every week.

### 12 December 2016 – Testatrix is admitted to hospital

20     On 12 December 2016, the Testatrix was admitted to TTSH. The very same day, she texted the 1st Plaintiff to inform him that she had been hospitalised in TTSH.

21     A few days later, on 14 December, the Testatrix was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer. She informed the 1st Plaintiff of the diagnosis in a phone call that same day. The 1st Plaintiff would visit her and buy her food. Sometimes, the 2nd Plaintiff would accompany him.

22     On or about 21 December 2016, the Testatrix was discharged from TTSH. According to the discharge summary from TTSH, her “condition \[was\] better than at time of admission.” Based on the discharge note, she was given paracetamol, to be taken if she had “pain or fever.” [^3] The 1st Plaintiff continued to visit the Testatrix at her home in the evenings.

### Testatrix talks about making a Will

23     The 1st Plaintiff says that after she was diagnosed with breast cancer, the Testatrix told him that she wanted to make a will. She said she wanted to give him all her assets because he was close to her and had helped take care of her. He says that he was surprised at first because he considered it his duty to take care of her and told her to consider how she truly wished to deal with her assets. When she maintained that she wanted to give him her assets, he suggested that she speak to a lawyer for advice on Muslim inheritance laws. The Testatrix agreed and asked him to help her look for a suitable lawyer.

### Arrival of 7th Defendant in Singapore

24     When the Testatrix was diagnosed with breast cancer, she also informed the 7th Defendant. The 7th Defendant gave evidence that as soon as she learnt the news, she made arrangements to fly back to Singapore to spend time with the Testatrix. Both the 1st Plaintiff and the 7th Defendant gave evidence that the Testatrix told them not to inform Mother and the other siblings about her illness.

25     On the morning of 24 December 2016, the 7th Defendant arrived in Singapore where she stayed with the 1st Plaintiff. After her arrival, the 7th Defendant and the Plaintiffs would visit the Testatrix every day and keep her company. They would drive to the Serangoon Flat in the morning and have breakfast with the Testatrix in a nearby coffee shop before bringing her to the 1st Plaintiff’s home where they would spend time with her, chat with her, cook and eat. In the evening, they would drop her back at her Serangoon Flat. The 7th Defendant testified that whenever they visited the Testatrix, she would walk unaided to open the flat gate for them. She only used a wheelchair when she went out, for example, to the lawyer’s office.

26     The 7th Defendant gave evidence that during one of her visits to the Testatrix, the Testatrix told her that she wanted to make a will and planned to give all her assets to the 1st Plaintiff. As the Testatrix was very close to the 7th Defendant, she wanted to know if the 7th Defendant was fine with her decision. The 7th Defendant assured her that she was fine with it. According to the 7th Defendant, this was not the first time the Testatrix had spoken about making a will; several years ago, the Testatrix mentioned that she was thinking about making a will, although she did not mention any details.

### 27 Dec 2016 – Meeting at the lawyer’s office and execution of the will

27     On 27 December 2016, the Plaintiffs and the 7th Defendant arrived at the Serangoon Flat in the morning and had breakfast with the Testatrix in a nearby coffee shop. They chatted with the Testatrix as they normally did, and the Testatrix and the 2nd Plaintiff exchanged food recipes. Over breakfast, the 1st Plaintiff also informed the Testatrix that he had managed to help her make an appointment with a lawyer, Mr N, that day.

28     At around 2pm that day, the Plaintiffs, the 7th Defendant and the Testatrix took a taxi to Mr N’s office. When they arrived, all four of them entered Mr N’s office-cubicle which could accommodate about 8 seats. The office-cubicle was located in a wider office area; it was separated from the rest of the office area with a half glass partition. The Testatrix was in a wheelchair.

29     Mr N testified that during the meeting, the Testatrix told him that she wanted to give all her assets to her brother, the 1st Plaintiff, as he and his wife had been helping her. Mr N explained to her that as a Muslim, she was bound by the Muslim law of inheritance and could not make a will to deny, reduce or increase the shares of her estate which her lawful beneficiaries were entitled to. She could, however, make a bequest of up to 1/3rd of her estate to persons who were not her lawful beneficiaries. Hence, she could consider making a bequest of 1/3rd of her estate to the 1st Plaintiff’s wife or children, if it was her intention to provide more for him. The Testatrix instructed him to draft a will to give 1/3rd of her estate to the 2nd Plaintiff.

30     After the Testatrix had given her instructions, the Plaintiffs and the 7th Defendant were asked to leave Mr N’s office-cubicle. They waited outside at the sofa area in the main office area which was about 6 feet away from the office-cubicle.

31     Alone with the Testatrix, Mr N drafted the will in English and went through it with the Testatrix. After the will was prepared, Mr N’s office called one **Mr R** whose office was nearby, to witness the signing of the will (**2016 Will**). The Testatrix signed the 2016 Will before Mr N and Mr R.

32     Under the 2016 Will:

> (a)     The 1st Plaintiff was appointed sole executor and trustee of the will.

> (b)     1/3rd of the residue estate would be given to the 2nd Plaintiff.

> (c)     The remaining 2/3rds of the residue estate would be distributed to the estate’s beneficiaries in accordance with the Islamic law of Inheritance.

33     After the meeting at Mr N’s office which took roughly 1.5 hours, the Plaintiffs, the 7th Defendant and the Testatrix took a taxi back to the Serangoon Flat. During the taxi ride back, the Testatrix shared with them the contents of the 2016 Will.

### 17 January 2017– Testatrix is re-admitted to hospital

34     On or about 17 January 2017, the Testatrix’s condition worsened and she was re-admitted to hospital. Based on a medical report dated 7 September 2018 by Dr S who was involved in the care of the Testatrix from 18 to 24 January 2017, the Testatrix was initially supposed to undergo anti-cancer treatment but on 19 January 2017, a decision was made not to proceed with it because of her worsening liver function. On 23 January 2017, she exhibited fluctuating consciousness and on 24 January 2017, palliative care took over.

> “I got involved in \[the Testatrix’s\] care on the 18/1/2017…

> I had agreed with my registrar’s … plan to proceed with palliative treatment consisting of weekly Herceptin and weekly taxol (doses reduced).

> Her **MRI brain on 17.1.17 did not show brain pathology. Her liver function tests including bilirubin started to worsen but no signs of congenital impairment were documented and she was keen to start treatment.** She was made aware that the anticancer treatment is likely to have little effect.

> She was referred to palliative care on 19/1/17 and break through morphine was prescribed for pain. **On the 19.1.17 \[the Testatrix\] was informed that in view of her worsening liver function tests the planned anticancer treatment could not be given and she agreed to best supportive care**.

> **\[The Testatrix\] was noted to exhibit fluctuating consciousness on 23.1.17.**

> **On 24.1.17 \[the Testatrix\] was noted to become lethargic, inattentive and was staring into space. Palliative care took over her care on 24/1/17**. \[The Testatrix\] did not receive any active anti-cancer therapy at all. My input into \[the Testatrix’s\] care ended on 24.1.17”

> \[Emphasis added.\]

### 26 January 2017 – Testatrix passes away

35     On 26 January 2017, the Testatrix passed away in hospital. The 1st Plaintiff and the 7th Defendant were at her bedside. Thereafter, the 1st Plaintiff organised the funeral arrangements with the help of the 2nd Plaintiff. The 7th Defendant gave evidence that about seven persons attended the funeral, including the Plaintiffs, herself, Mhd Y and his sister, and an uncle and an aunt.

36     Mother and the other siblings were not informed of the Testatrix’s illness nor her passing. The 1st Plaintiff and the 7th Defendant gave evidence that the Testatrix had made them promise not to inform Mother or any of the other siblings. They believe she could have been concerned about telling Mother because of Mother’s own ill health. As for the other siblings, she may not have wanted to inform them because of the falling out in early 2016 after the hospital incident. At trial, the 6th Defendant conceded that after she sent the lawyer’s letter, her siblings did not want to speak to her. When asked why the Testatrix did not inform her about her illness, she replied that it was the “prerogative” of the Testatrix. The 1st Plaintiff gave evidence that he had planned to tell Mother himself of the Testatrix’s death.

### About a month later –siblings learn about the death of the Testatrix

37     About a month later, sometime on or around 28 February 2017, the 5th Defendant’s friend, **Mhd X**, told the 5th Defendant that the Testatrix had passed away. The Testatrix’s ex-husband, Mhd Y, was a mutual friend of both Mhd X and the 5th Defendant. The 5th Defendant was shocked and called the 4th and 6th Defendants to inform them. The 6th Defendant gave evidence that when she received the call in the States, she had actually just left Singapore. She had travelled to Singapore on around 30 January 2017 to visit Mother and stayed until 14 February 2017. She was shocked to hear that when she was in Singapore, the Testatrix had already passed away and she had no inkling.

38     In around June 2017, the 6th Defendant travelled to Singapore again to visit Mother for Hari Raya. She also arranged for some of the family members, including Mother and the 3rd and 4th Defendants, to meet Mhd Y, in an attempt to find out what had happened to the Testatrix.

### Testatrix’s ex-husband, Mhd Y

39     Mhd Y was the Testatrix’s ex-husband. At trial, the 4th Defendant gave evidence that the family disapproved of Mhd Y and the Testatrix’s marriage to him had caused family tensions. The Testatrix and Mhd Y eventually divorced. Some of the siblings said that the Testatrix and Mhd Y subsequently reconciled and re-married in Batam, Indonesia, although they did not produce any evidence of this supposed re-marriage. What is clear is that Mhd Y appears to have continued to stay in the Serangoon Flat. According to the 4th Defendant, there were problems between the Testatrix and Mhd Y.

40     The meeting that the 6th Defendant arranged with Mhd Y lasted a few hours. According to the Disputants, the gist of what Mhd Y told them was the following: (a) He felt guilty about not informing them about the death of the Testatrix. He said that the 1st Plaintiff had instructed him not to tell Mother and the other siblings, and that he would personally convey the news. (b) The Testatrix had fallen ill with Stage 4 cancer and had been admitted to hospital in December 2016. She was in a very poor condition, in a wheelchair, with a tube stuck into her. Because of her tiredness and medication, she was sometimes forgetful and not aware of what was going on. (c) During her first hospital admission in December, he claimed to be the only person who looked after her in hospital. However, after the Testatrix was discharged and the 1st Plaintiff was informed of her condition, the 1st Plaintiff took over control of the Testatrix. The Plaintiffs took the Testatrix out every day and brought her home only in the evening when she was very tired. (d) The Plaintiffs brought her to the lawyer’s office and kept him in the dark about the 2016 Will. (e) When the Testatrix was admitted to hospital the second time in January, the 1st Plaintiff told hospital staff not to allow Mhd Y visit the Testatrix. (f) Immediately after she passed away, the 1st Plaintiff and a cousin visited the Serangoon Flat and took the Testatrix’s belongings. They also asked Mhd Y to leave the flat immediately and hand them the house-keys. (**Mhd Y’s Allegations**).

41     At this point, I have to state that Mhd Y’s Allegations are hearsay. According to the 5th Defendant, the Disputants tried to locate Mhd Y to give evidence at the trial, but were unable to locate him.[^4] The 4th Defendant, sought to introduce a Statutory Declaration dated 27 December 2017 purportedly signed by Mhd Y (**SD**) by filing a Supplementary List of Documents annexing the SD. The SD contained hearsay and opinion evidence and sought to introduce an account of what the Mhd Y had apparently told the Disputants. On the first day of trial, I ruled that the SD was inadmissible. It had not been properly admitted into evidence pursuant to section 32 of the Evidence Act, read with Rule 592 of the Family Justice Rules.

### The shock and devastation of Mother and other siblings

42     The Disputants were shocked and devastated over the death of their late sister. They were particularly upset that the Plaintiffs had kept Mother in the dark as the Testatrix had a close relationship with Mother and used to visit her regularly before the unfortunate family dispute in early 2016. After making enquiries with a law firm, the Disputants learnt about the 2016 Will.

## Court filings

43     On 11 July 2017, the Plaintiffs applied for a Grant of Probate by way of FC/P xxx/2017 pursuant to the 2016 Will. On 13 September 2017, the 4th Defendant applied for a caveat by way of FC/CAVP xx/2017 challenging the validity of the 2017 Will. Thereafter, on 26 December 2017, the Plaintiffs filed this action, praying for the following:

> (i)     That the court decree probate of the will in solemn form in law.

> (ii)     That the court cease effect the caveat lodged vide FC/CAVP xx/2017.

> (iii)     That leave be granted to the Plaintiffs to extract the Grant of Probate of the Will vide FC/P xxx/2017.

> (iv)     Costs.

44     On 27 February 2018, the 5th and 6th Defendants filed their Defence and Counterclaim through the same lawyer, Mr James Joseph. On 15 March 2018, the 4th Defendant filed his Defence and Counterclaim with a different lawyer, Mr John Tay.

45     In their Defence and Counterclaim, the Disputants allege that the Testatrix who had only been diagnosed with 4th stage breast cancer on 14 December 2016 and who had passed away slightly more than a month, could not have had testamentary capacity to execute the 2016 Will. Further and/or alternatively, that she did not know or approve of the will and/or was unduly influenced by the Plaintiffs who had misled, induced or tricked her into signing it. They argue that the Testatrix was close to Mother who was ill and required financial help, and there was no reason why the Testatrix would want to give 1/3rd of her estate to the 2nd Plaintiff and deprive Mother of a greater share under Islamic inheritance laws.

46     I should add that the Defendants had initially argued that the 2016 Will was not in accordance with Muslim Law as the Testatrix could not bequeath 1/3rd of her estate to the 2nd Plaintiff. However, on the first day of trial, both Mr Tay and Mr Joseph confirmed that the Disputants conceded that the 2016 Will did not contravene Muslim inheritance laws and the 2nd Plaintiff would be entitled to 1/3rd of the estate, if the 2016 Will was found to be valid.

## Issues

47     It is settled law that the legal burden of propounding a will lies upon the party propounding the will, and that the issues that fall to be determined when the validity of a will are called into question are:

> (a)     Whether the testator had the testamentary capacity to execute the will?

> (b)     Whether the testator knew and approved of the contents of the will?

> (c)     Whether the testator was free from undue influence or the effects of fraud?

## Issue 1 – The Mind of the Testatrix: Did the Testatrix have testamentary capacity?

### (a)   The law on testamentary capacity

48     A person possessing testamentary capacity:

> (a)     understands the nature of the act of executing a will and its consequences;

> (b)     knows the extent of his property of which he is disposing;

> (c)     knows who his beneficiaries are and can appreciate their claims to his property; and

> (d)     is free from an abnormal state of mind (eg. delusions) that might distort feelings or judgments relevant to making the will. A testator is deprived of testamentary capacity only where his mind is so dominated by the insane delusion that he is unable to exercise judgment in disposing of his property reasonably and properly, or of taking a rational view of the matters to be considered in making a will.

49     In determining testamentary capacity, the courts are guided by the following well-established legal principles:

> (a)     The propounder of a will bears the legal burden of proving testamentary capacity.

50     In the seminal Court of Appeal case of **_Chee Mu Lin Muriel v Chee Ka Lin Caroline (Chee Ping Chian Alexander and another, interveners)_** <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGCA 27</span> (“**_Muriel Chee_**”) the testatrix, T, made 2 wills before her death. In 1989, she made the first will, the 1989 Will, which favoured the respondent, her favourite daughter. From 1995 onwards, T became unwell and was diagnosed with a host of illnesses including Parkinson’s and dementia, depression and Alzheimer’s, vascular dementia, and progressively poor memory loss. She was also prescribed an increasing number of drugs and had a fall on 10 August 1996. A few days after the fall, the appellant-daughter arranged for a lawyer, MO, a family relative, to meet T and prepare a will for T, which sought to be fair to T’s other children. MO prepared a will, the 1996 Will, based on the appellant-daughter’s instructions. The trial judge held that the 1996 Will was invalid. The decision was affirmed by the CA. The CA found, _inter alia_, that the appellant-daughter had not discharged the burden of proving that T had requisite testamentary capacity. The CA set out the relevant principles as follows:

> “\[37\]  **The relevant principles are established. For a will to be found valid, the testator must (a) have the mental capacity to make a will; (b) have knowledge and approval of the contents of the will; and (c) be free from undue influence or the effects of fraud**. The leading authority in this area of the law is the decision in Banks v Goodfellow (1870) LR 5 QB 549 (“Banks”) which has been followed by our courts. **The essential requisites of testamentary capacity were recently stated in** **_George Abraham Vadakathu v Jacob George_** **\[2009\] 3 SLR (R) at \[29\] as follows: (a) the testator understands the nature of the act and what its consequences are; (b) he knows the extent of his property of which he is disposing; (c) he knows who his beneficiaries are and can appreciate their claims to his property; and (d) he is free form an abnormal state of mind (eg delusions) that might distort feelings or judgments relevant to making the will**.

> \[38\]  The Judge has helpfully restated the law that in applying the test in _Banks_, the court must look at the totality of the evidence as a whole, comprising of both factual (including evidence of friends and relatives who had the opportunity to observe the testator) and medical components. The court should generally accord equal importance and weight to both types of evidence, so long as both the factual and medical witnesses had the opportunity to observe the testator at the material time…

> \[40\]   **The propounder of the will bears the burden of proving that the testator possessed testamentary capacity. This will prima facie be established by the due execution of the will in ordinary circumstances where the testator was not known to be suffering from any kind of mental disability. An indication of testamentary capacity would be the rationality of the will having regard to its terms and the identities of the beneficiaries**… The party challenging the will may rebut this presumption by adducing evidence to the contrary, such as evidence that the testator was suffering from a mental illness that was serious enough for the court to find that the testator lacked testamentary capacity.”

> \[Emphasis added.\]

51     In **_Ng Bee Keong v Ng Choon Huay and others_** <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGHC 107</span> (“**_Ng Bee Keong_**”), the testator, T, passed away on 31 May 2009 from cancer. Before his death, on 14 May 2009, he had executed a will, the 2009 Will, appointing the plaintiff-nephew with whom he had a close relationship, as sole executor and beneficiary of his entire estate. Two of T’s siblings challenged the 2009 Will. They argued that it was not in T’s nature to make a will; the circumstances leading up to the execution of the 2009 Will were suspicious; and it was not translated into a language that the testator could read and understand. The judge rejected their arguments and upheld the 2009 Will. On the issue of testamentary capacity, the judge held that the 2009 Will was rational and the presumption of testamentary capacity operated. The defendants had also not adduced sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption. Even though T was not highly educated, he was financially astute and kept detailed accounts of his income and expenses. The defendants had failed to adduce sufficient evidence that T did not know the extent of his estate which was not complex, and failed to show that the testator did not know his beneficiaries and their claims to his properties after his death. Justice Andrew Ang summarised the relevant principles as follows:

> “\[44\]  **It is settled law that the legal burden of proving that the testator possessed testamentary capacity lies on the party propounding the will. However, testamentary capacity is generally presumed where the will appears to be rational on its face and is duly executed in ordinary circumstances by a testator not known to be suffering from any kind of mental disability** (see _Muriel Chee_ at \[40\]). The party challenging the will may then rebut this presumption by adducing evidence to the contrary…

> \[119\] … **I find that on the balance of probabilities it is unlikely that the testator felt any moral obligation to make provision for his other relatives. Even if his decision to exclude his other relatives might appear uncaring, it certainly could not be said to be irrational. Further, I find that his choice of the plaintiff as the sole beneficiary of his will appears rational** in light of his close relationship with the plaintiff and his confidence that the plaintiff would not squander his estate…..

> \[120\]  **Since the will is rational on its face and was duly executed in ordinary circumstances by a testator not known to be suffering from any kind of mental disability, I find that the presumption of testamentary capacity arises. As such the burden of rebutting this presumption falls on the defendants** who would need to adduce evidence that the _Banks_ criteria …were not met by the testator….”

52      **_Yeo Henry (executor and trustee of the estate of Ng Lay Hua, deceased) v Yeo Charles and others_** <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 220</span> **(“****_Henry Yeo_****”)** involved the estate of an 88 year old matriarch, T, who passed away in March 2013 leaving behind 4 children including her eldest son and his two children (the defendants) and her favourite younger son (plaintiff). In 2002, she had executed a will, the 2002 Will, under which the eldest son’s two children, the defendants, would receive a property each. However, the defendants were written out of her subsequent wills, including the latest, the 2012 Will, where the plaintiff was named as the sole executor and principal beneficiary of her estate. The defendants argued that T did not have testamentary capacity to execute the 2012 Will. She was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2004, had fallen in the bathroom in 2006, was warded in hospital in 2006 with intermittent seizures, and was treated for depression from August 2006. The trial judge disagreed with the defendants and upheld the 2012 Will. Even though the presumption of testamentary capacity did not arise because of T’s severe mental depression, the judge held that there was evidence that she possessed testamentary capacity. She was free of an abnormal state of mind (eg delusions) and was not suffering from dementia, and was neither delirious nor confused. Her lawyer gave evidence about her mental state and conduct in executing the 2012 Will and her ability to engage in social exchange. The will was also consistent with the plaintiff being her favourite son, and she had earlier made known her intention to remove the defendants from her will. SJ Andrew Ang held:

> “\[47\] It is settled law that the legal burden of proving that the testator possessed testamentary capacity falls on the party propounding the will. However, **testamentary capacity is generally presumed where the will appears to be rational on its face and was duly executed in ordinary circumstances by a testator not known to be suffering from any kind of mental disability**… In such a case, the evidential burden of proving unsoundness of mind shifts to the party alleging it.

> \[48\]   **If during the period prior to the execution of this will the testator suffered from serious mental illness, a presumption arises that it continued and the testator lacked testamentary capacity**. This presumption may be rebutted by the person propounding the will by establishing that the testator made the will during a lucid interval or after recovery from the illness…. **Lest it be misunderstood that any form of mental illness will suffice to raise this presumption, it should be pointed out that it can only arise where such serious mental illness is sufficient to cause testamentary incapacity**….”

53     In a recent High Court case, **_ULV v ULW_** <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 1270</span> (“**ULV**”), Justice Tan Puay Boon summarised the principles on testamentary capacity as follows:

> “\[25\]  **The propounder of a will bears the legal burden of proving testamentary capacity** (Muriel Chee at \[40\]). The essential requisites of testamentary capacity are that: (a) the testator understands the nature of the act and what its consequences are; (b) he knows the extent of his property of which he is disposing; (c) he knows who his beneficiaries are and can appreciate their claims to his property; and (d) he is free from an abnormal state of mind (eg delusions) that might distort feelings or judgments relevant to making the will. (Muriel Chee at \[37\], citing Banks v Goodfellow (1870) LR 5 QB 549 (“Banks v Goodfellow”) at 565). As regards the first requirement, the testator need not be able to “view his will with the eye of a lawyer” or “comprehend its provisions in their legal form”; it suffices if “he has such a mind and memory as well enable him to understand the elements of which it is composed, and the disposition of his property in its simple forms” (Banks v Goodfellow at 567). **It should also be noted that the capacity to make a will may vary depending on the complexity of the testator’s affairs and family situation, and on whether the will is a simple or complicated one**. This is stated in Theobald on Wills, a treatise cited by the appellant, at para 3-002, and is further supported by Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore vol 15 (Lexis Nexis, 2016 Reissue) (“Halsbury’s”) at para 190.190. **In determining testamentary capacity, the court must consider the totality of the evidence as a whole, including both the factual component (including evidence of friends and relatives who had the opportunity to observe the testator) and the medical component**, and generally accord equal weight to both types of evidence so long as both the factual and medical witnesses had the opportunity to observe the testator at the material time (Muriel Chee at \[38\]).

> \[26\]   **Testamentary capacity will generally be presumed when the will was duly executed in ordinary circumstances where the testator was not known to be suffering from any kind of mental disability. One indication of testamentary capacity is the rationality of the will**, having regard to its terms and the identities of the beneficiaries (Muriel Chee at \[40\], citing George Abraham Vadakathu v Jacob George \[2009\] 3 SLR (R) at \[33\] – \[36\] and \[67\]). **Theobald on Wills states at para 3-010 that if a duly executed will is rational on its face, the testator is presumed to have had testamentary capacity**.”

> \[Emphasis added.\]

### (b)   Presumption of testamentary capacity arises in this case

54     The Disputants argue that the presumption of testamentary capacity does not arise because the 2016 Will is irrational. Further, that the 2016 Will was not executed in ordinary circumstances where the Testatrix was not suffering from any known mental disability, but highly suspicious circumstances when the Testatrix was “on the verge of death” and unable to make decisions of any kind.

55     Whilst I acknowledge the Disputants’ anguish over being kept in the dark about their late sister’s death, I am unable to agree with their arguments. I am satisfied that the presumption of testamentary capacity arises in this case.

#### (i)   2016 Will appears rational

56     The Disputants argue that the 2016 Will was not rational. From their perspective, the Testatrix was not close to the Plaintiffs. At trial, the Disputants made various allegations along the lines that the Testatrix was “not fond” of the 2nd Plaintiff who only cared for herself and had treated the Testatrix poorly in the past. Further, they allege that the Plaintiffs did not care about Mother and did not visit her unlike other siblings. It was therefore unfathomable to them that the Testatrix would give 1/3rd of her estate to the 2nd Plaintiff.

57     Whilst I recognise that the Disputants do not feel much goodwill towards the Plaintiffs for various reasons, I am not persuaded by their arguments. At trial, Mr N gave evidence that the Testatrix initially wanted to give the 1st Plaintiff all her assets, but after listening to his advice on Muslim inheritance laws as well as her options, decided to bequeath 1/3rd of her estate to the 2nd Plaintiff. Under cross-examination, Mr N testified as follows:

> Cross-examination by Mr Tay [^5] :

> “A:    In this case.. I recollect that the testator wanted to give her assets to her brother who was ..at the session, in the room with her. I advised her that as a Muslim, she could not do that. I also advised her that at the maximum, she could give 1/3 of her assets to someone who is not a beneficiary under the Muslim law. I suggested if she wanted to give her brother more than his share as a beneficiary under the Muslim law, she could instead give up to 1/3 to her brother’s wife or his children and in that way, she would be giving him more than his allotted share under the Muslim law…..

> Cross-examination by Mr James Joseph[^6]

> Q:    Did she tell you why she is giving 1/3 of her property to her sis in law?

> A:    It was upon my advice that if she wanted to give a larger portion to her brother, she could do so by giving 1/3 of her estate to his children or to his wife. So she decided that she wanted to give the full 1/3 to his wife.

> Q:    Did she tell you why she doesn’t want to give to her own mother or to other siblings?

> A:    I don’t recollect that… I do recall that she said that her brother and his wife were the persons who were helping her the most. But I do not recollect whether she made unkind remarks about any other family members.”

58     I find the Testatrix’s instructions to Mr N perfectly rational. The Disputants main argument centres on the supposedly poor relationship that the Testatrix allegedly had with the Plaintiffs. However, the Disputants would not have any personal and direct knowledge of the relationship between the Testatrix and the Plaintiffs at the material time. In fact, the Testatrix had not spoken to any of the Disputants, nor visited Mother, since the hospital incident in January 2016. The 6th Defendant’s own evidence is that her relationship with the Testatrix, prior to the hospital incident, was neutral; they did not talk much to each other as the 6th Defendant was based in the States, although she did invite the Testatrix to spend Christmas in the States with her family and the 7th Defendant’s family in 2015.[^7] Critically, the 6th Defendant did not see or speak to the Testatrix since the family dispute in early 2016.[^8] The 6th Defendant testified that after she arranged for Mother’s discharge, some of her siblings did not speak to her and did not return her calls.[^9] Further, she acknowledged that after she sent the lawyer’s letter of demand in February 2016, the recipients might be upset. She testified[^10]:

> Q:    ..But if I suggest to you that if you were to receive a letter of demand from your other siblings, would … the relationship be normal anymore after that?

> A:     **They might be upset, but I don’t know … they going to disown me, that I cannot tell you**.

> ….

> Q:    Alright. My suggestion is that because of the letter that you have sent… \[the Testatrix\] then didn’t get along with you after that particular date. And that is the reason why she chose not to update you herself as regard to her medical condition.

> A:    Incorrect… If this is in 2016, **so most probably she is upset because of course everybody is going to be upset**. **And when people are upset, they would – they normally make wrong decision**….”

> \[Emphasis added.\]

59     Similarly, the 5th Defendant did not see the Testatrix after the January 2016 hospital incident. The 5th Defendant gave evidence that he used to have a close relationship with the Testatrix. They would meet weekly at Mother’s place and call each other if they had problems. However, he believes that the last time he saw the Testatrix was during the 2016 hospital incident. After that incident, when he attempted to call her, she did not answer his calls. As for the 4th Defendant, he admitted that he did not have a close relationship with the Testatrix to begin with, and was unable to recall the last time he met her.

60     In contrast, the evidence shows that the relationship between the Testatrix and the Plaintiffs was not as depicted by the Disputants. The 1st Plaintiff gave evidence that he had always been close to the Testatrix, although he was not close to his other siblings. While I make no finding on how far back their good sibling relationship stretched, the text messages between the 1st Plaintiff and the Testatrix show that at least by February 2016, they had a close sibling relationship. They regularly exchanged friendly and warm text messages with each other. For example, they would text each other to call and/or to meet up; the Testatrix would also ask him about his family, while he would ask her about her job interview, her new job and her leg; he also wished her happy belated birthday on 22 November 2016.[^11]

61     As for the 2nd Plaintiff, I accept the Disputants’ evidence that the Testatrix had confided to them, in the past, that she was “not fond” of her and perhaps even did not like her. However, relationships between family members, including (or especially) with in-laws, are fluid and dynamic; and can change over time. In this case, I also expect that the Testatrix’s close relationship with the 1st Plaintiff from at least February 2016 would have had a positive impact on her relationship with the 2nd Plaintiff. There is evidence that the sisters-in-law exchanged a casual text exchange on 22 May 2016 where the Testatrix reminded the 2nd Plaintiff to call one “kak mas”.[^12] In any event, it is the nature of the Testatrix’s relationship with the 1st Plaintiff which is important, as the intent behind the 2016 Will was to give him a greater share of the assets.

62     After the cancer diagnosis, the 1st Plaintiff continued to visit the Testatrix, care for her and buy her food. When she was first admitted to hospital on 12 December 2016, she texted him the very same day to update him that she was in TTSH and gave him her hospital bed number. She also updated him on changes to her hospital bed, and regularly texted him to help buy her different types of food, for example, soto ayam, chendol, briyani fish or mutton, chicken rice, soup and nasi rending. After she was discharged on 21 December, they continued to exchange text messages and he would visit her in the evenings and buy her food. [^13] When he visited, he would put the 2nd Plaintiff on the phone so that she could talk to the Testatrix as well. After the 7th Defendant arrived in Singapore, the Plaintiffs and the 7th Defendant would visit the Testatrix in the morning for breakfast and spend the whole day with her before bringing her home in the evenings.

63     Given the family dynamics and sibling estrangements since the sibling dispute in early 2016, as well as the strong and good relationship between the Testatrix and the 1st Plaintiff, I find nothing irrational about the 2016 Will. I also accept the 1st Plaintiff’s evidence that the Testatrix had mentioned to him that she was worried that if her assets went to Mother, they would eventually go to the other siblings when Mother passed away.[^14]

#### (ii)   2016 Will executed under ordinary circumstances where Testatrix had no known mental disability

64     The Disputants also argue that the presumption of testamentary capacity should not arise because the 2016 Will was not executed under ordinary circumstances where the Testatrix was not suffering from any known mental disability, but under highly suspicious circumstances where the Testatrix was in extremely bad heath, slumped in a wheelchair and suffering from Stage 4 breast cancer. She was, they argue, on the “verge of death” and unable to communicate with any party and/or not in a mental or physical state to make any decisions of any kind.

65     In support of their allegations, the Defendant rely principally on: (a) the fact of the Testatrix’s cancer diagnosis; (b) Mhd Y’s Allegations, namely, that the Testatrix was in a wheelchair with a tube, was very weak because of medication and had a poor memory and was forgetful[^15]; and (c) their own opinions. For instance, at trial, the 6th Defendant said that she had sought the opinion of her neighbours in the States, including a physician, neurologist and specialist, on the medical report of the Testatrix and they had told her that there was “no hope, she is dying”, and that the Testatrix “cannot make decision because everything is gone.”[^16]

66     At this point, it is necessary to parse fact from fiction. The fact that the Testatrix was suffering from Stage 4 cancer, needed the assistance of a wheelchair when she went to see the lawyer and was frail and tired easily, does not mean that she was suffering from mental disability. There is absolutely no evidence that the Testatrix was suffering from any mental disability or known history of mental illness at the time she executed the 2016 Will. The discharge summary from TTSH also showed that when she was discharged from hospital on 21 December, she was given only paracetamol for pain or fever, and no other medication for any mental disability or illness.[^17]

67     In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the presumption of testamentary capacity arises. The 2016 Will was rational on its face, and duly executed under ordinary circumstances where the Testatrix was not known to be suffering from any mental disability.

### (c)   Disputants have not adduced affirmative evidence to rebut the presumption

68     Further, the Disputants have not adduced affirmative evidence to rebut the presumption. Essentially, the Defendants rely on what Mhd Y allegedly told them about their late sister’s condition. However, as I explained above, that is hearsay. The fact that the Testatrix was suffering from stage 4 breast cancer does not mean that she was unable to make decisions in relation to the disposition of her assets. Furthermore, none of the Disputants actually saw the Testatrix at the material time leading up to, and during, her illness. In short, their case is not based on evidence, but on hearsay and speculation.

69     In any case, even if the presumption does not arise, I am satisfied that the evidence adduced by the Plaintiffs demonstrates that the Testatrix had the requisite testamentary capacity at the material time.

70     First, I find the evidence and testimony of Dr S helpful. The Testatrix had been admitted to hospital a second time from 17 January 2017 until she passed away on 27 January 2017. During that period, Dr S was involved in her care from 18 January 2017 to 24 January 2017. Even though Dr S was not a psychiatrist and could not give evidence as to her testamentary capacity to make a will, he gave helpful evidence that in the period when the Testatrix was under his care, her **decision-making capacity was normal prior to 23 January 2017**:[^18]

> (a)     she did not have any known history of mental illness;

> (b)     she was not receiving any anti-cancer treatment but only pain control medication when she admitted on 17 January 2017;

> (c)     an MRI of her brain on 17 January 2017 did not shown brain pathology and there were no signs of congenital impairment;

> (d)     during the period she was under his care, **her decision-making capacity with regards to her anti-cancer treatment was normal prior to 23 January 2017.** When Dr S saw her on 18 January 2017 to discuss her treatment options, she understood the reasons why they were planning chemotherapy. She did not exhibit any difficulty in understanding her medical treatment options. At trial, Dr S explained that cancer treatment is “dependent on the decision-making capacity of a patient understanding the pros and cons of chemotherapy in their current situation or anti-cancer treatment.” She was made aware that anti-cancer treatment was likely to have little effect, but was keen to start treatment. Unfortunately, the planned anti-cancer treatment was eventually not administered because of her worsening liver condition.

> (e)     Her **decision making capacity was impaired only from 23 January 2017 onwards**. On 23 January 2017, she was noted to exhibit fluctuating consciousness and on 24 January, she became lethargic, inattentive and was staring into space. In other words, she was not responding to questions asked and not making sense of what she was asked. Palliative care took over on 24 January 2017.

71     The lawyer, Mr N, also gave clear and unwavering evidence that the Testatrix was fully capable of making decisions regarding the 2016 Will. He was an independent lawyer with no prior knowledge of, and no personal or professional relationship with, the Testatrix and the Plaintiffs who were not previously his clients and who have not given him instructions on any other matters since.

72     At the outset, I have to say that it is highly unfortunate that Mr N was unable to locate his handwritten case notes for his meeting with the Testatrix. He testified that he typically files his case notes, together with the office copy of the will, in his “wills file” for the year, but was not able to locate the case notes for this case. He was only able to produce a copy of a page of his diary reflecting the Testatrix’s appointment at his office. Given that the meeting took place more than 3 years ago, his recollection of the meeting with the Testatrix was therefore not ideal. Nonetheless, he came across as an honest and straightforward witness, with no reason to be untruthful. Although he was not able to recall the details of the meeting well, he was clear on the instructions that the Testatrix had given him in this particular case because “this case was unusual for two reasons. One is that she was suffering from medical condition which was incurable, and two that she wanted to give all her assets to her brother. So those things stand out clearly.”[^19]

73     I accept Mr N’s evidence on the following:

> (a)     When the Testatrix came to his office-cubicle, she was in a wheelchair and accompanied by some family members. The Testatrix informed him that she had cancer and was not expected to live much longer. She wanted to give all her assets to her brother, the 1st Plaintiff, as he and his wife had been helping her.[^20]

> (b)     Mr N explained to her that as a Muslim, she could not do that. She was bound by the Muslim law of Inheritance and could not make a will to deny, reduce or increase the shares of her estate which her lawful beneficiaries were entitled to. She could, however, make a bequest of up to a maximum of 1/3rd of her estate to persons who were not her lawful beneficiaries under Muslim law. He suggested that if she wanted to give her brother more than his share as beneficiary under Muslim law, she could give up to 1/3rd to the brother’s wife or children in that way, she would be giving him more than his allotted share under Muslim law.[^21] As per his general practice, he would have checked on her assets and asked about the beneficiaries.[^22]

> (c)     The Testatrix proceeded to instruct him to draw up the will to bequeath 1/3rd of her estate to the 2nd Plaintiff. Thereafter, the persons accompanying the Testatrix left Mr N’s office-cubicle and waited in the sofa area in the main office which was about 6 feet away.

> (d)     The Testatrix was alone with Mr N in his office-cubicle when he drafted the will. Mr N then went through the draft with her. After the Testatrix confirmed the contents of the draft, Mr N engrossed the 2016 Will. Mr N’s law firm then called Mr R to come and witness the signing. The Testatrix then signed the will in presence of Mr N and Mr R. In view of her medical condition, and to save her the inconvenience of having to return to the office for signing another day, the 2016 Will was prepared and executed on the same day she gave her instructions.

> (e)     The Testatrix was clear in the way she spoke and how she wanted her will to be drawn up. She did tell him that she had cancer and it was likely to be fatal. However, there was no indication that she may not have had the testamentary capacity to make the will. She did not appear to be in pain or feeling the effects of any medication.[^23]

> (f)     When cross-examined on why he did not request for a psychiatrist report on her testamentary capacity, he explained that it was not his practice to require all his clients to undergo psychiatric assessment. He only required clients to obtain a psychiatric opinion if he was uncertain as to their mental capacity or if the client was an aged client. In this case, there was no need for a psychiatric opinion as the Testatrix was clearly capable of making a will and expressed herself very clearly.[^24]

74     Mr N’s evidence corroborates the evidence of the Plaintiffs. According to the 1st Plaintiff, the Testatrix was brought to the solicitors’ office in a wheel-chair but notwithstanding her frail health/that she tired easily, she was capable of making her own decisions. She was aware of her surroundings and understood what she was doing. Similarly, the 2nd Plaintiff testified that although the Testatrix had difficulties walking long distances, she was fully aware of what she was doing that day. In the morning, they spoke to each other as they normally would and exchanged food recipes. Later in the lawyer’s office, she was able to give clear instructions to the lawyer.

75     Importantly, the Plaintiffs’ evidence was corroborated by the 7th Defendant. The 7th Defendant did not have a good recollection of the details of the meeting at the lawyer’s office which was perhaps unsurprising due to the lapse of time. Nonetheless, she gave clear evidence that the Testatrix was in a good frame of mind to make a will and was clear about her wishes.[^25] The 7th Defendant also testified that after the meeting at the lawyer’s office and during the taxi ride back, the Testatrix shared the contents of the 2016 Will with them and said that those where her wishes.[^26]

76     The Disputants have contended that the 7th Defendant’s evidence should not be trusted because she was not upfront when questioned about whether she took the Testatrix’s jewellery and cash. Whilst I accept that the 7th Defendant did not give a straight answer about the Testatrix’s jewellery, she did explain that the Testatrix had passed her the ATM card and told her to use the card to pay for burial expenses. In any case, these matters relate to administration of the estate, and not the validity of the 2016 Will.

77     Of all the siblings, the 7th Defendant was closest to the Testatrix and they spoke to each other over the phone every week. She immediately arranged to fly down to Singapore when she heard that the Testatrix was ill. In the final analysis, her evidence cannot be said to be self-serving since the terms of the 2016 Will were actually disadvantageous to her.

### (d)   Conclusion on testamentary capacity

78     In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the presumption of testamentary capacity arises. Further and in any case, the evidence shows that the Testatrix had the requisite testamentary capacity to make the 2016 Will.

## Issue 2 – The Actions of the Testatrix: Whether the Testatrix had knowledge of and approved of the 2016 Will?

### (a)   The relevant legal principles

79     The following well-established legal principles apply to the second issue, whether the Testatrix knew and approved of the 2016 Will:

> (a)     Once testamentary capacity is established, a rebuttal presumption arises that the testator knew and approved the contents of the will (i.e. that the will reflects the true intentions of the testator) and the evidential burden shifts to the opponent of the will to rebut this presumption.

> (b)     This presumption, however, will not operate where there were circumstances attending or relating to the preparation and execution of the will which would raise a well-grounded suspicion that the will did not express the mind of the testator. Circumstances which have nothing to do with the preparation and execution of the will are to be disregarded. While conduct subsequent to the preparation and execution of the will may be taken into account, such conduct must have a direct bearing on whether the testator knew and approved of the contents of the will.

> (c)     Where suspicions circumstances exist, the propounder of the will must prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the testator knew and approved of the contents of the will by adducing affirmative evidence of the testator’s knowledge and approval. The court will typically look for evidence that the testamentary instrument was read over by, or to, the testator, or evidence that the testator gave instructions for the drafting of the will which was drafted in accordance with those instructions.

> (d)     The central task of a solicitor is to ensure that the terms of the will reflect the testator’s wishes. The solicitor should be cautious about taking instructions from any person who is to be named as a beneficiary in the will. If a testator is known to be suffering from any mental infirmity, a doctor should be called to certify her mental capacity before she is allowed to sign the will to ensure that such a testator fully understands the will.

80     In the case of **_Muriel Chee_**, the Court of Appeal agreed with the trial judge that the presumption of knowledge and approval did not arise because of the existence of suspicious circumstances. The evidence was that it was the appellant sister and not the testator who had instructed the lawyer, MO, who was a family relative, on the terms of the 1996 Will. The evidence did not show that T understood and approved of the contents of the will. There was no evidence that the will had been explained to T who had merely signed what had been placed before her. The CA summarised the legal principles thus:

> “\[46\]  **Once testamentary capacity has been established, a rebuttable presumption arises that the testator knew and approved of the contents of the will at the time of execution. While the legal burden of proof lies at all times with the propounder of the will, the evidential burden of proof shifts in ordinary circumstances to the opponent of the will to rebut this presumption. However, it is necessary to note that under established law, the presumption does not arise where there were circumstances surrounding the execution of the will which would raise a well-grounded suspicion that the will (or some provision in it) did not express the mind of the testator**…..

> \[60\]  In our view, this case demonstrates that solicitors who undertake the task of preparing wills and/or witnessing the execution of wills must take the necessary precautions or steps in order to fulfil their duties to their clients… **The central task is to ensure that the terms of the will reflect the wishes of the testator. How this is done depends on the circumstances of each case**. In every case, the solicitor should be cautious about taking instructions from any person who is to be named as a beneficiary in the will. If a testator is known to be suffering from any mental infirmity, a doctor should be called to certify her mental capacity before she is allowed to sign the will to ensure that such a testator fully understands the will…. Furthermore, the solicitor should ask the appropriate questions to ascertain the testator’s capacity to understand the contents of the will…. Finally, as a matter of good professional practice, if not professional prudence, the solicitor should make a contemporary written record of his or her attendances on the testator so that he or she would be able to recall exactly what had transpired during the meeting or meetings.”

> \[Emphasis added.\]

81     In the case of **_Lian Kok Hong v Lian Bee Leng and another_** <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGCA 24</span>, the court had to decide whether to uphold a 2010 Will or an August 2012 Will which was based on the testator’s (T’s) own handwritten draft, with some amendments. During the period when the August 2012 Will was made, T had been plagued with various medical ailments and was hospitalised in late July and early September 2012. The CA overturned the decision of the High Court judge and upheld the 2012 Will. Even though T had testamentary capacity, the presumption that T knew and approved of the 2012 Will did not operate because of the presence of suspicious circumstances related to the preparation and execution of the will. However, the evidence showed that T knew and approved of the 2012 Will. He had _inter alia_ scrutinised the 2012 Will intensely, and read and signed it after signing against the amendments. On the types of suspicious circumstances that would be applicable, the CA held that only circumstances that attend or relate to the preparation and execution of the will were relevant.

> “\[65\] …. Muriel Chee should thus be understood in the light of its facts. It should not be read as authority that all suspicious circumstances, whether or not they relate to the execution and preparation of the will, may be taken into account in determining if the usual presumption that a testator who has testamentary capacity knew and approved the contents of the will operates. **Circumstances are relevant only if they attend or relate to the preparation and execution of the will**. **Otherwise, all kinds of non-related circumstances may be used to rebut the presumption.** We therefore held that the judge erred in stating that suspicious circumstances no longer needed to relate to the preparation and execution of the contested will.

> \[Emphasis added.\]

82     Another instructive case is **_ULV_**. In that case, the testatrix, T, passed away in 2016, leaving behind two wills. Her main asset was her flat. The first will, the 2004 Will, favoured her favourite respondent-son. The second will, the 2008 Will, contained 2 contradictory clauses, suffice to say, T’s flat would be inherited by the appellant-son whom she deeply resented, and who had lived with her. The appellant-son was present when the 2008 Will was executed. The District Judge below upheld the 2004 Will and held the 2008 Will to be invalid. The decision was affirmed on appeal. Even though there was sufficient evidence of testamentary incapacity to execute the 2008 Will, Justice Tan Puay Boon held that T could not have known and approved of its contents. The judge accepted that the appellant’s mere presence at the time the 2008 Will was prepared and signed was not sufficient to constitute a suspicious circumstance. However, the judge went on to find that the presumption was rebutted by the evidence. The provisions of the unusual 2008 Will were on their face contradictory and had not been explained to T in sufficient detail and clarity. T did not fully grasp that the appellant-son, whom she deeply resented, would inherit the flat under the 2008 Will. The judge helpfully summarised the relevant principles as follows:

> “\[36\] The testator must know and approve the contents of the will….. The test for approval and knowledge, as stated in Theobald on Wills at para 3-017 … is whether the testator understood (a) what was in the will when he signed it; and (b) what its effect would be. **This requirement is also sometimes described by saying that the will must reflect the true intentions of the testator**… However, the testator need not comprehend the full effect of the words used in the will, and the will may be valid even if he was mistaken as to the legal effect of the provisions…

> \[**37**\]   **Once testamentary capacity is established, a rebuttal presumption arises that the testator knew and approved the contents of the will and the evidential burden shifts to the opponent of the will to rebut this presumption. This presumption, however, will not operate where there were circumstances attending or relating to the preparation and execution of the will which would raise a well-grounded suspicion that the will did not express the mind of the testator** (Muriel Chee at \[46\]; Lian Kok Hong v Lian Bee Leng <span class="citation">\[2016\] 3 SLR 405</span> (“_Lian Kok Hong_”) at \[65\]). In that regard, the applicable principles are as follows:

>> (a)     **Any circumstances which have nothing to do with the preparation and execution of the will are to be disregarded** (_Lian Kok Hong_ at \[58\] and \[59\]). **While conduct subsequent to the preparation and execution of the will may be taken into account, such conduct “Must have a direct bearing on whether the testator knew and approved of the contents of the will**” (_Lian Kok Hong_ at \[60\] and \[63\]). I understand this to mean that subsequent conduct is only relevant in so far as it constitutes evidence of the contemporaneous circumstances relating to the preparation and execution of the will.

>> (b)    There is no magic formula (comprising a certain fixed number of factors or criteria) to ascertain whether the circumstances surrounding a will are suspicious. The degree of suspicion will vary with the circumstances of the case (Muriel Chee at \[47\]).

>> (c)    An example of a suspicious circumstance is where a will was prepared by a person who takes a substantial benefit under it, or who procured its execution, such as by suggesting the terms to the testator or instructing a solicitor to draft the will which is then executed by the testator alone (Muriel Chee at \[48\]).

>> (d)     **Where suspicions circumstances exist, the propounder of the will must prove on a balance of probabilities that the testator knew and approved of the contents of the will by adducing affirmative evidence of the testator’s knowledge and approval**. The greater the degree of suspicion, the stronger the affirmative proof of the testator’s knowledge and approval must be to dispel the suspicion… **The court will typically look for evidence that the testamentary instrument was read over by, or to, the testator, or evidence that the testator gave instructions for the drafting of the will and that the will was drafted in accordance with those instructions… Under ordinary circumstances, the reading of a will to a testator not suffering from any mental infirmity would be sufficient evidence of his understanding or knowledge of the contents**.. Proving that the terms of the will were read to or explained to the testator is “the best way to show that the testator understood the terms of the will (assuming he had testamentary capacity and his mind was not unduly influenced by some part or event)” (_Lian Kok Hong_ at \[72\]), though it is not the only way..”

> \[Emphasis added.\]

### (b)   Whether suspicious circumstances exist to prevent operation of presumption?

83     It is the Disputants’ case that the presumption should not operate because the circumstances surrounding and/or concerning the execution of the 2016 Will raise a real suspicion that it does not express the mind of the Testatrix. I am unable to agree.

84     First, the Disputants argue that the 2016 Will was not rational. For reasons set out above, I am of the view that it was rational, especially in light of the family dispute that had taken place in early 2016 and the good relationship between the Testatrix and the Plaintiffs.

85     Second, the Disputants argue that it was suspicious that the 1st Plaintiff only made an appointment with the lawyer six days _after_ the Testatrix’s discharge from hospital on 21 December 2016. Mr John Tay argues that the Plaintiffs had planned the “delay” to give themselves time to manipulate and coach the Testatrix on the contents of the 2016 Will.[^27] I am unable to agree. The Testatrix was discharged on Wednesday, 21 December 2016, and the appointment with the lawyer was made soon after the Christmas weekend on Tuesday, 27 December 2016. I find nothing suspicious about this, given that the 1st Plaintiff would probably need some time to find an available lawyer due to the Christmas holidays.

86     Third, the Disputants argue that it was highly suspicious that after the Testatrix was discharged from hospital, the Plaintiffs would visit the Testatrix every morning and take her out, and drop her home only in the evening when she was very tired. Mr John Tay argues that they spent their time trying to “convince” and/or otherwise “mentally break-down” any resistance the \[Testatrix\] may have had to their “immoral scheme”, for her to bequeath her assets to the Plaintiffs. They only brought her to the lawyer’s office after they had successfully “coached” her.[^28]

87     It is not disputed that the Plaintiffs and the 7th Defendant did spend a lot of time with the Testatrix after she was discharged from hospital on 21 December 2016. The 1st Plaintiff would visit in her in the evenings after her discharge, and when the 7th Defendant arrived in Singapore on 24 December 2016, the Plaintiffs and 7th Defendant started to spend the whole day with her. However, I find nothing suspicious or sinister about siblings wanting to spend time with a close sibling who has fallen very ill, and find the allegations against the Plaintiffs to be unjustified. In particular, there was no reason for her closest sibling, the 7th Defendant, to be part of this “immoral scheme” since she did not benefit from the 2016 Will.

88     Fourth, the Disputants also argue that it was suspicious that the Plaintiffs had deliberately kept Mhd Y away from the Testatrix, and kept him in the dark about the 2016 Will. The rely on Mhd Y’s Allegations, namely, that when the Testatrix was first admitted to hospital on 12 December 2016, Mhd Y was the only person who took care of her, but after she was discharged and the 1st Plaintiff found out about the illness, the 1st Plaintiff took over control of the Testatrix who was very ill.

89     As explained earlier, Mhd Y did not give evidence at trial and I had ruled that his SD was inadmissible. Even then, I should point out that it is not accurate to say that the 1st Plaintiff was not aware of the Testatrix’s first admission and that Mhd Y was the only person who looked after her during that time. The evidence actually shows that Testatrix had texted the 1st Plaintiff to inform him about her first admission into TTSH on 12 December 2016, and during that time, the 1st Plaintiff would visit the Testatrix to help care for her and buy her food.[^29] Whilst there is no direct evidence on the nature and quality of the relationship between Mhd Y and the Testatrix, the Disputants themselves have variously testified that the family did not approve of Mhd Y and the Testatrix had problems with him.[^30] Suffice to say, if Mhd Y was staying with the Testatrix, she could easily have informed him about the 2016 Will if she had wanted to.

90     Fifth, the Disputants argue that it was suspicious that the Plaintiffs did not inform Mother and the other siblings of the Testatrix’s illness. I am unable to agree. I accept that she may not have wanted to inform Mother of her illness given that Mother herself was unwell. Further, based on the family dispute in early 2016 and the family estrangements that ensued, I find nothing suspicious about the Testatrix not wanting to inform her other siblings about her illness. They were not even on speaking terms.

91     Sixth, the Disputants argue that the 1st Plaintiff had orchestrated the making of the 2016 Will when the Testatrix was in a weak physical and mental state. They argue that it was suspicious that the 1st Plaintiff had arranged the appointment with the lawyer, brought the Testatrix to the lawyer’s office and was present when she gave instructions to the lawyer. Further, when the lawyer was drafting the will, the Plaintiffs were still in close proximity in the sofa area which was about 6 feet away from Mr N’s office-cubicle and within hearing distance. This would have psychologically affected the Testatrix’s ability to make an important decision regarding her will.

92     Given the relationship between the Testatrix and the 1st Plaintiff at this point of time, and the medical condition of the Testatrix, I actually find it reasonable, not suspicious, that she had asked him to help her arrange an appointment with a lawyer, and that the Plaintiffs and 7th Defendant had accompanied her to the lawyer’s office. As for the lawyer’s meeting itself, I accept Mr N’s evidence that his perception of the Testatrix was that she was clear on her instructions and did not show any signs that she was afraid or hesitant in telling him what her instructions were[^31]:

> “Q:    The proximity of the presence to the testatrix would psychologically affect her ability to read – to make the important decision or influence her decision.. do you agree?

> A:    It is a possibility but in this case I did not see any signs that she was afraid of telling what her instructions are. Or \[that\] she was hesitant in telling me what her instructions were.”

93     Seventh, the Disputants also raise matters that happened _after_ the execution of the 2016 Will, in support of their case. These matters were based principally on Mhd Y’s Allegations: (a) When the Testatrix was admitted to hospital the second time on 17 January 2017, the Plaintiffs chased him away and instructed hospital staff not to allow him to visit the Testatrix. (b) The 1st Plaintiff warned Mhd Y not to tell Mother and anyone in the family when the Testatrix passed away. (c) After her death, the 1st Plaintiff forced him to hand over the Testatrix’s personal belongings to him, asked him to leave the Serangoon Flat and emptied the Testatrix’s bank account with her ATM card.

94     I find these allegations to be hearsay and without any evidential basis. Further and in any event, these are all matters that do not relate to the preparation and execution of the 2016 Will. In particular, what has happened to the Testatrix’s personal belongings, jewellery and ATM card are matters that relate to the proper administration of the 2016 Will.

95     For the above reasons, I am not persuaded that there were suspicious circumstances attending or relating to the preparation and execution of the 2016 Will which would raise a well-grounded suspicion that it did not express the mind of the Testatrix.

### (c)   Affirmative evidence that Testatrix did not know or approve of the 2016 Will?

96     Further, I am not satisfied that the Disputants have adduced any affirmative evidence to rebut the presumption that the Testatrix knew and approved of the 2016 Will.

97     Instead of adducing affirmative evidence, the Disputants argue that Mr N had done an extremely unprofessional and shoddy job and failed to read and/or properly translate the 2016 Will, which was in English, to the Testatrix who had given him instructions in Malay.[^32]

98     My findings on this issue are as follows:

> (a)     It seems likely that the Testatrix and Mr N communicated mostly in Malay. Under cross-examination, the Plaintiffs and the 7th Defendant testified that to the best of their recollection, the Testatrix and Mr N communicated in Malay. Mr N himself testified that he usually communicated with Malay clients in the Malay language which they were most comfortable in, even if they understood and spoke English. As he grew up in a neighbourhood which spoke Malay, he was quite proficient in Malay and could read but not write the Malay language.[^33] In this case, he cannot recall clearly, but he would most likely have spoken to the Testatrix in a mix of Malay and English.

> (b)     Importantly, just because the Testatrix was comfortable speaking to Mr N in Malay does not mean she could not read or understand English. In fact, the evidence shows conclusively that the Testatrix was effectively bilingual, and read and understood both Malay and English. She had completed her PSLE; could read and understand English according to her siblings including the Disputants; used English in her job as restaurant supervisor; and sent text messages to the 1st Plaintiff mainly in English, interspersed with some Malay words and expressions. [^34]

> (c)     The 2016 Will was not translated to the Testatrix in Malay. There was no need for a translation given that the Testatrix was effectively bilingual. Further, the 2016 Will was a simple and straightforward will.

> (d)     I accept Mr N’s evidence that he would have gone through the contents of the 2016 Will with the Testatrix to confirm that she understood the contents. He would not have engrossed the 2016 Will and witnessed her signature if she had not expressed that she understood the contents of the 2016 Will[^35]:

>> “Q:    .. So, how do you know she... understood the content?

>> A:    I supposed she understood it. I would have asked her and she would have said she understood it.

>> Q:    How did you ask her? With Malay or English?

>> A:    I cannot recollect whether I spoke in English or Malay to her but as I can see from the will that was signed, there is no interpretation clause. So, I believe that the testator understood English…. Very often when I speak to clients who are Malay, even though they understand English .. I speak to them in Malay because they are more comfortable

>> …

>> Q:    .. So you present this to the testatrix… and according to you she .. understood the content?

>> A:    Yes.

>> …

>> Q:    You are sure she understood or you think she may have understood? It’s a different thing.

>> A:     **I would not have witnessed her signature on the will unless she understood it**.”

>> \[Emphasis added.\]

99     The Disputants also argue in submissions that an adverse inference should be drawn against the Plaintiffs for their failure to call the second witness, Mr R, to give evidence at trial. They argue that Mr R would have been a truly independent witness since he did not prepare the will, and he would have been able to shed light on how the will was drafted and executed. The short answer to that is that it was open to the Disputants to call Mr R as a witness if they had believed he was a material witness who could give affirmative evidence on their behalf. They did not do so.

### (d)   Conclusions on knowledge and approval of the 2016 Will

100    I find that the presumption that the Testatrix knew and approved of the 2016 Will operates. Further, the Disputants have not furnished evidence that the Testatrix did not know and approve of the will. On the contrary, the evidence points to the Testatrix’s knowledge and approval of the 2016 Will.

## Issue 3 – The Free Will of the Testatrix: Whether there had been undue influence?

101    Finally, I am not persuaded that the 2016 Will was executed under undue influence. The burden of proving that a will was executed under undue influence is on the party who alleges it. The test is a high one and a case of undue influence is only made out where there is evidence of coercion and pressure that has overpowered the freedom of action of the testator without having convinced the will of the testator. Evidence of persuasion alone would not suffice and undue influence cannot be presumed.

102    In **_ULV_**, Justice Tan explained the requirements for proving undue influence in the probate context as follows:

> “\[68\]  **Undue influence in the probate context “means coercion, ie the testator is coerced into making a will (or part of a will) which he does not want to make**” (_Theobald on Wills_ at para 3-032). There are various ways of expressing the substance of this test. It has been said, for example, that it must be shown that the testator was not merely persuaded but was pressured into losing his freedom of choice (_Halsbury’s_ at para 190.199); that there was pressure which overpowered the testator’s volition without convincing his judgment (_Parry and Kerridge_ at para 5-16, citing _Hall v Hall_ (1868) LR 1 P&D 481 at 482); and that the will of the testator is coerced into doing that which he or she does not desire to do (_Rajaratnam Kumar v Estate of Rajaratnam Saravana Muthu (deceased)_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 4 SLR 93</span> (“Rajaratnam”) at \[67\].

> \[71\]  … It is therefore recognised that t**he test for undue influence in the testamentary context is that of coercion alone. The case and academic authorities strongly indicate that undue influence in this sense cannot be presumed**…

> \[73\]  …. **the test for undue influence is a high one and requires coercion overpowering the testator’s volition**….”

\[Emphasis added.\]

103    The Disputants argue that the Plaintiffs had taken advantage of the Testatrix who will very ill and in a weak and vulnerable state. They argue that the Plaintiffs had coerced her into making the 2016 Will by coaching her, pressurizing her, and isolating her. The Disputants essentially rely on the same arguments raised to argue that suspicious circumstances exist to vitiate the presumption that the Testatrix knew and approved of the 2016 Will. However, for the reasons I have already elucidated above, I do not find the matters/circumstances raised to be suspicious. In any case, suspicions and beliefs are not sufficient to establish undue influence. The Disputants need to show clear evidence, which they have not done. I will not repeat my findings in paragraphs 86 to 97 above, save to reiterate the following points.

104    First, there is no evidence at all that the Plaintiffs and the 7th Defendant had coached the Testatrix on the contents of the 2016 Will. There is also no reason for the 7th Defendant to be part of this allegedly “immoral scheme” as the 2016 Will was disadvantageous to her.

105    Second, there is no evidence that the Plaintiffs had orchestrated and pressurized the Testatrix into making the 2016 Will. Their mere presence with her at the lawyer’s office does not constitute undue influence. Mr N gave clear and consistent evidence that the Testatrix was very clear on her instructions, and did not show any signs of fear or hesitation in giving instructions.

106    Third, there is no evidence that the Plaintiffs had isolated the Testatrix from her family and friends during the period of her illness until she passed away. In fact, the evidence actually shows that the Testatrix led an independent life. For example, on 25 December 2016, the Testatrix informed the 1st Plaintiff that she was “strolling downstairs” and on 26 December 2016, she said that she would make her own way to the coffee-shop downstairs.[^36] On at least one occasion on 29 December 2016, her neighbours visited her for more than 3 hours from morning to afternoon, without the Plaintiffs’ present.[^37] The Testatrix therefore had the free will, independence, ability and capacity to text, meet and talk to friends and family, if she had wanted to.

107    The Disputants have not met the high bar of proving, on a balance of probabilities, that the Plaintiffs had unduly influenced the Testatrix into making the 2016 Will.

## Conclusion

108    The Disputants were upset with the Plaintiffs primarily for two reasons. First and foremost, for keeping the news of the Testatrix’s illness and death a secret from Mother and the other siblings; they were therefore unable to visit and talk to their late sister when she was ill, and were not able to attend her funeral and pay their last respects when she passed away. Second, they were also upset over the contents of the 2016 Will which, to their minds, unjustly enriched the Plaintiffs, at the expense of Mother.

109    Underpinning these grievances was a lack of communication and sibling estrangements since at least around January/February 2016, with roots that probably go much deeper. To fill the void of information, the Disputants reached out to Mhd Y in their search for answers, which led them to arrive at certain conclusions regarding the 2016 Will. However, I find that their conclusions were based not so much on evidence, but on hearsay, opinion, imagination, as well as their own sense of morality and justice over how the estate of the Testatrix should be distributed, to perhaps balance their unwritten “messy family” ledger. Based on the evidence adduced at trial, I am satisfied that when she instructed Mr N on her will, the Testatrix knew exactly what she was doing, and executed the will of her own volition.

110    Whilst it is unfortunate that the siblings had their “reunion” in court over their late sister’s will, it is my hope that the family can find closure over the passing of their late sister, try to understand each other a bit better, forgive if possible, and move on peacefully from here. When family differences arise, keeping silent, building walls and talking through lawyers may not be the best ways to communicate, and may result in greater misunderstanding and unhappiness.

111    For reasons set out in this judgment, I uphold the 2016 Will and grant an order in terms of prayers (i) to (iii) of the Plaintiffs’ Statement of Claim. The Counterclaims filed by the Disputants are dismissed.

112    I will hear parties on costs.

This was in reply to a written query from Plaintiff’s counsel on 16 August 2018 asking which language the Testatrix used to communicate with him. However, the 2016 Will does not contain a translation clause and under cross-examination, Mr N clarified, and I accept, that the reference to the will have being translated in the letter dated 21 August 2018 was a mistake.
