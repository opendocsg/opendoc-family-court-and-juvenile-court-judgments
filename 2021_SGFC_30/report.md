Divorce – unreasonable behaviour – irretrievable breakdown

29 March 2021

### District Judge Wendy Yu:

## Background Facts

1       The parties were married in 1993 and they have 3 children, namely, \[Child 1\] who was born on xx May 1995[^1], and \[Child 2\] who was born on xx February 1998[^2] and \[Child 3\] who was born on xx October 2001[^3]. The Wife (hereinafter referred to as “the Plaintiff”) is employed as the General Manager at a company, while the Husband (hereinafter referred to as “the Defendant”) is a General Manager in a managing body of a strata-titled property[^4].

2       On 18 July 2019, the Plaintiff commenced divorce proceedings based on the fact that the marriage had broken down irretrievably in that the Defendant had behaved in such a way that she could not reasonably be expected to live with him. The Defendant then filed a Defence on 13 August 2019 to contest the Plaintiff’s case as he did not agree to the dissolution of the marriage.

3       The contested divorce hearing took place over 5 trial days in two tranches, from 30 June 2020 to 2 July 2020 and from 14 October 2020 to 15 October 2020. On 15 December 2020, I delivered my decision and granted the interim judgment on the Plaintiff’s claim.

4       The Defendant, being dissatisfied with my decision, filed a Notice of Appeal on 28 December 2020. I shall now furnish the reasons for my decision.

## The Alleged Unreasonable Behaviour

5       The Defendant’s alleged unreasonable behaviour was particularized as follows[^5]: -

> (i)      **The Defendant has not and does not contribute financially to the marriage**;

>> (a)       Throughout the marriage, the Plaintiff has been the party responsible for the children’s education as well as almost all of the household expenditure.[^6]

>> (b)       Despite frequently claiming that he does not have money to contribute to the children’s or household expenses, the Defendant had the financial means to purchase both a motorcycle and a car. The car was purchased by the Defendant as recently in 2019. The Defendant has neglected to contribute to either the household expenditure or the children’s education costs.

>> (c)       Since purchasing the 2nd matrimonial home, the Plaintiff and the Defendant had agreed to equally contribute to the mortgage but the Defendant logged into the Plaintiff’s Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) account using the Plaintiff’s Singpass in 2014 and altered the Plaintiff’s mortgage loan contribution to 100% instead of the previously agreed upon contribution of 50%.[^7]

>> (d)       The Defendant had on one occasion stolen a cash cheque meant for \[Child 3\]’s Mathematics tutor.[^8]

>> (e)       The Plaintiff had extended loans to the Defendant in the course of the marriage to help him pay off various debts and loans owed to the respective financial institutions[^9] and the Plaintiff is claiming from the Defendant all loans and monies owed by the Defendant to the Plaintiff which has not been repaid.[^10]

> (ii)      **Defendant’s History of Physical Abuse towards the Plaintiff;**

>> (a)       In 1996, the Plaintiff, the Defendant and \[Child 1\] had been visiting the Defendant’s family in Penang when the first instance of violence to the Plaintiff was committed by the Defendant.[^11]

>> (b)       The second occasion of physical abuse against the Plaintiff occurred in 1999.[^12] The Defendant has also “physically and psychologically abused both the Plaintiff and/or the children.”[^13]

>> (c)       When \[Child 1\] was about one year old the Defendant placed \[Child 1\]’s hands against a hot, boiling pot as punishment for his misbehaving and crying.[^14]

>> (d)       On Mother’s Day, in 2008, the Defendant struck \[Child 1\], then twelve years old with such force that \[Child 1\]’s bracelet dislodged from his wrist and flew across the room.[^15]

> (iii)      **The Defendant’s History of Psychological Abuse**

>> (a)       In or around 1995, the Defendant arrived at the Plaintiff’s parents’ home in a drunken state and defecated in the garden.[^16]

>> (b)       During a vacation in Koh Samui with the Plaintiff in 2011, the Defendant confessed that he had an inappropriate encounter with his niece.[^17] This inappropriate encounter occurred in 2008 whilst the Defendant was working in Kuala Lumpur. As far as the Plaintiff is aware, the Defendant’s niece was then approximately 18 years old.[^18] The Defendant told the Plaintiff that his niece and him had gone into his room where they begin massaging each other.[^19]

## The Plaintiff’s Position

6       The Plaintiff had 4 witnesses to support her case. Besides the Plaintiff giving evidence to support her case, Madam \[A\] (who is the Plaintiff’s friend of 35 years[^20]), the Plaintiff’s children, \[Child 1\] and \[Child 2\], had also testified to support the Plaintiff’s case.

7       The Plaintiff has made two main points in her case. First, by reason of the Defendant’s “ongoing and continuous unreasonable behaviour throughout the marriage”[^21], she has found it intolerable to continue living with him. Second, “the defence of a harmonious marriage relied on by (the Defendant) lacks credibility on all fronts”.[^22]

8       During cross-examination, Madam \[A\] gave evidence that the Plaintiff had shared with her that the couple had "many fights”[^23] and that she could see that the Plaintiff was “very unhappy” in the “last few years”.[^24] Madam \[A\] had also testified that the Plaintiff has told her that the car scratching incident in 2019 “is not the reason for the divorce”[^25] and that the Plaintiff told her that “she really cannot take it anymore”. The Plaintiff also told her that she has been “hanging in there for many, many years.”[^26]

9       During the cross-examination of \[Child 1\], he gave evidence that the Plaintiff shared with him that she had filed the divorce because of “the lack of trust”[^27] which came from “the culmination of every single incident that happened over and over again.”[^28]

10     During the cross-examination of \[Child 2\], when she was being asked about the car-scratching incident in 2019, testified of the incident as “major”[^29] as “it has taken a lot for (the Plaintiff) to trust (the Defendant) again” and “that it really broke her trust” and she knew that the “impact will be huge”.[^30] When asked further why this incident would have such an impact on the family, \[Child 2\] explained that even though “things had gotten better” and that the family “had all been trying to work to move forward”, but “because there was still underlying tensions”[^31], she knew that “the underlying tensions added with this would cause further damage”.[^32] When being asked by the Defendant’s counsel as to what she said to the Defendant when she heard that the Defendant was actually going to give her the car for a gift, \[Child 2\] expressed that she was “a bit speechless in the beginning because (she) almost didn’t believe that that would happen as it just wasn’t very normal for that to have happened”[^33], and that she felt it was “a bit unnecessary and so (she) was a bit shocked and a bit in disbelief when (the Defendant) said that the car was intended to be a birthday present.”[^34]

11     I had assessed the demeanour of the Plaintiff’s witnesses and found them to be credible witnesses. While the Defendant had submitted that the Court should disregard \[Child 2\]’s testimony because of the long pauses[^35] before she spoke, I found her to be a credible witness and the pauses were more likely because of the pressure she was under, having to testify at a trial for one parent’s case against another, rather than because of an issue of lack of credibility. It is never easy for a child to testify in a trial to support an application to end her own parent’s marriage.

12     The Plaintiff gave evidence of examples of her paying off the Defendant’s debts, which started in 2004[^36] when the Defendant came to the Plaintiff and told her that he needed help with some credit card debts. The Plaintiff testified that the Defendant had debts of about $35,000 which she had to help him clear[^37] in 2007. According to the Plaintiff, there were further loans which she gave to the Defendant in 2011, 2012 and 2013[^38]. The Plaintiff further testified that the Defendant was always getting into financial trouble[^39] with a “repeated pattern” where the Defendant “racks up credit card debts” and “keeps quiet until the banks are chasing him” and “will come to the Plaintiff and ask (the Plaintiff) to help him” when legal action may be commenced against him.[^40] The Plaintiff felt that she had to bail the Defendant out repeatedly because she had young children and she did it to keep the family together.[^41]

13     The Plaintiff had exhibited[^42] an agreement dated 23 November 2014, drafted by \[Child 1\] in order to mediate the dispute between the Plaintiff and Defendant, which included clauses such as “_I will remain honest and transparent at all times and will not incur any debt (credit card, credit lines, or loans of any sort) without discussing it first with my spouse_” and “_I will not put my spouse in a position of being surprised by my deed or actions”._

14     The Plaintiff expressed her frustration that the problem in their marriage was that despite the Defendant saying he is earning less, he constantly ended up in situations where banks and credit card companies were chasing him, because he knew that the Plaintiff earned more and he knew that she will bail him out.[^43]

15     The Plaintiff then testified of the incident in 2008[^44] with the Defendant’s niece, \[B\], which, to her, is “not merely a sexual indiscretion” on the Defendant’s part, but with “someone who represents (his) daughter”[^45]. To the Plaintiff, it demonstrated a “pattern” where, if the Defendant is presented with an opportunity to do something where he can get away with, “he would take it.”[^46]. She added that the Defendant “always does these reckless things that he doesn’t see through what the consequences will be.”[^47]

16     When cross-examined about the car scratching incident in 2019, the Plaintiff explained that it was “the straw that broke the camel’s back, it was cumulative…because it was the final straw”[^48] where, according to the Plaintiff, the children have told her that “enough is enough” and that the car incident “is not something that should be taken in isolation”[^49]. The Plaintiff further clarified that the incident became a “nail on the coffin”[^50] after “the cumulative effect of all the betrayals of trust” and the “issues that (the Plaintiff) had to endure due to his reckless behaviour”.[^51] The car scratching incident occurred with the background where the Defendant had told the Plaintiff a few weeks before the incident that he could not afford to pay her back her loans because he had no money, and yet had proceeded to purchase a car by taking up another $36,000 loan out of spite after “he did something in pure defiance” in scratching her car.[^52]

17     The Plaintiff had considered that if she had condoned his conduct after this incident, she concluded that this would be what her life would be until the day she dies[^53] and she no longer wanted to be a “sitting duck”[^54]anymore.

## The Defendant’s Position

18     The Defendant disagreed that the marriage had broken down irretrievably or that he had behaved in such a way that the Plaintiff could not reasonably be expected to live with him. The Defendant expressed that he did not want a divorce[^55] and wanted to keep his family together.

19     The Defendant had, in his closing submissions, expressed that he felt insecure and emasculated as the Plaintiff earned more than him and that his finances were under the scrutiny of the Plaintiff.[^56]

20     The Defendant acknowledged that during the period between 2005 to 2015, he had “put tremendous pressure” on the Plaintiff because of his own mental health issues[^57] and depression. However, the Defendant had asserted that for the last 5 years they never had any fights about money[^58].

21     On the financial front, the Defendant had, during cross examination, explained that he felt it was “unfair” that even though they agreed to share expenses on a “50,50 basis”, he was earning “a lot less” than the Plaintiff but was “still expending all the expenses on the 50, 50 basis”[^59] . This meant that the Defendant’s left behind money was very little as compared to the Plaintiff’s, which meant that the lifestyle that the Plaintiff could lead was very different from that of the Defendant, which the Defendant felt was unfair to him.[^60]

22     The Defendant admitted that some of his debts were paid by the Plaintiff, but also added that he had paid some of his own debts, and that he has “covered (their) financial obligations in different ways”.[^61] The Defendant has also acknowledged that there was “an outstanding amount” of “money that (they) didn’t address, (they) didn’t resolve.”[^62] When questioned by the Plaintiff’s counsel as to why he did not pay the Plaintiff the outstanding amount owing to her, he answered that they “never talked about it” because they had a “dispute over whether it’s $30,000 or $70,000” so if they brought up the topic again, he was of the view that it would “end up in another big fight”. [^63]

23     When being asked about the email written by the Plaintiff to the Defendant dated 15 August 2014[^64], where the Plaintiff pleaded the Defendant to “stop this madness” with regard to the Defendant’s management of his finances, the Defendant acknowledged that he did not reply to the email[^65]. The Defendant admitted that he had encashed the cheque intended for \[Child 3\]’s tutor in June 2014[^66] and admitted to using the Plaintiff’s Singpass in October 2014 without her knowledge to change her CPF contributions to the matrimonial home[^67] as his CPF funds were depleting. However, he had explained that the Plaintiff had given her access[^68] to make changes to the CPF account. The Defendant also expressed his frustration about how the Plaintiff had stolen from his account by taking his ATM card and withdrawing money and he was “a bit angry with her” for this.[^69]

24     The Defendant conceded[^70] that he had breached the agreement dated 23rd November 2014[^71] that \[Child 1\] drafted in order to mediate between parties as he was “not transparent”[^72].

25     When the Plaintiff’s counsel put forth the statement during cross-examination that the Defendant was “happy to let (the Plaintiff) continue to bear the financial burden of the family”[^73], he did not deny this and explained that this was because he did not want any confrontation. The Defendant also acknowledged that he had breached the promise not to incur any debt without first discussing it with the Plaintiff[^74], that he had breached the agreement not to put the Plaintiff in a position of being surprised[^75] and that he also breached the agreement not to lie and cheat[^76]. However, at re-examination, when being asked by his own lawyer as to whether he agreed to be bound by the paragraph, the Defendant said it was a request made by his son and wife and so he signed it “because they asked me to sign it and I signed it”.[^77]

26     The Defendant knew that the Plaintiff had thought of filing for divorce and knew that she had already consulted her lawyers in 2014[^78]. However, his position was that if she wanted to divorce him after consulting lawyers in 2014, she could have done so back then[^79]. The Defendant believed that his marriage was on “solid grounds”[^80] after that and that it did not merit the Plaintiff using “unreasonable behaviour” for divorce as he had been on his best behaviour for the past 5 years.[^81] It is the Defendant’s case that he had purchased the car in 2019 for his daughter[^82] and buying a car for his daughter should not amount to unreasonable behaviour. The Defendant further added that the Plaintiff had initiated sex with him in 2018[^83] during their trip to Taj Mahal, which furthered his belief that the Plaintiff had already forgiven him.

27     The Defendant did not deny some of the allegations made by the Plaintiff. Specifically, he admitted that he still owed her money although the amount that she is claiming is wrong.[^84] During cross examination, when questioned by the Plaintiff’s counsel as to whether he recalled that there was a conversation where the Plaintiff had told him that she was pressed for money and needed his help and where the Defendant had answered the Plaintiff that he had no money, the Defendant stated that he did not remember when such a conversation took place although he did not deny that there was such a conversation. The Defendant also did not remember the details of such a conversation.[^85]

28     The Defendant also did not deny the encounter in 2008 with his niece, \[B\], who was 20 years old[^86] then, where the massage started off “as a regular massage” but he “got carried away” and he “touched her in her private parts”[^87]. The Defendant explained that his niece took off her clothes and when she decided to take off her underpants, he “lost (his) ability to think”[^88]. The Defendant agreed that the decision to give the massage was made when the Defendant and \[B\] were having dinner before that[^89]. The Defendant also did not deny that he had hid this encounter from the Plaintiff for 3 years[^90] before disclosing it to her.

29     The Defendant clarified that he first gave \[B\] a scrub[^91], that \[B\] had taken her top off[^92] but he had remained fully clothed[^93]. \[B\] then went for a shower and then the Defendant gave her a massage[^94]. However, the Defendant subsequently further clarified that he had given her a back massage, followed by a scrub, then \[B\] went for a shower, and he gave her a further massage.[^95] It was during the second massage when she was naked that the Defendant had touched her in the pubic area.[^96] According to the Defendant, both of them then went to bed[^97].

30     The Defendant explained that he was of the view that the Plaintiff’s trust issues “is more related to finance and not so much about being unfaithful to her”.[^98] The Defendant had also added that he was suffering from depression since 2005.[^99] He believed that the Plaintiff had already forgiven him over the incident.[^100]

31     The Defendant had also informed the Court that since early 2019 he no longer had meals with the Plaintiff and has not been invited to any of the outings or anything that went on in the house, and that every day, as he came back home he went straight upstairs.[^101]

32     The Defendant had cited Section 95(3)(b), read with Section 95(6) of the Women’s Charter, that since parties lived together for a period of at least 6 months after the date of the occurrence of the final incident relied on by the Plaintiff, that incident has to be disregarded in determining the Defendant’s unreasonable behaviour. The Defendant used the cases of _VBZ v VBA_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 119</span> _and UZW v UZX_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGFC 91</span> to support his case on this issue.

## The Law

33     It is trite law that Section 95(1) of the Women’s Charter only provides one ground for divorce, and that is the irretrievable breakdown of the marriage. Section 95(3) then goes on to state that the “court hearing any proceedings for divorce shall not hold the marriage to have broken down irretrievably unless the plaintiff satisfies the court of one or more of the following facts:

> (a)     that the defendant has committed adultery and the plaintiff finds it intolerable to live with the defendant;

> (b)     that the defendant has behaved in such a way that the plaintiff cannot reasonably be expected to live with the defendant;

> (c)     that the defendant has deserted the plaintiff for a continuous period of at least 2 years immediately preceding the filing of the writ;

> (d)     that the parties to the marriage have lived apart for a continuous period of at least 3 years immediately preceding the filing of the writ and the defendant consents to a judgment being granted;

> (e)     that the parties to the marriage have lived apart for a continuous period of at least 4 years immediately preceding the filing of the writ.

34     In the present case, the Plaintiff’s case is that the Defendant has behaved in such a way that she cannot reasonably be expected to live with him, and she would have to prove her case on a balance of probabilities. The Defendant has not filed any counterclaim but only a defence, and avers that the marriage has not broken down irretrievably.

35     In _Wong Siew Boey v. Lee Boon Fatt_ <span class="citation">\[1994\] SGHC 35</span>, the Court had opined that the question whether the petitioner finds it intolerable to live with the respondent must be answered subjectively; and in dealing with behaviour, the question is whether the petitioner can reasonably be expected to live with the respondent and it is for the Court to answer this, using an objective test and having regard to the personalities of individuals before it, however far these may be removed from some theoretical norm. The Court must also assess the impact of the respondent’s conduct and the particular petitioner in the light of the whole history of the marriage and their relationship, and must look at behaviour by taking into account the _cumulative_ effect of behaviour, in relation to all the relevant circumstances.

36     The question whether the Defendant has behaved in such a way that it was unreasonable to expect the Plaintiff to live with him is essentially a finding of fact. The general test, as stated by KS Rajah JC (as he then was), was: “_Would any right-thinking person come to the conclusion that this husband has behaved in such a way that this wife cannot reasonably be expected to live with him, taking into account the whole of the circumstances and the characters and personalities of the parties?”_

37     The principles in _Wong Siew Boey_ have also been applied in _Castello Ana Paula Costa Fusillier v. Lobo Carlos Manuel Rosado_ \[2003\] 4 SLR (R) 331 and _Teo Hoon Ping v. Tan Lay Ying_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGHC 244</span>.

38     In the case of _TEF v TEG_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGFC 38</span>, the Court had also referred to the above decisions and stated that the test for determining whether a spouse had behaved in such a way that the other spouse has behaved in such a way that the other spouse cannot reasonably be expected to live with him/her is to be applied as follows:

> (a)     The question of whether the plaintiff finds it intolerable to live with the defendant must be answered subjectively, whether his/her attitude is reasonable is irrelevant;

> (b)     In dealing with the behaviour in question, the relevant question is whether the plaintiff can reasonably be expected to live with the defendant. It is the Court to answer this question, using an objective test, having regard to the personalities of the individuals in the light of the whole history of the marriage and their relationship, however far these may be removed from some theoretical norm.

> (c)     The Court must consider the cumulative effect of behaviour. Any conduct, active or passive, constitutes behaviour. The behaviour is not confined to behaviour towards the plaintiff: the behaviour may have relevance to the marriage although it is towards other members of the family or towards outsiders. Any and all behaviour may be taken into account, including omissions, where it has reference to the marriage.[^102]

## Applying the Law to the Facts of the Case

## Findings

## Did the Defendant behave as alleged by the Plaintiff?

39     I will look at the various facts that the Plaintiff has relied on to support her position that the Defendant had demonstrated unreasonable behaviour, in the following order:

> (a)     The Defendant had been physically abusive towards the Plaintiff.

> (b)     The Defendant’s history of physical abuse towards \[Child 1\].

> (c)     The Defendant’s history of psychological abuse, including a sexual encounter with his niece sometime in 2008.

> (d)     The Defendant does not and has not contributed financially to the marriage.

40     I will first start with the allegations that the Defendant had been physically abusive towards the Plaintiff and \[Child 1\], as stated in paragraph 3(j) of the Plaintiff Statement of Particulars, which included assertions that the Defendant had struck the Plaintiff during the Penang trip in 1996 for cutting her toenails, and that the Defendant had removed his belt to strike her.

41     I accepted the Defendant’s submission that this was a one-off incident which occurred 24 years ago and that the Plaintiff continued to remain in the marriage despite the incident. It is found, on a balance of probabilities that the Defendant was not physically abusive to the Plaintiff. I agreed with the Defendant’s submission that this cannot constitute behaviour that the Plaintiff cannot reasonably be expected to continue to live with him given that she had done so for more than 2 decades ago.

42     Similarly, for the Plaintiff’s assertion that the Defendant had been physically abusive towards \[Child 1\][^103], including the allegation that the Defendant had held \[Child 1\]’s hands against a hot and boiling pot as punishment back in 1996, and that the Defendant had abused \[Child 1\] by striking and slapping him on or around 11 May 2008, I agree with the Defendant’s submissions these incidents occurred many years ago and yet the Plaintiff had continued to live with the Defendant despite all these incidents.[^104]

43     It is found, on a balance of probabilities, that the Defendant was not abusive to \[Child 1\], and even if he was, this was not behaviour that the Plaintiff cannot reasonably be expected to live with him.

44     One of the facts relied upon by the Plaintiff is that of the Defendant’s history of psychological abuse towards the Plaintiff, which included an inappropriate encounter with his niece in 2008. It is found, on a balance of probabilities, that the Defendant did commit an act of sexual indiscretion with his young niece.

45     While there is evidence that the Defendant had committed sexual indiscretion with his niece, the Plaintiff did not file for divorce back then and continued to live with the Defendant despite her knowledge of this incident in 2011. This cannot be behaviour used to prove that the Plaintiff cannot reasonably be expected to live with him. There is evidence that parties went on trips in 2018, including the trip which the Plaintiff described as a “last shot I had for the marriage after the past 8 years of turmoil”[^105].

46     Finally, the Plaintiff has alleged that the Defendant does not and has not contributed financially to the marriage.

47     In the present case, it cannot be said that the Defendant did not contribute financially to the marriage as there was evidence that he was paying for the marketing expenses for the family, including that of the mother-in-law’s house. I had also accepted that he had contributed to the improvement works for the matrimonial home although it is not necessary for me to make any findings on the exact extent of such improvement works. However, there is sufficient evidence, on a balance of probabilities, to show that the Defendant had allowed the Plaintiff to shoulder the financial burden of the family, had been financially irresponsible and had taken financial advantage of the Plaintiff to her detriment[^106].

48     This was a case where the ongoing cumulative effect of the Defendant’s behaviour was to be considered. While on their own, some of the allegations raised by the Plaintiff may be considered trivial but taking into account the cumulative effect of the behaviour of the Defendant through the years and the personality of the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff had established that the Defendant had behaved in such a way that the Plaintiff could not be expected to live with him.

49     The Defendant did not deny that he had incurred debts in the past, which put the family’s financial well-being at risk and it appeared from the evidence that the Plaintiff had repeatedly rescued him from his financial woes in the course of the marriage. As stated earlier, when the Plaintiff’s counsel stated during cross-examination that the Defendant was “happy to let (the Plaintiff) continue to bear the financial burden of the family”[^107], the Defendant did not deny this and explained that it was because he did not want any confrontation.

50     While the Defendant’s position is that the marriage is on “solid grounds”[^108] and that it does not merit the Plaintiff using “unreasonable behaviour” for divorce as he had been on his best behaviour for the past 5 years[^109], the evidence showed that it was not because there were no deep-seated problems between the parties but that they did not openly discuss the underlying conflict between them in order to avoid fighting. The Defendant acknowledged that there was “an outstanding amount” of “money that (they) didn’t address, (they) didn’t resolve.”[^110] When questioned by the Plaintiff’s counsel as to why he did not pay the Plaintiff the outstanding amount, he answered that they “never talked about it” because they had a “dispute over whether it’s $30,000 or $70,000” so if they brought the topic again, he was of the view that it would “end up in another big fight”. [^111] It was clear from the evidence that the undercurrents remained on this issue of finances and the marriage remained volatile. There was a lack of transparency and communication on financial matters between the parties.

51     The marriage was in a state of deterioration back in 2014 to the extent that even the Defendant knew that the Plaintiff had already considered filing for divorce and that she had also consulted her lawyers regarding a divorce in 2014[^112]. It was unfortunate that the parties’ eldest son, \[Child 1\], had to step in to salvage his parent’s marriage by drafting an agreement between them dated 23rd November 2014. Sadly, but not surprisingly, this agreement merely gave a temporary appearance of truce when the Defendant conceded[^113] that he still breached the agreement[^114] as he was “not transparent”[^115]. The Defendant also did not deny that he had failed to adhere to the other clauses in the agreement that included that which required parties to “ _remain honest and transparent at all times and will not incur any debt (credit card, credit lines, or loans of any sort) without discussing it first with my spouse_” and _“not put (their spouse in a position of being surprised by (his/her) deed or actions”._

52     The marriage was far from being on “solid grounds” as described by the Defendant. It was clear that there was a lack of trust in terms of the Defendant’s management of his finances and the Defendant knew that this issue was hanging over their heads even from 2015 onwards. I agreed with the Plaintiff’s position that the defence of a harmonious marriage relied on by (the Defendant) lacked credibility on all fronts.[^116]

53     When questioned by the Plaintiff’s counsel about what were the financial matters that he still wanted to talk to the Plaintiff about[^117], part of the Defendant’s answer was as follows:

> _“Okay. I feel like our problem, uh, started in December 2013 when (the Plaintiff) took a loan for me on my behalf because I was having some debts at that time. Uh, the reason why I was having some debts at that time was because there was some changes in the work arrangement so, there was salary cards and so on, on---all of a sudden I found myself, uh, in debt and I asked (the Plaintiff) to help me. At that time, I was aware that I was having some debts that would amount to about 30 something thousand. So, when I went to Citibank with her to take the loan, um, I didn’t know exactly how much she was taking because I never got any documentation or anything like that…....….so that started a chain of events where things were really rough in my house in the year 2014 because she keeps—she kept insisting that I owed her like in my email prior there, uh, yah. I wrote to her on the 30th of June to talk about the $30,000 debt because that was my understanding and, uh, somehow that was not her understanding and so we had a difference of view. I can’t see how I should pay for my insurance premium with—with the $1,000 I had left………._

> _And when you asked me this question about what is it that I want to talk about, is because this was the crux of the problem from here, December 13th that loan, it has escalated into a lot of other things that has happened in my—in our marriage which has become a big problem, you know, so, but for the last 5 years we never talked about money. So we didn’t address it.”[^118]_

54     It is clear, even from the Defendant’s own testimony, that it was not that the marriage was on “solid ground” as described by the Defendant, but rather, there was a breakdown in communication on the issue of finances between the parties and there were no fights not because the issue was resolved but because parties did not address it to prevent further escalation.

55     I found the Plaintiff to be a credible witness from her demeanour and accepted her evidence that the Plaintiff had asked the Defendant to repay her for what he owed her before the 2019 incident, as stated in her testimony as follows:

> _“…. On numerous occasions, you have see the emails. I have asked him to please help out sometimes when I need money to pay for, let’s say, the children’s education or certain things around the house. Help me out here. I am stretched beyond belief. His response was always, “(Plaintiff), I have no money.” Yet a credit card debt will appear. Yet you go out and buy a $5000 gym membership. Yet you go out and buy 2 bicycles. You have a motorbike. It ended for me in January 2019 when despite having a conversation with him a few months prior to that where I asked him, “Can you please pay me back some of the money you owe me?” And he said “(Plaintiff), I have no money.” But when he has a disagreement with me on the car, he goes out and takes a $36,000 loan. Who do you think is going to be eventually responsible for that loan again? Me.”[^119]_

56     As stated earlier, the Defendant did not deny that there was such a conversation where the Plaintiff had asked him to return her the money owed. When questioned by the Plaintiff’s counsel as to whether he recalled that there was a conversation where the Plaintiff had told him that she was pressed for money and needed his help, and where the Defendant had answered the Plaintiff that he had no money, the Defendant testified that he did not remember when did such a conversation took place and neither did he remember the details of such a conversation[^120]although he did not deny that there was such a conversation.

## Is this behaviour that the Plaintiff cannot reasonably be expected to live with the Defendant?

57     It was in the context of such history of past incidents of breach of trust and lack of transparency on the part of the Defendant - including the encashing of \[Child 3\]’s tuition teacher’s cheque, changing of the percentage of CPF contributions in the past, and being aware that there was outstanding amount of money owing to the Plaintiff yet with the amount remained unsettled, that the January 2019 incident happened. This was an incident that broke whatever that was left of the brittle trust that the Plaintiff had in the Defendant, and a catalyst for the underlying tension between them to re-surface.

58     While the Defendant has expressed the view in his opening statement that the January 2019 incident in itself is insufficient to prove unreasonable behaviour, it is clear from case law that it is the cumulative effect of various incidents that occurred during the course of the marriage to constitute behaviour within the meaning of the provision.

59     The Plaintiff had agreed to allow the Defendant to use her car to pick his friend up after cycling, on the condition that he did not mount the bicycle rack and/or the bicycle on the car. The Defendant seemingly agreed to this with the Plaintiff but then, in the next moment, did exactly what he promised not to do to and scratched the back of the Plaintiff’s car.

60     To the Plaintiff, this was the proverbial straw that broke the camel’s back and had infuriated her as she felt that what this has shown her was his inability to keep the promises he has made, and that he could not be trusted. This resulted in the Plaintiff telling the Defendant to never use her car again. Within a week following the incident, the Defendant took out a loan amounting to approximately $36,000 to purchase a weekend car of his own. This had upset her further as despite his claims that he had no money or that he had yet to repay her what is owing to her, he saw it fit to purchase a car. Even though the Defendant had explained that he had purchased the car for \[Child 2\], this did not justify his purchase especially when he knew he still owed the Plaintiff a considerable sum of money which she expected to be returned to her. It is also \[Child 2\]’s evidence that the Defendant had never once presented the car to her as a birthday present and she had trouble believing that the Defendant intended the car for her.

61     The irony is that by his act in 2019, the Defendant had yet again displayed financially irresponsible behaviour that would have breached the terms of the signed agreement drafted by \[Child 1\]. The Defendant had incurred a loan without discussing it first with his spouse. The Defendant had also put his spouse in a position of being surprised by his actions. The terms of the agreement clearly summarised the repeated pattern of the Defendant’s behaviour which was already causing problems in the parties’ marriage back in 2014, which was known even to their young son who had tried, in a commendable manner, to draw some boundaries in written terms to rein in his father’s irresponsible conduct.

62     I was of the view that the incidents of financial irresponsibility cited by the Plaintiff were not merely isolated “one-off” incidents but showed a pattern of behaviour by the Defendant throughout the years of marriage. While it cannot be said that the Defendant does not and has not contributed financially to the marriage, the Defendant was “happy to let (the Plaintiff) continue to bear the financial burden of the family”[^121]. It is found, on a balance probabilities that the Defendant had been financially irresponsible to the detriment of the Plaintiff– that he had disregarded the Plaintiff’s interest and views by taking on a loan of $36,000 to purchase a car when he should have prioritised returning her the monies owing to her. The Defendant’s behaviour in the last incident in January 2019 has demonstrated yet another act of financial irresponsibility which had occurred in the course of their marriage, such that it is no longer reasonable to expect the Plaintiff to accept and live with him.

63     The Defendant had submitted[^122] that incidents before 2018 should be disregarded because parties have “reconciled” especially when there was physical intimacy during the trip to Taj Mahal[^123]. First, I agree with Plaintiff’s submissions that the Defendant has not pleaded a reconciliation between the Plaintiff and himself and his Defence is silent in this regard. Secondly, the Court must consider the cumulative effect of behaviour displayed by a spouse for determining whether a spouse had behaved in such a way that the other spouse has behaved in such a way that the other spouse cannot reasonably be expected to live with him/her.

64     The Defendant had cited the case of _VBZ v VBA_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 119</span> (“_VBZ v VBA_”) to support his case on this issue. I am of the view that the facts in _VBZ v VBA_ differs from our case. In _VBZ v VBA_, the husband continued living together with the wife (which he says has displayed unreasonable behaviour) as a family from December 2017 (last incident) to July 2018. There was evidence that there was reconciliation after the last incident of December 2017. The wife was still expected to attend the husband’s mother’s birthday party. They were still living together, sharing meals, having interactions as a family, including with the husband’s mother, and sharing a domestic helper. In that case, the husband only concluded that he could no longer be expected to continue living with the wife when he finally formed the decision with the view that the marriage was over and left in July 2018. The husband conceded in that case that the final incident in December 2017 did not cause the breakdown of the family.

65     DJ Jen Koh at \[57\] of _VBZ v VBA_ explained that the case before her was not a case where she could consider the cumulative complaints of the wife’s conduct raised by the husband to determine the breakdown of the marriage because the husband had reconciled with the wife on several occasions - there was “a conscious and considered decision on his part as left the wife on three separate occasions, forgave her, reconciled with her and resumed cohabitation with her as a married couple.” DJ Jen Koh at \[17\] of her decision stated that “any incidents he referred to prior to December 2017 would have been forgiven/condoned with his staying on in the marriage with the wife, continuing in the marriage and specifically, reconciling with her. The weight to be placed on incidents prior to December 2017 would be minimal, if at all, bearing in mind the applicability of Section 95(6)”.

66     This clearly differs from the facts of our case. There was no evidence that after the final incident on January 2019 the Plaintiff had forgiven/condoned the Defendant or acted in any manner to express any intention in continuing in the marriage or wanting to reconcile with the Defendant.

67     In the circumstances of the case, it cannot be said to be reasonable to expect the wife to accept and live with him. It is obvious that the Plaintiff’s patience and trust had been exhausted by the cumulative effect of the Defendant’s financial irresponsibility and erosion of trust over the years and the realisation that there was hardly any prospects of the Defendant mending his ways. I find that due to the cumulative effect of the Defendant’s behaviour during the marriage to January 2019, it would be unreasonable to expect the Plaintiff in this case to continue to live with him.

## Should the Defendant’s depression be taken into consideration and to what extent should his depression be taken into consideration?

68     In determining whether the Defendant had behaved in such a way that the Plaintiff could not reasonably be expected to live with him, the Court had to take into account all the reasons for the defendant’s behaviour including the effects of depression. In this regard, the Plaintiff highlighted the case of _Teo Hoon Ping v Tan Lay Ying Angeline_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 1 SLR 691</span> where the Court of Appeal stated that while the Court does have to “_take into account all the reasons for the defendant’s behaviour, including the effects of depression”_, “_the weight that would be given to an excuse based on the defendant’s depression depended on many factors such as the nature and severity of the defendant’s mental illness, the kind of treatment which the plaintiff had suffered, and the strength of the causative link between the defendant’s illness and the behaviour which he or she had inflicted on the plaintiff.”[^124]_

69     Even though the Defendant has attributed his behaviour to his persistent depressive disorder, I agree with the Plaintiff’s submissions that he has failed to establish a causative link between his depression and unreasonable behaviour. The Defendant did not call Dr \[C\] from Novena Psychiatry Clinic as a witness, but merely adduced a short letter/report of two pages from Dr \[C\] dated 29 February 2020 in his affidavit[^125]. The letter/report was rather brief and there was nothing conclusive from this letter/report to state how the Defendant’s behaviour can be attributed to his condition or suggest a causative link. In fact, Dr \[C\] had “advised (the Defendant) to consult the Credit Counselling Singapore so as to clear his debts and manage his finances” which gave one the impression that Dr \[C\] was of the view that the Defendant’s mismanagement of his finances was better dealt with through counselling besides his treatment for depression.[^126] On the severity of the illness, it also appeared that the Defendant had stopped seeing Dr \[C\] after 11 March 2016, and “he reported that his mood has improved”. I have therefore given little weight to the effects of his depression in assessing whether he has acted in such a way that the Plaintiff can no longer reasonably be expected to continue living with him. The Defendant had not presented any conclusive evidence to prove that his depression was responsible for his behaviour towards the Plaintiff.

## Did the parties live with each other for a period of more than 6 months after the date of the occurrence of the final incident relied upon by the Plaintiff? If so, should that fact be regarded in determining whether or not the Plaintiff can reasonably be expected to live with the Defendant?

70     The Defendant had also submitted[^127] that since the parties had cohabited for a period for more than 6 months after the date of the occurrence of the final incident relied upon by the Plaintiff, the fact should be disregarded in determining whether or not the Plaintiff can be reasonably be expected to live with the Defendant.

71     In determining whether parties “have lived with each other for a period after the date of the occurrence of the final incident” which in our case is the incident in January 2019, I am inclined to adopt a practical approach in deciding whether parties continued to live together. While parties remained under the same roof after the final incident, there is scarcely any communication between parties and they carried on their daily life with no reference to the other - they had no conjugal relations since the last incident in January 2019 and were already living separate lives. The Defendant had stated that he had been alienated from the family and that he did not know what has been going on in the family, and had ceased to have meals or outings together since then[^128].

72     The Defendant had in his submission cited the case of _UZW v UZX \[2019_\] SGFC 91 where DJ Sheik Mustafa opined:

> “\[_60\] The difference extends to the provision regarding the plaintiff living with the defendant after discovering the adultery or unreasonable behaviour. For adultery, if the parties continue to live with each other for more than 6 months, then the plaintiff is not entitled to rely on the ground of adultery altogether. For unreasonable behaviour, it is not absolutely fatal to the plaintiff’s case, instead it is left to the court to decide on whether or not the continued living together defeats or mitigates how reasonable it would be to expect the plaintiff to live with the defendant”_

> _\[61\] On examination of the facts of the case, even if it can be said that the wife continued to live with the husband for more than 6 months after the final incident, her case of unreasonable behaviour is not defeated. The wife’s continued residency with the husband was evidently precipitated out of necessity and lack of options. The wife’s behaviour in that period does not show any acceptance or forgiveness of the husband’s behaviour_.”

73     I agree with DJ Sheik Mustafa in the case of _UZW v UZX_ who has made it clear that Section 95(6) of the Act is not an absolute bar to an application for divorce under Section 95(3)(b) of the Act.

74     There is no evidence to show that the Plaintiff condoned, tolerated or forgave, even temporarily, the behaviour complained of. While the Plaintiff is financially capable, I note from the evidence that she is very close to her children and would find it necessary to remain under the same roof as the children in the midst of divorce proceedings. I accepted her testimony that she had asked him to “move out or move down” and when he refused, slept on the bed with the pillow in between. She had then moved out of the room and has now been sleeping on the small sofa single bed[^129]. In the circumstances, the final incident should still be regarded in determining whether or not the Plaintiff can be reasonably expected to live with the Defendant.

## Is there a possibility of reconciliation between the parties?

75     The possibility of reconciliation was considered. It is found that there is none. I have noted that both parties were adamant in their respective positions. The Plaintiff was insistent on ending the marriage, and Defendant was insistent that he wanted to save the marriage. The Plaintiff’s testimony expressed her view that there was no room for reconciliation and she had described the car incident as “a nail on the coffin”[^130]. She longer wanted to continue in the marriage.

76     Based on the evidence before me, I was of the view that on a balance of probabilities, the Defendant has indeed displayed unreasonable behaviour towards the Plaintiff such that she can no longer be reasonably expected to continue living with him. I had therefore granted the interim judgment based on the Plaintiff’s claim and ordered the Defendant to pay the Plaintiff costs fixed at $12,000.
