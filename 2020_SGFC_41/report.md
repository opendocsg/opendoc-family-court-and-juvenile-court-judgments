Material change in circumstances, maintenance, variation

27 April 2020

### District Judge Lim Keng Yeow:

1       The parties were married on 23 June 1984. Their marriage was dissolved on 4 May 2009 with the granting of the Interim Judgment, which was made Final on 26 August 2009.

2       The Interim Judgment contained orders made by consent (“the Consent Orders”), covering all ancillary matters between the parties. Before me, the Applicant/ex-Husband (“the Applicant”) sought to vary two of those orders:

> a)     Paragraph 3(3): monthly maintenance of the Respondent/ex-Wife (“the Respondent”), and

> b)     Paragraph 3(12): sale of the parties’ Sunrise Garden property.

3       I made orders varying both paragraphs of the Consent Orders. Following that, both parties filed appeals directed _only_ at my decision as regards monthly maintenance for the Respondent. These Grounds address the cross appeals, dealing only with issues concerning maintenance.

4       Paragraph 3(3) of the Consent Orders required the Applicant to pay the Respondent $8,000 monthly for her maintenance[^1]. In this application, he sought a downward variation to the sum of $3,000, relying on a material change in circumstances[^2]. I allowed a reduction of monthly maintenance, but only to $5,000.

5       For the Applicant to succeed in his application, he had to show two things:

> a)     The _existence_ of a material change, so as to justify a variation of the consent orders, and

> b)     The _extent_ of the material change, so as to justify the reduction sought.

6       The Applicant asserted that, with his retirement, his income had dropped from a monthly salary of over $33,000 per month to an approximate monthly amount of some $13,500 per month. As a result, he claimed to now earn 40% of what he used to. In addition, his current monthly source of income was through director’s fees and board committee fees, meaning that he did not get a fixed salary. He further argued[^3] that a large reduction was also appropriate as the existing orders should not be read or applied as to encourage lifelong dependency on him, and that the Respondent ought to regain self-sufficiency.

7       For essentially those reasons, he contended that the maintenance figure should drop to $3,000, representing a 37.5% drop from $8,000.

8       The Respondent did not dispute the fact of the Applicant’s retirement and accepted the existence of a material change in circumstances. What she disputed was the true extent of the change. She claimed that the true state of his finances was not disclosed as he had extensive experience in investments given the nature of his work all these years, and had refused to answer her Interrogatories relating to his other sources of income. An adverse inference should be drawn against him and a reduction to $3,000 would not be justified. She also contended that maintenance should be paid to her on a lump-sum basis.

9       I accepted that the Applicant’s monthly _employment_ remuneration had dropped by 40% as a result of his retirement. What was far less clear was the true extent to which his _overall_ income, which could consist of revenue streams beyond his immediate employment, had gone down.

10     I decided on a reduction of monthly maintenance to $5,000 instead of $3,000 as sought by the Applicant, essentially for these two reasons:

> a)     An adverse inference ought to be drawn against the Applicant for his refusal to answer the Respondent’s Interrogatories concerning his other sources of income, and

> b)     The burden of proof fell on the Applicant to show that his overall income had fallen to the extent that a reduction of monthly maintenance by 37.5% to $3,000 would be justified, and he had not been able to discharge that burden on a balance of probabilities.

11     In deciding that an adverse inference against the Applicant was necessary, I accepted that the issue of income from other sources such as investments, beyond employment income, was especially pertinent in this case. There were two reasons for this.

12     Firstly, the existence of other income sources was not merely a matter of conjecture or even reasonable inference. Applicant had admitted that he did earn dividends from his portfolio of shares in his Central Depository account operated by the Singapore Stock Exchange[^4]. However, he did not give any details of these, asserting that after the division of matrimonial assets, these details were irrelevant.

13     Secondly, the profile of the Applicant was relevant. It was not disputed that he had vast and deep experience in investments, having worked in this area for many years. In particular, he served as a senior management staff at the \[B\][^5] Limited, a major renowned entity dealing with shares, investments and corporate listings. He was described by the organisation as having made significant contributions for 12 years, particularly in the area of corporate listings and to their China business, as Head of China[^6]. He was certainly no ordinary man-in-the-street as far as investments, stocks and shares were concerned.

14     It was against this background that the Respondent’s solicitors sent a Request for Interrogatories seeking information on his other sources of income (i.e. rental income, bonuses, dividends etc). Nonetheless, the Applicant refused to provide answers, alleging that the Respondent was merely fishing for information and attempting to get another bite of the cherry as regards the division of property. There was no indication of any inability to provide any of the information.

15     In my judgment, the refusal and allegations were both wholly unjustified. The circumstances behoved the Applicant to provide a full and frank disclosure of his overall financial circumstances. After all, under s 114(1)(a) WC, what the court has to consider in determining the amount of maintenance to be paid is not only a party’s “income and earning capacity, but also one’s “_property_ and _other financial resources_” (italics added). As a result, the Applicant’s refusal to provide the information sought ought to attract an adverse inference against him.

16     In addition, the Applicant had also fallen short of providing his bank statements, as required in paragraph 77(12) of the Family Justice Courts Practice Directions, and did not show that the information could not be made available. This also provides some support for the drawing of an adverse inference against him.

17     Quite apart from the adverse inference and perhaps alternatively to that, the Applicant’s refusal and/or failure to produce the above information also meant that he could not discharge the burden that fell upon him. As the applicant, he had to show the true extent to which his overall financial resources and income has dropped, so as to support the contention that the corresponding reduction in monthly maintenance should be to $3,000, but he did not do so.

18     In this regard, I found it pertinent to note what the parties had agreed to in the Consent Orders. Paragraph 3(4) of the said orders comes after the paragraph setting out the monthly maintenance amount, and provides for the following:

> In the event of a change of circumstances of both parties, especially with reference to the Defendant \[the Applicant\] being unable to be in continuous employment and his income is reduced significantly i.e. by not less than 20% of his _current annual income_, both parties are given liberty to apply for a variation of the monthly maintenance to the Plaintiff \[the Respondent\]. \[Italics added\]

19     Here, the parties provided for what would happen when the Applicant would no longer be in continuous employment. But their agreement was that his retirement, by itself, was _insufficient_ to warrant any variation of the maintenance. They specifically provided that, _despite his retirement_, his _annual_ income had to drop by at least 20%. In my view, that clearly meant that consideration of income streams _other than_ his monthly employment was necessary.

20     I am mindful that the paragraph is to be read primarily in relation to the _existence_ of a material change in circumstances. That issue is not in dispute before me. In my view, it is also relevant in determining the _extent_ of the material changes. That is because it reveals the spirit of their agreement: when the issue of variation is dealt with, it is not merely the Applicant’s monthly employment income that matters, and his income from extraneous sources such as dividends, which may not be payable on a monthly basis, also need to be considered.

21     Flowing from the above, for the Applicant to discharge his burden, he had to provide sufficient information concerning his overall financial resources, including any existing sources of income such as rental income, bonuses and dividends. Failure to do so would defeat his contentions as to the appropriate reduction to be ordered.

22     I concluded that the Applicant cannot justify the reduction in maintenance to $3,000 without due evidence that his _overall_ income had fallen correspondingly. Hence, while I was prepared to grant a reduction in view of his retirement, I did not allow the reduction he sought. Based on the evidence before me, I decided that a reduction to $5,000 would be just and equitable.

23     I did not find it appropriate to set a higher amount given that his income may now be neither fixed nor stable. I also did not consider the issue of the Respondent’s expenses or allegations that they were inflated to carry much weight. This application would turn predominantly on the extent of material changes in circumstances. The Respondent’s expenses are only relevant if there is a material change thereto from the circumstances at the time of the Consent Order.

24     I go on to address the other issues raised by both parties.

25     The Applicant also contended, citing the Court of Appeal decision in _ATE v ATD_[^7] that the reduction he sought was necessary because a maintenance order ought not to create lifelong dependence, and the Respondent ought to try to regain self-sufficiency. He also argued that the Respondent was, in any event, well provided for under the ancillary orders, and that this ought to be considered in deciding on the variation.

26     In my view, nothing turned on these arguments. While the principle in _ATE v ATD_ cannot be ignored when a maintenance order is made, the parties are free to enter into agreements for reasons of their own choosing. The court’s role is primarily to enquire into the existence of any vitiating factors underlying the agreement. Where there are none (as in this case), the court ought to honour and, as far as possible, give effect to the agreement freely entered into by them.

27     In my view, the parties’ intentions were plainly set out in the Consent Order. It clearly did not provide for or contemplate an end-date in relation to spousal maintenance. It also did not build-in the expectation for the Respondent to gain self-sufficiency, whether through employment or through the assets awarded to her.

28     I noted that much of that probably had to do with how the parties managed their respective roles within the household. The Respondent became a homemaker and had not worked since 1990, which was 4 years after parties were married and around the time the older child was born. By the time of the Interim Judgment, she had already been out of the workforce for some 19 years, and was aged 62 when the matter came before me. In the circumstances, the Applicant’s claims that she ought to gain self-sufficiency rang hollow.

29     The division of assets served a different purpose from maintenance and carries little or no weight in this application. Even the Consent Order treated the two as distinct and independent of each other. Hence I declined to accept the Applicant’s arguments and saw no reason to either ignore or refuse to honour the parties’ agreement.

30     In the course of responding to the application, the Respondent also argued for the consideration of lump sum maintenance in her favour. The issue should not warrant full consideration as the Respondent had not made any application concerning this. Hence, I leave open the issue to be determined in a subsequent application, if any. I did, however, read the parties’ submissions on this issue.

31     For completeness, or in case I am wrong to hold back consideration of the matter, I would briefly state that I was not persuaded of the merits of this request. There is nothing in the Consent Order which supports this, and this would in fact be contrary to what was agreed to between the parties, something I held the Applicant to and ought likewise to hold the Respondent to. Furthermore, applying the principles in _AYM v AYL_[^8], the facts here are insufficient to make a lump sum order necessary.

32     For all the above reasons, I decided that spousal maintenance for the Respondent should be reduced to $5,000. I made the following order as a result:

> Clause 3(3) of the Order of Court dated 9 April 2009 is varied to read as follows:

>> The Defendant \[the Applicant\] shall pay to the Plaintiff \[the Respondent\] maintenance of $5,000 per month from 1 February 2020 and thereafter on the 1st day of each month into her POSB account no. XXX.
