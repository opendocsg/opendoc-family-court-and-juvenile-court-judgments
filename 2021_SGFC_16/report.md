Relocation, Care And Access Of Child

24 February 2021

### District Judge Toh Wee San:

1       This was an application by the Plaintiff husband to seek the return of his child to India, joint custody and sole care and control of the child, with reasonable access to the child for the Defendant wife. The Plaintiff will be referred to as the “Husband” and the Defendant will be referred to as the “Wife”.

2       At the hearing, I indicated that I was inclined to order that the child stays on in Singapore and parties care for the child jointly. Parties were invited to submit their views on this suggestion. After the hearing, I issued my orders in November 2020. I ordered that the child shall stay on in Singapore and both sides shall have joint custody and care over the child from 1st March 2021. Meanwhile, I gave the Husband a few hours of access during the week and on the weekend. I increased the duration of the Husband’s access incrementally and to include overnights during the transition to March 2021. I also ordered that the child shall be accompanied by a familiar caregiver which both sides agreed on. I allowed both sides to travel with the child from 1st June 2021 and each side shall take turns to keep the child’s passport. The child was not permitted to travel out of Singapore by an interim order, before my present order. A copy of my court order is annexed. The Wife appealed against my orders, followed by the Husband. I provide my reasons below.

## Background

3       The parties were married on 11 July 2013 in Mumbai, India. There is one child, a daughter, to the marriage, born on 14 November 2017. The child is currently three years old. Both parties and the child are Indian nationals and they are not Singapore Permanent Residents presently. After the marriage, the parties resided in India. The Wife’s family resided in Singapore.

4       Unfortunately, in May 2018, the Wife suffered a brain hemorrhage and was comatose when the child was about 6 months old. Thereafter, the Wife went abroad to the United States and Switzerland for treatment. The Husband, the child, and parties’ families accompanied and visited the Wife for some durations. Both sides differed in their opinions regarding each side’s extent of care for the child before the move to Singapore.

5       The marriage broke down around end-2019 and parties decided to end the relationship. In January 2020, the parties agreed to certain terms of the divorce (“Consent Terms”) and mutually commenced divorce proceedings in India.

6       The agreement in the Consent Terms was that parties will have joint custody of the child with care and control to the Wife. It was also part of the Consent Terms that the Wife and the child will reside in Singapore and the Husband will have unrestricted access to the child, including overnight access and overseas access.[^1] However, the Wife later withdrew her consent after bringing the child to Singapore and refused to give effect to the Consent Terms.

## Legal test for the current application

7       The legal test for the current application is the best interest of the child.

8       Section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act (Cap. 122) provides that the child’s welfare is the first and paramount consideration when the court determines issues in relation to custody or upbringing of the child.

9       In Singapore, there was no default rule in favour of either sole or shared care and control orders. The High Court cases have provided guidance that while hostility may result in practical difficulties, there is also a fine line between the perverse incentive of artificial acrimony and the perverse outcome of an unworkable order.

## Parties’ positions in brief

### The Husband’s position

10     The Husband claimed that pursuant to the Consent Terms, the Wife and the child came to Singapore on a permanent basis in March 2020. However, in May 2020, the Wife submitted her withdrawal of consent in India on the basis that she had signed and consented to the Consent Terms under duress.[^2] The Husband disagreed and argued that the Wife had reneged on the Consent Terms to deprive him of access to the child even though he was in Singapore.[^3] In fact, the Husband stated that since April 2020 the Wife had unilaterally imposed restrictions on his access with the child. The Husband argued that since the Wife had reneged on the Consent Terms, he was not bound by the terms and was open to seek care and control of the child.[^4]

11     The Husband submitted that it would be in the child’s best interest for him to have sole care and control of the child, and for the child to return to Mumbai with him. The Husband argued that the Wife suffers from an ongoing medical condition that renders her unable and incapable of taking care of the child without the help and support of others[^5]. The Husband stated that the Wife can speak only key words and needs someone to support her to walk with her. Her right hand has limited mobility and is unusable/paralysed.[^6] The Husband argued that the Wife is dependent on others to look after herself and the child. On this basis, the Husband submitted that it would be in the child’s best interest to be placed in the care of the parent who is able to look after her needs and not have a “surrogate” parent look after her.[^7]

12     Despite the medical report furnished by the Wife where her neurologist opined that she was able to care for the child, the Husband argued that the doctor had not provided any basis in reaching this conclusion. The Husband had also instructed a Private Investigator (PI) to conduct surveillance on the Wife to determine her ability to care independently for the child. The PI report dated 12 October 2020 was exhibited in the Husband’s affidavit filed on 7 November 2020 (previously filed under the cover of his solicitor’s affidavit filed on 14 October 2020).

13     The Husband argued that he had looked after the child with the help of his parents ever since the child was born in November 2017 until the child was brought to Boston in June 2018.[^8] In addition, when the Wife suffered from brain haemorrhage and could not attend to the child’s daily needs due to the several operations, therapy and rehabilitation that she gone through, he looked after the child’s needs such as feeding, changing her diapers, engaging her in activities, brought her on play dates, holidays, etc.[^9] The Husband submitted that the Wife had downplayed his role in looking after the child and the support from his parents. The Husband also argued that he was able to dedicate time to care for the child in view of his flexible working arrangements that allowed him to return home in the afternoon to spend time with the child until her bedtime.[^10] He further mentioned that he had made arrangements to get employment in Singapore to obtain an Employment Pass so that he can spend as much time as possible with the child.[^11]

14     The Husband also submitted that the Wife lacked good faith. The Husband argued that the Wife had unreasonably restricted his access to the child even though he was in Singapore.[^12] The Husband categorically denied the Wife’s allegations that he had kidnapped the child[^13] and also referred to the Wife’s conduct when she brought the child to Singapore but then reneged on the Consent Terms and insisted that the status quo should remain and that the child ought to reside in Singapore.[^14] The Husband further argued that the Wife was a flight risk and capable of bringing the child out of Singapore with the help of her family members. He mentioned that she could easily uproot herself from Singapore as she did not have a base in Singapore and was merely dependant on her parents for care and rehabilitation and would follow them if need be.[^15]

15     The Husband argued that should the court grant care and control to him, the ideal situation would be to bring the child back to Mumbai where she spent the bulk of her time in.[^16] The Husband highlighted that the child was born in India and would have remained in Mumbai but for the Consent Terms that the Wife subsequently reneged on.[^17]

16     However, the Husband also took the position that he was willing to stay in Singapore as he had secured an Employment Pass and he had found suitable accommodation which was very near the Wife and the child’s school in Sentosa. The Husband argued that he had arranged his life to prioritise the child’s needs and her daily schedule.[^18] He would hire a domestic helper to support him to jointly care for the child.[^19]

### The Wife’s position

17     The Wife argued that her withdrawal of her consent to the Divorce Petition in India and the Consent Terms was not relevant to the current application as she was entitled under Indian law to withdraw her consent within the statutory cooling-off period of 6 months.[^20] Furthermore, she stated that the Husband was neither seeking to mirror the orders of the Consent Terms in the present application[^21] nor were the Consent Terms implemented by the parties.[^22] In addition, the Wife argued that she would be entitled to sole care and control of the child under Indian law.[^23]

18     The Wife also explained that she withdrew her consent to the Divorce Petition and the Consent Terms because she was under duress and that the Husband had kidnapped the child on 12 December 2019 when he took the child from Mumbai to another town in India without informing the Wife beforehand and remained uncontactable for several hours.[^24] The Husband admitted that the incident happened but did not agree that he had kidnapped the child.

19     The Wife argued that the Husband’s application should be dismissed in its entirety. She argued that it would not be in the child’s best interest for the Husband to be granted sole care and control. To that end, the Wife submitted that it would be in the child’s best interest and welfare for status quo to remain and for the child to continue under the care of the Wife. The Wife disagreed with the Husband’s arguments that her medical condition rendered her unable to care for the child. The Wife highlighted that this was contrary to the position that he took in January 2020 under the Consent Terms where he had agreed for the child to be under the Wife’s care.[^25] It was an afterthought by the Husband as he had no qualms of placing the child under her care for more than a month when the Wife, her family members and the child went to Switzerland for treatment and thereafter to Singapore.[^26]

20     The Wife stated that she has made progressive and significant recovery and referred to the medical reports that she had furnished in her affidavit.[^27] Notwithstanding this, the Wife submitted that her medical condition had never impeded her care of the child and referred to her involvement in the child’s daily routine, the child’s school-related activities, etc.[^28] Furthermore, the Wife argued that it is not uncommon for grandparents to assist in the care of grandchildren and the mere fact that the Wife required assistance from her parents is not reflective of any inability on her part.[^29]

21     The Wife argued that contrary to the Husband’s position, he was constantly preoccupied with work and his social life even during the time when she sought treatment for her brain haemorrhage. The Husband would leave the Wife and the child to be cared for by her family and would spend 30 minutes playing with the child each day at the most.[^30] The Wife further argued that the Husband had kidnapped the child to another town in India a few days after parties had a tense discussion over the divorce. The Husband had only brought the child back to Mumbai after his parents persuaded him to. She further averred that the Husband continued to threaten to run away with the child if she did not agree to his terms in the Divorce Petition in India and the Consent Terms.

22     The Wife reiterated that she has been the child’s primary caregiver since birth and continued to be an involved parent who took care of the child’s needs after her recovery from the brain haemorrhage.[^31] The child has been residing with her together with the Wife’s family members since January 2020 and has been sleeping with the Wife every night to date.[^32] The Wife disagreed with the Husband’s position that she had restricted his access to her. The Wife averred that she had facilitated the Husband’s access with the child when he was in Singapore and even when he returned to India through daily electronic access.[^33] The Wife mentioned that the Husband’s complaint was that he had not been able to exercise access to the child as per the Consent Terms.[^34] However, the Wife argued that it was not in the child’s best interest to adhere to the Consent Terms such as to allow overnight access to the Husband when the child was accustomed to sleeping together with the Wife and had never slept with the Husband. The Wife also raised her concerns that the Husband would kidnap the child again if her family members did not accompany him for his access.[^35] In any event, the Wife reiterated that the Consent Terms had been withdrawn. The Wife submitted that it would be in the child’s best interest for status quo to remain and for the child to continue staying under her care in Singapore.[^36]

23     The Wife took the position that the child has a stable life in Singapore and has established a daily routine, as such, relocation to India would uproot the child and disrupt the stability that the child currently enjoys. The Wife further mentioned that she has an Employment Pass in Singapore and has the intention to reside in Singapore in the long term. Her family members who are her support system are also permanent residents of Singapore.

24     The Wife further highlighted that should the child relocate to India, the child would lose the relationship with her as the Wife will have to stay in Singapore given her current condition and the fact that she has no job and no support in India.[^37] Conversely, should the child remain in Singapore, the child would still be able to bond with the Husband.[^38]

25     The Wife’s counsel also provided several cases and some of them did not support joint care or overnight access for young children and submitted that the court should be slow to do so[^39].

## Decision and reasons

26     It was clear to me that both sides cared deeply for their child and they were able to communicate reasonably well from the evidence shown. I noted that the Wife was only willing to communicate with the Husband in writing. How-ever there were no evidence adduced to show that the Husband was unreasonable or acrimonious in the present communications between parties. While there were disagreements over the extent of care provided by both sides, both sides and their families participated to care for the child before the Wife relocated with the child to Singapore. After the move to Singapore, the Wife’s family was naturally more involved. It was only a short while later that the Husband followed fast behind for the child. Soon the Wife and her family imposed restrictions and refused to give overnight access to the Husband. The specific reasons were never clearly articulated. While these happened during the COVID pandemic, I find that the Wife and her family had imposed such restrictions against the Husband in a rather high-handed manner. The Husband had not behaved unreasonably in wanting to see or try out weekly overnight access to his child after some months in Singapore. Even if there were great displeasures against the Husband for the breakdown of the marriage, the Husband was still the father of the child. Un-fortunately the protective measures adopted by the Wife’s family resulted in these court proceedings and deeper acrimony.

27     The Wife’s conduct in reneging on the Consent Terms and the effect of such an action was another point of contention between parties. I was not in a position to confirm if the Wife would be legally entitled to bring the Child over to Singapore permanently, without the Consent Terms. In my view, it was likely that the earlier agreement made it easier and faster for the Wife to bring the child out of India to Singapore. Hence naturally the Husband would feel aggrieved by the Wife’s subsequent conduct of changing her mind and restricting his access to his child. Be that as it may, I was persuaded that it would be in the child’s best interest to let the child stay on in Singapore. The child is only 3 years old, a young toddler. She is familiar, close to and comfortable with her caregivers, environment and routine in Singapore by now. On the other hand, the Husband has made efforts to start his business, obtain residency close to the child and stay on in Singapore, all for the child.

28     The cases cited by DC were relevant and I agree that we should be conservative for children of young ages. However, the present facts were unique with the child being cared for by both sides before their separation and the Husband reflecting a deep and sincere desire to care for the child. More-ever parties are still young and well-educated. They each have their other commitments to fulfil other than parenting duties. For example, the Husband must have a busy career and the Wife also works and is still recuperating. Both sides would continue to need help and support to care for the child. With a reasonable transition arrangement and cooperation from both sides, the child can benefit from their joint care and develop a close bond with both parents and their families. If parties had followed the terms of the consent order, it would more or less lead to a joint care arrangement. In conclusion, joint care was in the child’s best interest and a fair outcome for both sides. Hence I encouraged both sides to put their unhappy past behind and co-parent effectively for the child’s sake. I also removed the interim travel restrictions on the child from June 2021 onwards. Hopefully, parties would be less acrimonious and the child can travel with either side if air travel is permitted by then. I also allowed both sides to take turns to keep the child’s passport.

29     As both sides did not get what they asked for squarely, I did not order costs against either side.
