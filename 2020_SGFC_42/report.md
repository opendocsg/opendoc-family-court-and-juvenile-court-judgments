Family Law – Variation of ancillary matters – section 112(4) of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353)

22 April 2020

### District Judge Cheryl Koh:

## A.    Introduction

1       Summons No. 3278 of 2019 is the defendant ex-wife (the “**former Wife**”)’s application to vary the ancillary matters order dated 6 July 2018. She sought for, _inter alia_, the plaintiff ex-husband (the “**former Husband**”) to pay the outstanding 2nd instalment of $500,000.00 of the settlement sum of $2,000,000.00 (the “**Settlement Sum**”) to her within 14 days. _Alternatively_, she sought to have sole conduct of the sale of either or both of parties’ immovable properties at Emerald Hill (the “**Emerald Hill Property**”) and Marina Bay Suites (the “**MBS Property**”) (collectively, the “**Properties**”) towards satisfaction of the Settlement Sum.

2       Summons No. 3611 of 2019 is the former Husband’s application to vary the ancillary matters order dated 6 July 2018. He sought for, _inter alia_, parties to share in the net sale proceeds of the Properties in the ratio of 68:32 in favour of the former Husband, instead of paying the Settlement Sum to the former Wife. The former Wife disagreed.

3       On 8 January 2020, I ordered for the Order to be varied to provide for either or both of the Properties to be sold to effect payment of the Settlement Sum to the former Wife. On 22 January 2020, full orders as set out in \[46\] herein were extracted.

4       The former Husband has appealed against the whole of my decision. There is no appeal by the former Wife.

## B.    Background facts

5       Parties were married on 20 December 1991 and Interim Judgment was granted on 2 November 2017. Final Judgment was granted on 19 July 2018. This was hence about a 26 year marriage. There are two adult children of the marriage. The ancillary matters were fully resolved by way of two private mediation sessions, which took place before a lawyer, Mr. Raymond Yeo, on 18 May 2018 and 28 June 2018. Parties were represented by the same set of solicitors at the mediation as they are now in these applications. The first session led to the recording of a first consent order dated 18 May 2018 (“**First Order**”) in relation to the sale of both Properties. The second session on 28 June 2018 led to the recording of a settlement agreement (the “**Settlement Agreement**”) and the filing of an order of court in terms of the Settlement Agreement on 6 July 2018 (the “**Second Order**”) relating to all ancillary matters.

6       The former Husband is a businessman who had been during the marriage (and still is) self-employed in a company effectively owned by him known as XXX (the “**Company**”), carrying out trading activities. He currently draws a gross monthly salary of $43,000.00 from the Company. The former Wife became a homemaker during the marriage, although she was then also named as a director of the Company.

7       The First Order provided that pending the full settlement or adjudication of all ancillary matters and without prejudice to the same, the Emerald Hill Property shall be sold at a minimum reserve price of $6,300,000.00, failing which after six months it shall be sold at a minimum price of $6,000,000.00. Parties may mutually agree to vary the minimum reserve price in writing. The net sale proceeds, after payment of outstanding housing loan, refund to parties’ CPF and payment of costs and expenses of sale, shall be divided equally between parties. Parties are to bear the outgoings of the Emerald Hill Property equally pending the sale. As for the MBS Property, it shall be sold at a minimum reserve price of $4,000,000.00 after marketing for a year. In the event that it cannot be sold at the price of $4,000,000.00 after a year, parties shall agree to revise the minimum reserve price to the last transacted price of a similar unit. The net sale proceeds, after payment of outstanding housing loan, refund to parties’ CPF and payment of costs and expenses of the sale, are also to be divided equally between parties. The full terms of the First Order are set out in **Annex A** hereto at pages \[24\] to \[26\].

8       The Second Order essentially provided for the former Husband to pay the former Wife the Settlement Sum of $2,000,000.00 in four (4) equal instalments of $500,000.00 every six months after the Final Judgment, subject to certain deductions. This was in full and final settlement of the division of matrimonial assets and the former Wife’s claim for maintenance. In the event any of the instalments are not paid, the former Wife shall be entitled to receive the outstanding amounts by way of a transfer from the former Husband’s CPF Ordinary Account to her CPF ordinary account. The Second Order further contemplated what would happen in the event that either or both of the Properties were sold _before_ or _after_ the former Wife received the full Settlement Sum:

> (a)     in the event the Emerald Hill Property is sold _before_ the former Wife received the full Settlement Sum, she would receive an equal share of the net sale proceeds (after deducting housing loan and costs and expenses of sale) towards satisfaction of the Settlement Sum, if her equal share is less than the outstanding Settlement Sum. If her equal share is more than the outstanding Settlement Sum, the excess of her share would be paid to the former Husband so that the net result would be that she would receive only the total amount of the Settlement Sum;

> (b)     any refund to the former Wife’s CPF account from the sale of either or both Properties _before_ she received the full Settlement Sum would be considered as payment towards the Settlement Sum; and

> (c)     in the event that either or both Properties were sold _after_ the former Wife had received the full Settlement Sum, she would not be entitled to any sale proceeds including any refund to her CPF account. She would have to transfer any refunds made to her CPF account from the sale to the former Husband’s CPF account.

> The relevant terms of the Second Order are set out in **Annex A** hereto at pages \[27\] to \[28\].

9       Pursuant to the Second Order, the former Husband was to pay the former Wife the 1st instalment of $500,000.00 by 19 January 2019, less $6,500.00 (being the former Wife’s share of mediation costs) and $12,600.00 (being the monthly maintenance paid earlier to the former Wife). Instead, he only paid her $30,000.00 on 25 January 2019 and $426,851.89 on 2 February 2019, totalling $456,851.89. The former Husband deducted the sum of $11,294.12 for the outgoings of the MBS Property and the cost of a Chanel bag from the 1st instalment, which the Wife disagreed with.

10     Further, pursuant to the Second Order, the former Husband was to pay the former Wife the 2nd instalment of $500,000.00 by 19 July 2019. However, the former Husband has yet to pay any sums under the 2nd instalment.

11     On 24 September 2019, the former Wife filed Summons No. 3278 of 2019 seeking for _inter alia_, a declaration that the sum of $11,294.12 had been wrongfully deducted from the 1st instalment. Further, she sought for the 2nd instalment of $500,000.00 to be paid to her within 14 days. _Alternatively_, she sought for the Emerald Hill Property to be sold to satisfy payment of the Settlement Sum to her and if the proceeds from the Emerald Hill Property were insufficient to satisfy the full Settlement Sum, then the MBS Property would also be sold towards satisfaction of the Settlement Sum. The full prayers sought by her are set out in **Annex A** at pages \[29\] to \[31\].

12     On 17 October 2019, the former Husband filed Summons No. 3611 of 2019 seeking for, _inter alia_, both Properties to be sold and for parties to share in the net sale proceeds in the ratio of 68:32, in favour of the former Husband. The full prayers sought by him are set out in **Annex A** at pages \[32\] to \[33\]. The former Husband argued that he was unable to raise the Settlement Sum due to the following changes in circumstances:

> (a)     the cooling measures introduced by the government on 5 July 2018 which resulted in him being unable to sell either or both of the Properties;

> (b)     the decline in his ability to borrow funds from the bank, as he has made further borrowings from the banks in order to make payments to the former Wife and their elder daughter pursuant to the Second Order, and he could not make any further borrowings for further payments; and

> (c)     decline in the profitability of the Company’s business, due to an increase in prices by the Company’s suppliers and the US-Sino trade wars.

13     The former Wife disagreed that these were changes in circumstances, arguing that:

> (a)     the payment of the Settlement Sum was not expressed to be conditional upon the sale of either or both Properties; in fact, it was explicitly made independent of any such sale. It was not clear whether any proper marketing of the Properties were carried out for periods of time, and the former Husband appeared to only be willing to sell the Properties at a price of his own choosing; and

> (b)     the former Husband had effective control of the Company and was fully aware of the avenues he had available to him to pay the former Wife the Settlement Sum when he agreed to the Settlement Agreement. The profits of the Company varied over the years, and the former Husband continued to live an extravagant and luxurious lifestyle.

14     At the hearing, both counsel accepted that either or both Properties were to be sold, before the former Husband would make any further payments to the former Wife. As at the date of my decision (22 January 2020), the 3rd instalment of $500,000.00 would have already become due (on 19 January 2020) but remained unpaid.

15     The affidavits and submissions filed by parties are as follows:

> (a)     the former Wife’s 1st affidavit filed on 24 September 2019;

> (b)     the former Husband’s 1st affidavit (and their daughter’s affidavit) filed on 17 October 2019;

> (c)     the former Wife’s 2nd affidavit filed on 7 November 2019;

> (d)     the former Husband’s 2nd affidavit filed on 3 December 2019;

> (e)     the former Wife’s Submissions filed on 11 December 2019;

> (f)     the former Husband’s Submissions filed on 11 December 2019; and

> (g)     the former Wife’s solicitor’s affidavit filed on 23 December 2019.

## C.    Grounds of Decision

### The law

16     Section 112(4) of the Women’s Charter allows the Court to vary an order for the division of matrimonial assets:

> “_The court may, at any time it thinks fit, extend, vary, revoke or discharge any order made under this section, and may vary any term or condition upon or subject to which any such order has been made_.”

17     In _TYA v TYB_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHCF 29</span> (“**_TYA v TYB_**”)[^1], the High Court summarized the legal principles in relation to this provision as follows:

> _“20_      _I begin with a summary of the established principles on the variation of an order for the division of matrimonial assets under s 112(4) of the Charter. That provision says that “\[t\]he court may, at any time it thinks fit, extend, vary, revoke or discharge any order made under this section, and may vary any term or condition upon or subject to which any such order has been made”. The court exercises its discretion under this broadly-worded provision in accordance with the following principles:_

>> (_a_)     _Once an order of court has been fully implemented, the court generally does not have power to revisit or re-open the order, save where there is fraud: see AYM at \[22\] and \[30\]; see also BMI v BMJ and another matter <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 63</span> at \[9\]._

>> (_b_)     _The court will vary an order for the division of matrimonial assets where the order is unworkable ab initio or has become unworkable as a result of new circumstances: AYM at \[23\]._

>> (_c_)     _An order might be unworkable ab initio due to a lack of functionality of the order, or as a result of a fundamental misunderstanding at the time the order was made: AYM at \[29\]._

>> (_d_)     _An order might become unworkable in the literal sense or purposive sense as a result of new circumstances which arise. It becomes unworkable in the literal sense when it becomes practically impossible to implement._ **_It becomes unworkable in the purposive sense when new circumstances emerge which so radically change the situation that to implement the order would be to implement something radically different from what was originally intended:_** _AYM at \[25\]; Seah Kim Seng v Yick Sui Ping <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 731</span> (“Seah Kim Seng”) at \[26\]._

>> (_e_)     _Where an order is unworkable ab initio or has become unworkable as a result of new circumstances, the court may vary the order as far as necessary and in a practical way: AYM at \[23\] and \[25\]; Seah Kim Seng at \[48\]” (emphasis added)._

18     The Singapore Court of Appeal emphasized in _AYM v AYL_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 1 SLR 924</span>[^2]_(“_**_AYM v AYL_**”) at \[23\] the fundamental importance of finality in the context of matrimonial assets even if the division has not been completely effected or implemented:

> _“assuming that the order for the division of matrimonial assets made by the court has not been completely effected or implemented, there still remains the issue as to the grounds on which the court would vary an order already made._ **_In our view, the fundamental importance of finality in the context of the division of matrimonial assets would also apply here. To this end, we are of the view that the court would make, inter alia, the necessary variations to an order for the division of matrimonial assets only where the order was unworkable or has become unworkable_** _(but before it has been fully effected or implemented). We would however, point out, parenthetically, that the courts would not look favourably upon frivolous applications that would constitute an abuse of the process of court, which applications would be subject, inter alia, to the appropriate costs orders”_ (emphasis added).

19     In _AYM v AYL_, the Court of Appeal also held at \[33\] that the husband’s business failure and loss of income did not amount to a change in circumstances sufficient to justify a variation of the division of matrimonial assets:

> _“It is clear, in our view, that the change in circumstances which the Husband prayed in aid fell far short of the radical change in circumstances referred to above (at \[25\]) and did not amount to the order becoming unworkable._ **_Even if business failure and a loss of income amounted to a “material change in the circumstances” sufficient to justify a variation of an order for maintenance, they did not suffice in the present case to justify the invocation of s 112(4) in so far as the division of matrimonial assets was concerned. It should also be noted that the order concerned was the result of a consent order between the Husband and the Wife_** _(and see generally above at \[15\]). Indeed, the Husband was, in the final analysis, merely attempting to obtain a further amount because the matrimonial asset concerned was now worth more than what the parties had originally thought (see above at \[3\])._ **_Such attempts to undermine the finality of orders with regard to the division of matrimonial assets are wholly undesirable as well as unmeritorious and are, indeed, the very antithesis of the rationale underlying such orders in the first place, and aptly demonstrate the dangers of a wide interpretation of s 112(4)”_** (emphasis added).

20     In _TYA v TYB_, the High Court further held at \[46\] that if an order for division of matrimonial assets is to be varied, the variation ought to be only to the extent necessary to give effect to the objective of the order:

> _“_ **_When an order for the division of matrimonial assets is eligible to be varied under s 112(4) of the Charter, the court ought to vary the order only to the extent necessary to give effect to the objective of the order_** _. The starting point for discerning that objective is the text of the original order. Where the order is a consent order, the text will be of particular importance because it will be presumed to reflect the parties’ intentions at the time they consented to the order. The variation will accordingly be an exercise in discerning those intentions, having regard to the circumstances in which they were formed, and subsequently giving effect to them in the best possible way. The court should also bear in mind the specific reason or reasons for which the order in question has been found to be unworkable. The variation which is effected by the court must have a rational connection to the unworkability that has been identified. This is an important principle for the mere fact of unworkability does not grant the court a carte blanche discretion to rewrite an order on the division of the parties’ matrimonial assets. That would undermine the policy of finality behind s 112 of the Charter._ **_Instead, the variation must address the unworkability which has arisen. It must represent a solution which goes no further than circumventing the unworkability identified and advancing the objective of the order_** _” (emphasis added)._

21     I would add that for a change in circumstance which has emerged to radically change the situation such that implementing the original consent order would be to implement something radically different from what parties had intended, such a change must be one that is beyond parties’ reasonable contemplation or reasonable expectations at the time of the consent order. If, at the time of the consent order, parties reasonably could have envisaged the likelihood or possibility of a new circumstance emerging, which would impact the underlying basis of the consent order, but nonetheless proceeded to enter into the consent order without addressing or taking into account such a change, then parties must be upheld to their financial bargain and cannot rely on the new change to unravel the consent order. For instance, in the present case, are cooling measures introduced by the Singapore government something so unexpected or untoward beyond parties’ reasonable contemplation at the time, such that it should now justify a variation of the Second Order? In my view, as will be discussed below, the answer is in the negative.

22     The issues which thus arise for consideration in the instant case are: (a) whether the Second Order has become unworkable in the purposive sense due to changes in circumstances beyond parties’ reasonable contemplation at the time; and (b) if so, what is the variation necessary to address the unworkability and give effect to the objective of the Second Order? In my judgment, I did not see any changes in circumstances sufficient to justify a variation of the Second Order insofar as the financial bargain for the former Wife to receive the Settlement Sum of $2 million is concerned. However, given that the former Wife is prepared to accept that she would receive payment of the Settlement Sum from the sale proceeds of either or both of the Properties, I made a variation of the Second Order only to the extent necessary to achieve this objective.

## 1st issue: Whether there has been changes in circumstances which render the Second Order unworkable

### Allegation that the cooling measures has resulted in a drop in the property market

23      _First_, I was unable to accept that the cooling measures introduced by the Singapore government in July 2018 has resulted in such a significant drop in prices of the Properties beyond parties’ reasonable expectations, so as to render the Second Order unworkable.

24     The Husband argued that at the time of the Settlement Agreement, he had taken the value of the Emerald Hill Property as $6,528,000.00 and the value of the MBS Property as $3,346,595.65, as reflected in his solicitors’ mediation statement dated 4 May 2018 tendered for the first mediation session on 10 May 2018. However, on 5 July 2018, the Singapore government announced cooling measures on the property market by introducing, _inter alia_, higher additional buyer’s stamp duty rates and adjusting loan-to-value limits downwards. Thus, the current market value has dropped to $4,262,648.00 for the Emerald Hill Property and to $3,029,000.00 for the MBS Property, based on the latest sale transactions[^3], and these Properties remained unsold.

25     In my view, it would have been (or ought to have been) within the former Husband’s reasonable contemplation that the Properties could be sold at a significantly lower value than what is asserted in his mediation statement, and he cannot now rely on the drop in the market as a change to vary the Second Order.

26     In his 1st Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 9 March 2018, the former Husband asserted that the Emerald Hill Property was valued at $4,950,000.00 (as opposed to the current alleged value of $4,262,648.00) and the MBS Property was valued at $3,050,000.00 (as opposed to the current alleged value of $3,029,000.00). These values reflected in his 1st Affidavit of Assets and Means are not far apart from the current alleged values of the Properties, and should have been contemplated by him as representing reasonable possibilities of these values; otherwise, he ought not to have asserted these figures in his affidavit. Having asserted these values as reasonable possibilities, it does not now lie in his mouth to claim, when these values have crystallized after the implementation of cooling measures, that these values were so low that he could not have imagined them as truly representing the values of these Properties at the time.

27     Further, the First Order also evidences that parties had contemplated the possibilities that the Properties could not be sold at their minimum reserve prices. For the Emerald Hill Property, the First Order provided that if parties could not sell it at the minimum reserve price, parties may mutually agree to vary the price. For the MBS Property, the First Order contemplated that if it could not be sold at the minimum reserve price, it would have to be sold at a price based on the “_last transacted price of a similar unit_”.

28     Additionally, cooling measures as introduced by the Singapore government for the property market are not something so untoward or so unexpected as beyond parties’ reasonable contemplation, such that these measures may be relied upon each time to alter the financial bargain reached on division of matrimonial assets and/or maintenance in divorce cases. Extending this argument to its fullest, it meant that all ancillary matters orders, which were made by the Family Justice Courts just before these cooling measures were introduced in July 2018, and which involve the sale of immovable properties, would have to be unravelled and revisited because these cooling measures have resulted in a drop in the property market. This cannot be the case. Judicial notice may also be taken of the fact that since 2009, the Singapore government has been introducing cooling measures frequently every other year or every few years, including in February 2018 just before the Settlement Agreement was reached in June 2018. After the cooling measures were announced on 5 July 2018, parties nonetheless proceeded to extract the Second Order on 6 July 2018.

29     Indeed, construing the intention of parties as evident in the wording of the Second Order, the payment of the Settlement Sum is not conditional upon the sale of either or both Properties, nor linked to any particular value of these Properties. The Second Order made no reference to any value of each of the Properties (in contrast to the First Order which referred to the minimum reserve sale price of both Properties). The Second Order contemplated full payment of the Settlement Sum to the former Wife even _before_ either or both of the Properties were sold, _i.e._, this meant that parties envisaged the possibility that neither of the Properties would be sold before payment of the Settlement Sum is made. That was why instalments of the Settlement Sum payable every 6 months were incorporated into the Settlement Agreement, even if the Properties were not sold. The sale of either or both Properties merely expedited the payment of the Settlement Sum. If the former Husband had not been confident of raising funds independent of the sale of the Properties, he could have worded the Settlement Agreement in the same manner as parties had just done in the First Order, where the Wife would only receive a certain percentage of the Properties when sold. If he had thought that he could pay the Settlement Sum over the course of two years because he would have sold the Properties by then, he could have also made payment conditional upon the sale of these Properties. This is especially given that he was legally represented at the mediation and would have been fully advised of the various possibilities of wording the Settlement Agreement. As such, that these Properties remained unsold should not constitute a change in circumstance which should alter the underlying financial bargain, when this is a circumstance which was expressly contemplated by parties as having no bearing on the payment of the Settlement Sum, other than to accelerate payment of the same.

30     I also accept that there were some doubts as to whether there has been proper marketing of the Properties between July 2018 to March 2019 resulting in them remaining unsold: in an email from the former Husband’s property agent dated 6 October 2019, the former Husband had set the asking price of the Emerald Hill Property at $6.5 million and the MBS Property at $3.8 million, despite his agent informing him that the last transaction price for the Emerald Hill Property and the MBS Property had been lower than his asking price by around $1.1 million and $800,000.00 respectively[^4]. This could have had an impact on prospective viewings of these Properties at the time.

31     For these reasons, I did not accept the cooling measures introduced in July 2018, and that the Properties have thereafter dropped in value and remained unsold, as sufficient reasons to vary the Second Order.

### Allegation that there has been a decline in the former Husband’s ability to raise funds through borrowings from the banks

32      _Second_, I was unable to find that a decline in the former Husband’s ability to make further borrowings from the banks constitutes a change in circumstance beyond his reasonable expectations, which justifies a variation of the Second Order.

33     The former Husband argued that subsequent to the Second Order, he had made payments totalling $681,851.89 to the former Wife and their elder daughter, which was raised from the Company’s borrowings from OCBC in 2018, and refinanced with UOB in 2019. Todate, the Company has borrowed $950,846.98 from UOB, some of which were for its business operations, and which represented 72% of the Company’s forced sale value. He tried to borrow further monies from UOB but UOB had declined[^5].

34     In my view, the payments totalling $681,851.89 made to the former Wife and their elder daughter were in fact expressly contemplated under the Second Order, and made pursuant to the terms of the Second Order, and cannot now be relied upon as an unexpected change in circumstance to unravel the financial bargain reached thereunder. The sum of $225,000.00 was paid to parties’ elder daughter in July 2018 for her to transfer 10% shareholding in the Company to him, pursuant to Clause 3(1) of the Second Order. The sum of $456,851.89 was paid to the former Wife in January and February 2019 as the 1st instalment of the Settlement Sum (from which she claimed he had wrongfully deducted the sum of $11,294.12). When agreeing to these terms under the Second Order, he would have addressed his mind as to how he would have raised these funds, and in particular for the 1st instalment, to raise the sum within six months of the Final Judgment. It must be borne in mind that at the time, the former Husband’s declared annual income alone was $595,584.00[^6], the matrimonial assets declared in his 1st Affidavit of Assets and Means were over $13 million, and the matrimonial assets declared in his mediation statement were over $6 million. He was (and still is) a man of financial resource, and would have known of the avenues available to him to raise funds. It appeared that these avenues would have included making borrowings from the banks, which he eventually did to pay $681,851.89 to the former Wife and their elder daughter by February 2019.

35     The same applies to the Settlement Sum in that the former Husband would have, or ought to have, worked out his sums before committing to all four payments of $500,000.00 each every six months, and made expressly independent of the sale of the Properties in the Second Order. In this regard, the former Wife’s evidence is that during the mediation, parties broke out in separate rooms for the former Husband to work out his sums to ensure that he would be able to comply with raising the funds for the Settlement Agreement. Parties also agreed that their eldest daughter would transfer her 10% shares in the Company for a sum of $225,000.00. This meant that he would be in effective control of all the shares in the Company and would have been fully aware of all the avenues available to him to raise the funds to pay the Settlement Sum[^7]. If he had thought that he could pay the Settlement Sum because he could raise funds by borrowing from the banks, he could have made payment conditional upon the release of borrowed funds from the banks, but he did not. As such, I do not see how he is now able to rely on supposed miscalculations in his ability to borrow funds to justify the unravelling of parties’ financial bargain.

### Allegation that there has been a decline in the profitability of the former Husband’s business

36      _Finally_, I was unable to find that the decline in the profitability of the former Husband’s business justified a variation of the Second Order.

37     The former Husband argued that due to the increase in prices by the Company’s suppliers leading to a loss of customers, as well as the US-Sino trade wars introducing uncertainty to the market, there has been a decline in the Company’s sales. Whilst the Company had been profitable over the past few years, it had made a net loss of $235,120.03 as of September 2019[^8].

38     In my judgment, the alleged decline in profitability of the former Husband’s business is an insufficient reason to unravel the Second Order. The payment of the Settlement Sum was not made conditional upon the profits of the Company, nor did it appear that there were any connection between the two: at the time of the Settlement Agreement, the Company’s profits for financial year 2017 was only $112,896.00. Clearly, the former Husband was not going to rely on the Company’s mere profit of a hundred thousand dollars to pay the Settlement Sum of $2 million, and must have thought of other means to do so. Even if the Company has now made a loss of $235,120.03, this is after taking into account the payment of $387,000.00 already made to the former Husband from January to September 2019 as director’s remuneration[^9]. This meant that the decline in profitability of the Company’s business has in fact no impact on his monthly income and standard of living, and he is still able to pay for all of his expenses, including financing the Properties. In this regard, the Wife’s evidence is that the profits of the Company varied over the years, and the former Husband still continued to lead a comfortable lifestyle where, other than drawing a monthly salary of $43,000.00 from the Company, he drives a Porsche and travelled on several holidays to Europe and elsewhere in 2018 and 2019[^10]. These are not denied by the former Husband.

39     It must be also borne in mind that business failure alone is not sufficient to justify a variation of the division of matrimonial assets, as stated by the Court of Appeal in _AYM v AYL_ at \[33\]:

> _\[e\]ven if business failure and a loss of income amounted to a “material change in the circumstances” sufficient to justify a variation of an order for maintenance, they did not suffice in the present case to justify the invocation of s 112(4) in so far as the division of matrimonial assets was concerned.”_

40     For these reasons, I did not see how the decline in the Company’s profitability is a sufficient reason to vary the Second Order.

## 2nd issue: what is the variation necessary to give effect to give effect to the objective of the Second Order?

### Whether the former Wife should receive 32% of the net sale proceeds of the Properties, or the Settlement Sum of $2 million

41     As stated above, I was unable to find any changes in circumstances, which were so unexpected or untoward as beyond parties’ reasonable expectations and which radically altered the situation, so as to be sufficient to justify a variation of the Second Order. The former Wife is however prepared to accept payment of the Settlement Sum from the sale proceeds of either or both of the Properties. This is because the Second Order provided that in the event of default of payment of an instalment, the former Husband would transfer payment from his CPF Ordinary account to her CPF Ordinary account; but he currently only had about $10,000.00 left in his Ordinary account; in this particular aspect, the Second Order is unworkable.

42     A sale of the Properties would result in net proceeds (after deducting housing loan and estimated costs and expense of sale) of at least $2.5 million for the Emerald Hill Property and over a $1million for the MBS Property[^11]. The Second Order is hence workable in the sense that the former Husband is able to raise funds from the sale of the Properties to pay the Settlement Sum. Thus, I made a variation to the Second Order to the extent necessary to allow either or both Properties to be sold and the sale proceeds to be applied towards satisfaction of the outstanding Settlement Sum. Such a variation would not alter the underlying financial bargain reached between parties, which is that the former Wife still received the full $2 million sum, nothing more or less.

43     The former Husband argued that with regard to the sale of the Properties, the former Wife should receive 32% of the net value of these Properties, instead of the Settlement Sum. This was because the $2 million Settlement Sum in fact represented 32% of the then total matrimonial asset value of $6,623,181.00, as stated in his mediation statement[^12].

44     I was however unable to accept this argument. The former Wife’s acceptance of a $2 million settlement did not mean that the former Wife accepted 32% of the then total matrimonial asset value. At the time of the Settlement Agreement, only the first round of parties’ Affidavits of Assets and Means had been exchanged, and no discovery or interrogatories had yet been undertaken. There is no evidence of any agreed values used by parties during the mediation; the former Wife’s mediation statement[^13] did not ascribe a value to the Properties or the matrimonial pool, but simply sought a 50% division of all matrimonial assets. The Wife’s evidence is that the Settlement Sum was a global settlement sum on the division of matrimonial assets and her maintenance, and took into account non-legal factors during negotiations, including her love and concern for the younger daughter (e,g., paragraph 1(11) of the Settlement Agreement sets aside a sum of $150,000.00 for her which she could use for her education)[^14]. It could not be looked upon as a calculation based on a percentage of the supposed value of matrimonial assets as if it were a full ancillary hearing. For this reason, and the reasons enunciated above that the financial bargain reached between parties should not be altered, I allowed a variation to the extent necessary for the former Wife to receive satisfaction of the outstanding Settlement Sum from the sale proceeds of either or both Properties.

## D.    Conclusion

45     As there is no appeal by the Wife, I will not deal with the other prayers in her Summons. As for the Husband’s Summons, I have wholly dismissed the same for the reasons discussed above.

46     In these circumstances, I made the following orders to reflect a variation of the Second Order:

> _“1_.     _Paragraphs 1(2), 1(4) to 1(10) of the Order of Court dated 6 July 2018 ("Consent Order") be varied as follows:-_

>> _Both the Emerald Hill property and the Marina Bay Suites property shall be sold in the open market within 6 months of the date of this Order of Court and all the sale proceeds, after repayment of outstanding mortgage loans, refund to parties' CPF of the amounts utilized for the purchase of these properties together with accrued interest, and costs and expenses of sale, shall be retained wholly by the Plaintiff._

>> _The Plaintiff shall pay the Defendant the sum of $2 million from the sale proceeds of these properties (inclusive of any amounts that is refunded to the Defendant's CPF account); in the event that one property is sold before the other, the Defendant shall receive such sum up to $2 million from the sale proceeds of the property that is sold earlier and any balance from the property that is sold subsequently._

>> _With regard to the detailed procedure for the sale of both properties:-_

>>> _a_.     _Either the Emerald Hill Property or Marina Bay Suites Property shall be sold first (1st Property) within 6 months of this Order in the open market and the gross sale proceeds shall be utilised to refund/pay the following sums in the stated order of priority:-_

>>>> _i_.     _repayment of the outstanding mortgage housing loan (including accrued interest);_

>>>> _ii_.     _an amount equivalent to the Defendant's CPF contributions (including accrued interest) towards the 1st Property, to be refunded to Defendant's CPF account, and an amount equivalent to the Plaintiff's CPF contributions (including accrued interest) towards the 1st Property, to be refunded to Plaintiff's CPF account;_

>>>> _iii_.     _repayment of all expenses of sale and agent's commission; and_

>>>> _iv_.     _repayment of the legal costs of $1,500 ordered in Paragraph 2 of this Order of Court;_

>>> _b_.     _After refund/repayment of the sums in paragraph 1(a) above, the balance of the gross sale proceeds of the 1st Property (hereinafter called the 1st Property Net Proceeds), if any, shall be paid to the Defendant in settlement of the unpaid portion of the Settlement Sum or in partial settlement in the event that the 1st Property Net Proceeds are insufficient to fully repay the unpaid portion of the Settlement Sum. For the avoidance of doubt, if the said remainder of the 1st Property Net Proceeds is insufficient to fully pay the Defendant the unpaid portion of the Settlement Sum, the Defendant shall receive the entire 1st Property Net Proceeds;_

>>> _c_.     _If after full payment to the Defendant of the hitherto unpaid portion of the Settlement Sum there is any balance of the 1st Property Net Proceeds still remaining, that balance shall be retained by the Plaintiff;_

>>> _d_.     _In the event that the 1st Property is successfully sold and completed as set out in paragraphs 1(a) to (b) above but the Settlement Sum in favour of the Defendant is not fully satisfied in any way, the remaining property not sold (2nd Property) shall be sold within 6 months from the date of this Order of Court at the then market value and the gross sale proceeds shall be utilised to refund/pay the following sums first:_

>>>> _i_.     _repayment of the outstanding mortgage housing loan (including accrued interest);_

>>>> _ii_.     _an amount equivalent to the Defendant's CPF contributions (including accrued interest) towards the 2nd Property, to be refunded to Defendant's CPF account, and an amount equivalent to the Plaintiff's CPF contributions (including accrued interest) towards the 2nd Property, to be refunded to Plaintiff's CPF account; and_

>>>> _iii_.     _repayment of all expenses of sale and agent's commission;_

>>> _e_.     _After refund/repayment of the sums in paragraph 1(d) above, the balance of the gross sale proceeds of the 2nd Property (hereinafter called the 2nd Property Net Proceeds) shall be utilized first to pay to the Defendant the unpaid portion of the Settlement Sum._

>>> _f_.     _If after full payment to the Defendant of the unpaid portion of the Settlement Sum there is any balance of the 2nd Property Net Proceeds still remaining, that balance shall be retained by the Plaintiff;_

>>> _g_.     _For the avoidance of doubt, the refund to the Defendant's CPF account of monies utilised by her (including accrued interest thereon) towards the purchase of the Emerald Hill Property and/or the Marina Bay Suites Property shall constitute part payment of the Settlement Sum;_

>>> _h_.     _In the event that the 2nd Property is successfully sold and completed as set out above in paragraphs 1(d) to (e), but the Settlement Sum in favour of the Defendant is not fully satisfied in any way, the outstanding portion of the Settlement Sum shall be a debt due to the Defendant and recoverable as such;_

>>> _i_.     _In the event that the 2nd Property is successfully sold and completed after the full payment of the Settlement Sum to the Defendant, the Defendant shall not be entitled to retain any portion of the sale proceeds of the 2nd Property including any refund of the Defendant's CPF monies utilised for the purchase of these properties;_

>>> _j_.     _Both parties shall vacate the said Emerald Hill Property and yield vacant possession of the said property at least 14 days prior to the completion of the sale._

**Order of Court dated 6 July 2018**

**1\. Division of matrimonial property**

> (1)     The following terms are in full and final settlement of the Defendant’s claim for maintenance as well as the division of all of the matrimonial assets, including the 2 immovable properties i.e. (a) XXX (the “**MBS Property**”) and (b) XXX (the “**Emerald Hill Property**”):
