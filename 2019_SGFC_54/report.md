Family Law – Maintenance – Enforcement – Section 71 Women’s Charter

13 May 2019

### District Judge Lo Wai Ping:

## Background

1       The parties were married in 2005. The husband (“**Husband**”) filed for divorce based on the fact that he and the wife (“**Wife**”) had lived apart for a continuous period of at least 4 years immediately prior to his filing of the writ for divorce. On **26 October 2016**, interim judgment for divorce (“**Interim Judgment**”) was granted and _consent orders_ for the ancillary matters were also recorded on the same date. These consent orders included a maintenance order (“**Maintenance Order**”) for the Wife and their child (the “**child**”) on the following terms:

> (a)     the Husband shall pay to the Wife **$2,000 per month as maintenance for the child** starting one month from the date of issuance of the certificate of final judgment and “until such time that the child is financially independent”;[^1] and

> (b)     the Husband shall pay **$1,000 per month as maintenance for the Wife** starting also one month from the date of issuance of the certificate of final judgment and this maintenance was to cease “in the event that the \[Wife\] remarries”.[^2]

2       In September 2018, the Wife commenced these proceedings in MSS 3239/2018 (“**Current Application**”) against the Husband under section 71 of the Women’s Charter Cap 353 (“**Section 71**”) for his failure to comply with the Maintenance Order. This was the _second_ time she had applied to court to enforce the Maintenance Order.

#### First Application – Consent EMO dated 12 March 2018

3       In 2017, the Wife had filed an earlier enforcement application in MSS 802110/2017 (“**First Application**”) against the Husband under Section 71 to enforce the same Maintenance Order.

4       Pursuant to the First Application, and by consent of the parties, an order was granted on 12 March 2018 (“**Consent EMO**”). At the time, the maintenance owing by the Husband under the Maintenance Order was $15,000.

5       Under the terms of the Consent EMO, the Husband was to pay the Wife the agreed arrears of $15,000 in instalments of $500 per month on or before the 1st day of each month with effect from 1 April 2018. The monthly instalments were to be paid into the Wife’s POSB account XX.

6       The Consent EMO also made clear, the following:[^3]

> (a)     that upon the Husband’s failure to pay any of the monthly instalments in accordance with the instalment plan mentioned above (see **paragraph 5**), the full amount owing would become immediately due and enforceable; and

> (b)     that the maintenance payable by the Husband under the existing Maintenance Order remained payable.

7       The Husband made the monthly instalment payments of $500 in compliance with the instalment plan set out in the Consent EMO. However, he continued to fail to pay the monthly maintenance for the Wife and the child in accordance with the Maintenance Order.

8       The Husband did not dispute that under the Maintenance Order, he was to pay the Wife a total sum of $3,000 per month as maintenance for the Wife and child and that the monthly maintenance was to be paid on the first day of each month.

#### Husband’s application to vary the Maintenance Order – Dismissed in August 2018

9       After the Consent EMO, the Husband applied to vary (reduce) the maintenance amounts set out in the Maintenance Order. However, his application was unsuccessful. The Husband testified that his variation application was dismissed in October 2018, but court records showed that his variation application was dismissed in August 2018 before the filing of the Current Application on 3 September 2018 to enforce the Maintenance Order.

## Current Application – filed on 3 September 2018

10     I heard the Current Application in January 2019. The Wife’s case was that a total sum of $38,500 was owing by the Husband under the Maintenance Order by that time. This sum was inclusive of the arrears remaining unpaid under the Consent EMO. She asked for the Husband to pay up the full amount of the arrears in monthly instalments of $3,500. She also applied for an attachment of earnings order for these monthly payments.

11     The Husband did not dispute the outstanding amount of arrears as claimed by the Wife. The Husband’s case was that he was financially strapped and unable to pay the arrears in a lump sum. He requested for the following:

> (a)     that he be allowed to continue with the payment of the monthly instalments of $500 towards the arrears set out in the Consent EMO, and

> (b)     that he be allowed to pay up the rest of the maintenance arrears in monthly instalments of $200.

## Orders made on 24 January 2019

#### (A)   Arrears of $10,000 left unpaid under the Consent EMO

12     I dealt with the arrears that were owed under the Consent EMO first.

13     The Wife agreed that the Husband had been complying with the Consent EMO in paying up the monthly instalments of $500 towards the agreed arrears of $15,000. She confirmed that there was only a balance sum of $10,000 remaining unpaid as of 24 January 2019.

14     Given that the Husband had been complying with the Consent EMO in respect of the arrears set out therein and having regard to its terms, I granted the Husband’s first request and made it clear in my decision on 24 January 2019 that the Husband was to _continue to comply with the instalment plan ordered under the Consent EMO until he completed the payment of the balance arrears._

#### (B)   Arrears of $28,500 under the Maintenance Order (for the period from April 2018 to January 2019)

15     In respect of the rest of the arrears amounting to $28,500 claimed by the Wife, she confirmed that this was maintenance that the Husband had not paid to her under the Maintenance Order for the period from April 2018 to January 2019. As mentioned earlier, the Husband did not dispute this amount claimed by the Wife but had requested that he be allowed to pay up this amount in instalments of $200 per month.

16     At the end, having heard the parties and based on the evidence adduced before the Court, I made the following orders on 24 January 2019. I ordered the Husband to pay the Wife the agreed arrears of $28,500 in instalments as follows:

> (a)     $3,500 on or before the 1 March 2019; and

> (b)     the remaining $25,000 in ten (10) monthly instalments of $2,500 on or before 1st day of each month with effect from 1 April 2019.

It was also similarly stated in my orders that upon the Husband’s failure to pay any of the instalments in accordance with the abovementioned instalment plan, the full amount owing would become immediately due and enforceable.

17     Just so that there would not be any doubt over the matter, I also made it clear to the Husband on 24 January 2019 that unless the Maintenance Order was varied or discharged, he had to continue to pay the monthly maintenance for the Wife and child in accordance with its terms.

## The Husband’s appeal

18     The Husband has appealed only against my orders set out in **paragraph 16** above as regards the eleven (11) instalments to be paid by him towards the arrears of $28,500 (owed for the period from April 2018 to January 2019).

19     I set out below my grounds of decision for these orders.

## Grounds of Decision

20     The Wife had filed the Current Application to enforce the Maintenance only after the Husband’s application to reduce the maintenance amounts in the Maintenance Order had been heard and dismissed in August 2018.

21     When I heard the Current Application on 23 January 2019, the Husband had not filed any appeal against the dismissal of his variation application. He had also not made any further application to vary the Maintenance Order.

22     This was also the second time enforcement action had been taken against the Husband for not complying with his maintenance obligations under the Maintenance Order. The Consent EMO in the First Application had only been granted in March 2018.

23     The Husband had no reason not to be ready and prepared for the hearing on 23 January 2019. I say this for the following reasons. First, he was a well-educated person; a banker by occupation. Second, court records showed that on 2 November 2018, he had requested and was given time by the Mention Court to seek legal advice and to prepare his bundle of documents for the purposes of the hearing. Parties then filed and exchanged their respective bundles of documents on 16 November 2018 and thereafter, the case was scheduled for hearing on 23 January 2019. There was therefore a further period of about 2 months (after his documents were filed on 16 November 2018) for the Husband to prepare his case for the hearing.

24     In fact, altogether, the Husband had about _4 months_ to prepare for his case as court records showed that he was first notified of the Wife’s Current Application on 8 September 2018 when he was personally served with the summons to attend court.

25     I turn now to the evidence adduced by the Husband in support of his case.

26     He was currently working in the Singapore branch of a world-wide financial institution (“**Employer**”) as vice-president of a division. It should be noted that he chose not to disclose his employment contract, but had exhibited instead the following documents as evidence of his current employment and income:

> (a)     a letter dated 6 November 2018 from the Employer to a bank (DBS) certifying that the Husband had been employed by the Employer since 1 January 2018 and that the Husband had a _current annual base salary_ of $170,000; and

> (b)     salary slips (for 6 months from May to October 2018) showing that he was paid a _basic salary_ of $14,166.67 per month and received a net pay of $12,966.67 per month.

He also provided copies of documents relating to his Notices of Assessment for years of assessment 2015, 2016 and 2017. However, he did not provide his Notice of Assessment for year of assessment 2018, which would be for his income for 2017.

27     The Employer’s letter dated 6 November 2018 to DBS showed that the Husband’s _total employment income_ would likely be _more than $170,000_ for the year of 2018 as this sum was stated by the Employer to be only his ‘_base annual salary_’. As such, whilst his salary slips showed he received a net pay of about $12,966 per month based on his base annual salary of $170,000 (see **paragraph 26 (b)** above), this sum was reflective only of the _minimum_ net amount per month he took home during those months.

28     Next, I examined the Husband’s case that he had no savings but only a car, an Audi SLJ XXXX (“**2016 AUDI**”) registered in December 2016, which was purchased by him at a price of $100,000[^4] around November 2018 under hire-purchase, and that his current monthly expenses of about $13,137 per month (without factoring in the maintenance sums (of $3,500) he had to pay every month under the Maintenance Order and Consent EMO) was more than his monthly take-home pay. See Table A below for the Husband’s list of expenses.

29     Apart from his income tax payments, it would appear that the Husband had to incur expenses totaling **$8,265 per month** for the premia payable for the insurance policies taken up by him, the 2016 AUDI and the medical expenses incurred by his new wife’s father (“**FIL**”). The Husband had remarried on 22 October 2018 according to the marriage certificate tendered at the hearing.

30     According to the Husband, FIL (a taxi driver) had emptied out his savings and extended the Husband a personal loan of $100,000 to pay off his debts and then, later, FIL was diagnosed with terminal stage cancer.[^6] Although the Husband’s agreement with FIL was that the Husband could pay back this loan slowly, as and when the Husband could[^7], the Husband had decided to repay FIL in the following manner because it was not certain how long FIL could live: -

> (a)     FIL’s Medical Expenses.

> He claimed that he was paying FIL’s medical expenses of $3,000 per month. This, the Husband explained, was because FIL did not have personal insurance and had depleted his Medisave after his initial hospitalisation.

> (b)     Car loan and car-related expenses

> He claimed that the 2016 AUDI was FIL’s car and that FIL had only bought the car a year ago at $120,000. He claimed that FIL wanted to sell it off to pay for his medical expenses but was hesitant to do so “at such a big loss” (as the car could only be currently sold off at $85,000). He explained that the car was not a necessity for him, but he bought it over to assist FIL and he was treating his purchase of the FIL’s car in early November 2018 as part of his repayment of the personal loan from FIL.[^8] As such, he was currently paying a sum of $2,265 per month for the car (about $2,107 per month for the car loan (over 36 instalments) and $158 per month for the motor insurance and road tax).

31     Although the Husband was given sufficient time to seek legal advice and prepare for the hearing, he did not adduce any evidence at the hearing on 23 January 2019 to corroborate his claim that FIL had lent him $100,000 to clear up all his personal debts. There were no documents provided to show the date and manner in which this alleged loan was extended by FIL to him to discharge his debts.

32     The Husband and his new wife were both bankers. It was difficult to accept the Husband’s evidence that he could not produce any supporting evidence of this alleged loan of $100,000 from FIL to him.

33     Further, it should be noted that when the Husband signed the form for his list of expenses, assets and income on 16 November 2018 and declared that the information set out therein was true and accurate [^9] and submitted the same to the Court on 16 November 2018, he declared that he had only a car loan (for the 2016 AUDI) with an outstanding balance of $67,893.

34     In the same form, he also declared that he had only 2 bank accounts (OCBC and Citibank) apart from the car as assets. He had submitted his bank statements for his OCBC account (from June 2018 to October 2018) and for his Citibank account (from May 2018 to October 2018). These bank statements showed that the Husband had credit cards. But, the Husband did not tender any statements relating to his credit card accounts and he also did not refer to any of the submitted bank statements to show deposits of monies into either of his accounts from FIL amounting to $100,000.

35     The Husband also claimed that he did not know that he could call FIL or other witnesses to testify at the hearing. This was despite having sought time earlier specifically to seek legal advice and having had more than 4 months to prepare for the hearing.

36     As mentioned earlier, the Husband only asserted that FIL extended the $100,000 loan to him before he was diagnosed with terminal stage cancer and that the loan was interest free with no definite date for repayment. However, a medical memo dated 29 October 2018 from the National University Hospital (“**NUH medical memo**”) showed that FIL had already been diagnosed with _advanced stage lung cancer_ by _July 2017_ and the Husband had married FIL’s daughter on 22 October 2018.

37     All considered, I was therefore not prepared on a balance of probabilities to accept the Husband’s bare assertion that FIL had lent him $100,000 to discharge his debts.

38     Next, I considered the Husband’s claim that he was paying FIL’s medical expenses of $3,000 per month.

39     Although there was a NUH medical memo to confirm FIL’s medical condition (that he had been found with advanced stage lung cancer in July 2017 and had been receiving treatment for it since August 2017), there was no evidence before me about FIL’s financial circumstances and FIL’s inability to pay for his medical expenses save for the Husband’s bare assertions that FIL had ‘emptied out’ all his savings to assist the Husband and that FIL had also depleted his Medisave and had no insurance.

40     The mere showing of FIL’s hospital invoices _per se_ did not prove that the Husband was the one paying for FIL’s medical expenses. The Husband did not show any documentary evidence at the hearing to prove that he had been the one paying for FIL’s medical expenses.

41     Further, the invoices that were tendered also did not show that FIL’s medical expenses amounted to $3,000 every month. I also noted the Husband’s evidence that his current wife was the youngest child in her family and that she had 2 older siblings who were all gainfully employed. In fact, her older brother was still living at home with FIL, his father. It should be noted that it was not the Husband’s case that FIL’s children could not assist with their father’s medical expenses.

42     Therefore, all considered, I did not accept, on a balance of probabilities, the Husband’s evidence that he paid or was paying recurring monthly medical expenses of $3,000 per month for FIL.

43     Next, I considered the hefty monthly expenses of $2,265 that the Husband was incurring for the 2016 AUDI since November 2018. According to him, this car had been purchased by FIL at $120,000 only ‘a year ago’, but again, no supporting documents were adduced to prove FIL’s purchase of the car.

44     Assuming we take the Husband’s evidence given at the hearing in January 2019 to be true, it would mean that FIL had bought the 2016 AUDI sometime in or about January 2018 or perhaps late 2017. However, FIL had found out by July 2017 that he had advanced stage lung cancer and had started cancer treatment by August 2017. It was difficult to believe the Husband’s evidence that FIL, a taxi driver, in that medical condition, would incur a substantial amount of money of about $120,000 to purchase the 2016 AUDI.

45     During cross-examination, the Husband said that FIL had wanted to sell the car even at a loss to pay for his medical bills and that was when he offered to help FIL “in lieu of repaying him in cash” (for FIL’s personal loan) by taking over his car.[^10] But, this took place only in November 2018 as can be seen from the documents tendered by the Husband as set out in the following paragraph.

46     The Husband had tendered the following documents (“**Car Documents**”) to show his monthly expenses for the car:

> (a)     An invoice from Cargent Pte Ltd dated 5 November 2018 addressed to the Husband showing that a sum of $2,907 had been paid to Cargent Pte Ltd. The invoice had the following details (reproduced):

> (c)     A Debit Note/Tax invoice dated 12 November 2018 from NTUC Income Insurance Co-operative Limited (“**NTUC**”) to the Husband stating that his insurance premium payable for the 2016 AUDI for the period of 1 year (from 15 November 2018 to 14 November 2019) was $1,898.18.

> (d)     The schedule of the NTUC private car insurance policy stating that the primary driver for the 2016 AUDI was the Husband. There was no other named driver in the schedule. The hire purchase company was stated as TCL and the policy was stated to have been issued on 12 November 2018.

47     It would appear from the first document (the invoice from Cargent Pte Ltd dated 5 November 2018) that the Husband had made the advance payment of the first instalment of $2,107 for the purchase of the 2016 AUDI on 5 November 2018 before the approval advice dated 9 November 2018 from TCL had even been issued approving the Husband’s application for hire -purchase.

48     It was also pertinent to note that there was a down payment of $30,000 for the purchase of the 2016 AUDI. Presumably, this would have been paid for by the Husband, based on his evidence on the circumstances leading to him making the purchase.

49     All the Car Documents taken together therefore showed that the Husband had taken on certain liabilities for the 2016 AUDI from _5 November 2018 onwards._ The insurance for the car was paid on 12 November 2018 for the 1- year period as stated in the invoice from NTUC. It should be noted that all these happened only after the Husband had appeared at the Mention Court on 2 November 2018 and asked for time to seek advice and prepare his documents and he had been given time until _16 November 2018_ to do so.

50     I should add that whilst the Husband also claimed that the car was for FIL’s use, it should be noted that FIL was not even named as a driver in the NTUC private car insurance policy.

51     On the totality of the evidence adduced before me and given the Husband’s own admission that he had no need for a car and hardly drove, I was not persuaded that there were compelling reasons for the Husband to purchase the 2016 AUDI in November 2018 and incur the current monthly expenses of $2,265.

52     Finally, I considered the Husband’s insurance expenses of $3,000 per month. A perusal of the 2- page document he had submitted for this item showed that he had bought 2 life insurance policies with AIA on the same day on _11 November 2018_.

53     Again, it should be noted that this purchase of the 2 policies was done after the Current Application was filed and also during the period given to the Husband to seek advice and prepare his documents for filing on 16 November 2018.

54     Further, these 2 policies known as LXXX AIA Smart Growth (II) 18 and LXXX AIA Smart Pro Rewards (5 pay) were savings plans. The premia paid by the Husband were not mere expense items to cover risks. There was an investment element in these policies which would benefit the Husband at the end of the terms of these policies.

55     Whilst the Husband was entitled to take up insurance policies for protection and investments, he cannot be excused from his existing maintenance obligations on the ground that his disposable income had dropped due to the monies he had decided to pay for these 2 policies. He ought to discharge his existing maintenance obligations and only invest when there was surplus income available. It should be noted that the aggregate premia of the 2 policies amounted to about $3,000 per month.

56     I want now to touch on the Husband’s 2 bank accounts. According to the Husband’s evidence, they had a combined balance of less than $115 by 16 November 2018. However, I noted from the submitted bank statements that he had been transferring monies out of these accounts to his new wife (even before their marriage). Notwithstanding these transfers and other withdrawals, during the period from July 2018 to October 2018 (when his salaries were credited into this OCBC account), this account had the following balances:

> End July 2018: About $3,029

> End August 2018: About $3,340

> End September 2018: About $4,180

> End October 2018: About $2,419

Based on the above balances, it would appear that the Husband could have discharged his monthly maintenance obligations of $3,000 in those months if he wanted to. But, he chose not to do so and went further in November 2018, to tie up his available funds for the purchase of a car for which he had no need and for the purchase of 2 AIA life insurance policies which would benefit him with investment returns in due course.

57     Even allowing his personal expenses as claimed in Table A (including his income tax instalment payments), but without taking into account his expenses for the 2016 AUDI, the 2 insurance policies monthly premia and the purported payment of FIL’s medical expenses (which collectively added up to about $8,265), the Husband’s monthly expenses would only come up to about $4,822. As mentioned earlier, the Husband was likely to be earning more than $170,000 annually (which was his base pay excluding bonuses) and $12,966 was only his minimum take- home pay per month. The Husband therefore has sufficient funds to discharge his maintenance obligations, both in respect of past arrears as well as the current maintenance payable.

58     For all the above reasons and on the evidence adduced before me, I therefore did not accept the Husband’s case that he was financially unable to pay more than $200 per month towards the arrears of $28,500.

59     All considered, I was prepared to let him pay these arrears of $28,500 in instalments and was of the view that he was capable of paying it in the 11 instalments as set out in **paragraph 16**.

60     His total monthly repayments towards his arrears (including those still owing under the Consent EMO) would therefore be $4,000 for March 2019 ($3,500 + $500) and thereafter, $3,000 per month ($2,500 +$500) until the respective arrears were paid in full.

61     Further, I gave the Husband about one (1) month (from 25 January 2019 to the end of February 2019) to arrange his financial affairs so as to effect these payments, by ordering that his first instalment payment towards the arrears of $28,500 would commence only on 1 March 2019.
