Spousal maintenance – Variation – Rescission – Material change in circumstances

15 February 2021

### District Judge Lim Keng Yeow :

## Introduction

1       This is an application by the plaintiff (“the ex-husband”) to vary the existing maintenance orders made in favour of the defendant (“the ex-wife”). I eventually made orders which would result in the ex-husband’s maintenance obligations being fully discharged after 15 months. Both parties appealed against the orders.

2       The parties in this case were married on 23 July 1992. On 13 April 2007, Interim Judgment of divorce was granted, and ancillary matters were determined on 1 April 2010. Orders made relating to maintenance of the ex-wife were that the ex-husband was to pay her:

> a)     $3,000 per month as maintenance;

> b)     $2,700 per month as housing allowance upon her vacating the matrimonial home, and

> c)     $1,000 per month as transport allowance when the motor vehicle used by her was returned.

3       On 10 November 2014, the orders were varied. The High Court, on appeal, ordered that housing allowance would be fixed at $1,500 instead of $2,700 and left the other payments to the ex-wife undisturbed. Hence, since end-2014, the ex-wife has been receiving a total of $5,500 per month in maintenance.

## The parties’ cases

4       The ex-husband filed this application seeking to discharge his maintenance obligations as regards the ex-wife. The key basis of his application is that he had retired since 26 June 2019 after working for 35 years. He was now no longer drawing any income[^1]. This, it was contended, amounted to a material change in circumstances under s 118 Women’s Charter (“WC”). In addition, it was argued that the law of maintenance was not intended to create a situation of lifelong dependency by an ex-wife on maintenance payments by an ex-husband[^2]. For these reasons, it was totally not inappropriate for his financial obligations toward the ex-wife to cease.

5       The ex-wife contested the application on the basis that she remained financially dependent on the ex-husband[^3]. She also argued that the ex-husband’s retirement and consequential loss of income at 61 years of age was self-induced. Furthermore, his retirement did not mean that he now had no financial ability to continue with payments. Hence, she contended that existing maintenance payments should continue, or at least remain for another three years[^4].

## Material change in circumstances

6       The first main issue to be determined was whether variation or rescission of existing maintenance orders was possible or warranted in the circumstances.

7       Under s 117 WC, maintenance orders in favour of a wife that are not expressed to end at any given time continue until either ex-spouse deceases, or until the wife remarries, unless the order is subsequently rescinded. Whether and when such an order is to be rescinded is provided for in s 118 WC: the court may “vary or rescind any subsisting order for maintenance…where there has been any material change in the circumstances”.

8       Not every change in circumstances satisfies the requirements of s 118 WC. In _ATS v ATT_, the High Court held that three conditions must be met[^5]:

> a)     The material change asserted is a change from circumstances prevailing during the ancillary matters hearing;

> b)     The change arose after the ancillary matters hearing; and

> c)     The change is enough to satisfy the court that a variation or rescission of maintenance is necessitated.

## Material changes on the part of the ex-husband

9       The ex-husband relied principally on his retirement and the loss of a monthly income as such a material change. The ex-wife did not dispute the fact of his termination of employment. On this issue, she contended, firstly, that the retirement represented purely self-induced circumstances. The suggestion appeared to be that the situation was brought about by the ex-husband’s own doing and allowing this would be unfair to the ex-wife. Secondly, despite his retirement, he remained capable of continuing with his obligations under the existing orders.

### (1)   Purely self-induced circumstances?

10     In arguing that the ex-husband could not rely on his retirement, the ex-wife referred to cases such as _See Toh Weng Foong v Chew Cheng Moi[^6]_, where the court did not allow the variation sought on the basis that the adverse change in circumstances was self-induced[^7].

11     In my view, the principle to be applied is not that a party can only rely on adverse changes that were forced upon the party or which the party had no choice over. That cannot be so, as the courts have clearly been willing to regard circumstances resulting from a party’s volitional choices as a material change sufficient to justify a variation in that party’s favour.

12     A good example would be the remarriage of an ex-husband. In dealing with submissions that these circumstances were brought about purely by his own choices and ought not affect his ongoing maintenance obligations, the High Court in _ANH v ANI_ held as follows:

> It is a reasonable presumption that no one remarries merely to reduce his obligations of maintenance to the ex-spouse. It is therefore not right to deride the father here for his remarriage as if it were a problem of his own making as counsel submitted. The court has no business commenting, let alone pontificating, upon whether a divorcee should marry or not[^8].

13     The remarriage carried every probability of children being produced and that the capacity of the ex-husband there to continue with maintenance payments would be affected. Despite that, the court did not treat it as representing self-induced circumstances aimed at curtailing his maintenance obligations. Instead, the court presumed the absence of such motives and wholly accepted the remarriage as amounting to a material change in circumstances.

14     That, in my respectful view, must be correct. After all, a divorced individual should have every right and liberty to move on with life and make his or her own choices in life, neither totally heedless of existing legal obligations especially to one’s children, nor having to be fettered by the possible implications of one’s choices on the ex-spouse.

15     Hence, the fact that the circumstances relied on as material changes flowed from the personal choice of a party and were therefore “self-induced” should not mean that they must be disregarded. It should be where the inference ought to be drawn that a party had strategically engineered that set of adverse circumstances in order to advance one’s position or secure an advantage in legal proceedings that it would be inequitable to allow the party to benefit from the circumstances that he or she had created.

16     On the facts of this case, there was no evidence to support such an inference. I noted the following:

> a)     The ex-husband occupied a senior position in a financial institution and drew substantial salaries exceeding _by far_ the monthly amounts he was ordered to pay the ex-wife. To suggest that he opted to lose all that simply to achieve the aim of paying less or no maintenance appeared far-fetched and needed to be substantiated. Of course, it is not beyond a person driven by spite to make such a choice. Such a motive would, however, be inconsistent with the undisputed fact that the ex-husband had already been dutifully paying her maintenance for nearly a decade, while also providing for the children solely;

> b)     Being aged 61, the ex-husband had already worked for some 35 years. I noted that he did not put forward any health-related reasons, but desiring retirement at his phase in life was neither something extraordinary nor difficult to understand. After all, it would not be unreasonable to infer that he faced stressors and demands commensurate with his high pay. Suggestions that he could or should still work for another few years were, in my view, not too far different from contending that an ex-husband should not remarry;

> c)     His entry into retirement was no small matter for him in that it was likely to be irrevocable, considering the understandable challenges in obtaining other employment for anyone at his age;

> d)     He retired as of 26 June 2019, and it was only some 8 months later that the variation application was filed on 18 February 2020, and

> e)     Stoppage of maintenance payments since December 2019 was not necessarily indicative of any particular motive as regards his earlier retirement.

17     In my judgment, the evidence before me was insufficient to support an inference that the ex-husband’s retirement was merely a strategic ploy aimed at defeating his maintenance obligations. I accepted that the retirement and the consequential loss in income and income earning capacity would amount to a material change under s 118 WC.

### (2)   Financial ability to pay has not changed?

18     An ex-husband’s retirement may not always warrant the variation or rescission of the maintenance order. What matters is whether he continues to have the financial ability to meet the maintenance order: _Foo Ah Yan v Chiam Heng Chow_[^9].

19     In the instant case, the ex-husband would have been fully conscious of the extent of his financial situation when he went into retirement. There was nothing to indicate a forced retirement or that he should be surprised by what he had gotten himself into. Hence, against his claims to have had to resort to a number of loans and redemption of insurance policies, I was not persuaded that he would voluntarily decide to go into retirement and forego his substantial salary _only_ to throw himself into financial dire straits. I drew the inference that he should be able to continue with maintenance payments, at least for some time. After all, it has obviously been for a long time that he has been commanding a substantial salary.

20     As against that, however, it was not disputed that his high monthly income saw a sudden cliff drop and came to nought with his retirement. There was also no evidence of other continuing sources of income. Even if he had some residual ability to continue with payments for a period, the zeroing of his monthly income clearly affected his financial circumstances materially.

21     In addition, it was not disputed that he had been supporting the two children of the marriage without any contribution from the ex-wife. At the time of the hearing before me, the younger child was aged only 13. Hence, the financial burden will remain for yet another decade or so and will most likely continue to be borne by him solely, until this child completes her education and attains financial independence[^10]. This, of course, bears on his ability to continue to meet the maintenance orders in time to come.

22     As mentioned earlier, the ex-husband would obviously have gone into retirement fully conscious of his existing financial obligations. However, that fact, by itself, cannot mean that he _must_ continue to be held to the full extent of the existing orders regardless. Once again, a comparison with remarriage is probably apt. Every ex-husband enters into remarriage conscious of his existing maintenance obligations. This has, however, not resulted in the courts applying the prior obligations inflexibly and refusing any variation.

23     I accepted that, while his financial ability to continue to meet the maintenance orders could stand for some time, that was not sustainable beyond a certain point. The retirement would come to limit his financial ability to continue to meet the maintenance orders and clearly represented an adverse material change in circumstances for him.

## Material changes on the part of the ex-wife

24     I turn now to deal with the ex-wife’s financial circumstances.

25     She contended that she would remain financially dependent on the ex-husband and asked for the maintenance payments to continue for another three years. Against that, however, it was clear that certain material changes have taken place, all indicating that she was now in a much better position than at the time of the divorce or even in 2014 when the maintenance orders were last varied.

### (1)   Two sets of material changes

26     The _first_ set of material changes relate to her professional development over the past few years. Some one to two years after the ancillary orders were made, the ex-wife relocated to Paris in 2015 and had lived there until now. She undertook a Diploma in Pastry course from Le Cordon Blue, Paris and completed it a year after her relocation. Since then, she worked as a pastry chef, gaining relevant experience in that field.

27     According to her, in June 2020 she earned the equivalent of S$1,179. This was through work of a part-time nature, which she claimed to be limited to. That was because, being considered not sufficiently proficient in the French language, she had not acquired a French work visa to engage in full-time work.

28     The amount she reported to earn (on that particular month) was indeed not a large one. I had to exercise some caution in this regard, as it was only based on a single payslip for the month of June 2020 that she stated what her current income was. It was insufficient to support a finding that, in other months, she only worked that number of hours and obtained only that amount.

29     Furthermore, by the time of the hearing, she was nearly completing her French Language course and was already in the process of obtaining the work visa. A successful application would enable her to work full-time as a pastry chef. Even if that application were to fall through, I noted that her income earning _capacity_ had clearly improved significantly since the time of the last variation, with her qualifications and valuable work experience.

30     While not a material change by itself, it was appropriate to note that the ex-wife was not rebuilding her income earning capacity from nothing. She was certainly not without professional skills and training from her past. Being an air stewardess and business owner formerly, her past experience would have provided a good base from which she had developed herself over the past few years.

31     The _second_ key material change sets this case apart from many others. In many cases, an erstwhile homemaker, while coping with the emotional fallout from the divorce, may have to grapple with the many challenging realities and burdens of being a single parent to school-going children, while struggling to re-enter the workforce to gain financial independence. That is often unimaginably trying. In this case, however, from the point of her relocation to France, at least, the ex-wife neither had any real contact or involvement with the children nor continued to bear any family responsibilities.

32     How this came about was not relevant in these proceedings. I took this fact into account without the slightest criticism of her as a mother and without downplaying any emotional impact this could have. The important point to note was that, unlike in many other cases, the ex-wife was neither in _any_ way saddled with the day-to-day care of her children nor concerned with _any_ financial burden over them, at least for the past five years.

33     Being fully released from all such parenting and familial responsibilities and obligations, she was absolutely free to make a fresh start and live her own life, channelling all her energies and resources toward pursuing her own interests and devoting herself fully to her professional development. That was what she rightly and necessarily did.

34     Taking into account the combination of the above circumstances, I saw no reason why she should not be expected to soon become fully financially independent, whether in Paris or elsewhere. After all, it has been many years since the divorce, and five years of having one’s time fully at one’s disposal would obviously have afforded a good and fair opportunity for anyone in her position to re-establish oneself financially and professionally.

### (2)   Dire financial circumstances?

35     I now address her claims that her financial circumstances remained dire, even to the point where she remained in debt to various parties. I considered those claims in light of the following:

> a)      _The ex-wife’s share from the division of matrimonial assets_. It was not disputed that she obtained the value of $703,545.45. While she emphasised that the ex-husband was given a larger share, the relevant fact now was that she did receive a very sizeable amount and it was obviously one which would have fully taken into account her contributions to the marriage and family.

> b)      _Her HDB flat purchase and rental proceeds_. She was an owner of a HDB flat which she acquired on her own. While she did take out a bank loan, she had sufficient means to make the necessary cash payments without utilising her share of the assets. The flat has also been tenanted out, and she received rental of some $2,100.

> c)      _Spousal maintenance received over the years_. On top of her share of the matrimonial assets, she had been receiving regular and substantial amounts of spousal maintenance over the past decade or so. This was initially $6,700 per month (amounting to $80,400 per year) and varied to $5,500 from November 2014 (amounting to $66,000 per year). I had no doubt that, even by themselves, they were enough to enable her to live quite comfortably.

> d)      _Money at her disposal was purely for her own use_. In terms of her expenses, she had no financial obligations as regards the children, as mentioned earlier. Her list of expenses did not indicate any payment toward the support of any dependents. So whatever amounts she received all this while were _exclusively_ for her own use and to meet _her_ own needs.

In light of these circumstances, I did not find it satisfactorily explained why she had to resort to multiple loans from others, or that any personal loans should remain outstanding. I rejected her claims.

36     Overall, I was totally not persuaded that the ex-wife’s financial circumstances were as dire as she made them out to be. I was unable to accept the key objection she put forward, that for the next three years or more, she had to continue to be dependent on the ex-husband for her upkeep.

## The orders to be made

37     Flowing from the above, I determined that there were material changes on the part of _both_ parties supporting a variation of existing orders in the ex-husband’s favour.

38     In deciding on how to balance the many considerations and material changes in this case, I derived guidance from the observations of the High Court that a spousal maintenance order is not to be regarded as a meal ticket for life and should not intended to create life-long dependency by an ex-wife on the ex-husband[^11]. Rather, a maintenance order should be aimed mainly at assisting with the transition especially by an ex-wife who has been economically disadvantaged by the erstwhile role of a homemaker to post-divorce life[^12].

39     These were not merely recent developments. The principle may well have been established at least by 1995, where the High Court observed that an ex-wife was expected to “exert herself, secure a gainful employment, and earn as much as reasonably possible”, especially where she was “free to live her own life and her time (was) at her disposal”[^13].

40     Guided by the above, my judgment was that the material changes and many considerations in this case were best balanced by allowing the maintenance orders to come to an end after a reasonable duration following the hearing.

41     I determined that the maintenance payments should not cease immediately, nor should any change be backdated. This was because the ex-wife was still in the process of securing her work visa and the ex-husband’s ability to pay would remain for some time.

42     The payments should, however, cease after a period of time, given the reality of the ex-husband’s monthly income having come to nothing for some months already. The cessation should not cause the ex-wife hardship in light of my assessment of her overall financial circumstances.

43     As to how long this period should be, I sought to balance my assessment of the ex-husband’s means and my assurance that the ex-wife was well on her way toward achieving financial independence with two other considerations. Firstly, I noted her present situation in Paris with the Coronavirus pandemic continuing to affect businesses. Secondly, I also wanted to give some allowance in case her application for her work visa failed again. Hence, I provided for the remaining payment to cease after 15 months. The maintenance orders would be rescinded with effect from 1 February 2022.

44     I considered an alternative approach of reducing the maintenance quantum and allowing the orders to continue to run. I decided against this principally on the basis that the financial circumstances of the parties did not either require or favour this. In addition, I was also of the view that the circumstances are such that parties can finally be allowed a clean break.

45     An unfortunate reality of allowing the orders to continue to exist is that further subsequent variation applications may still have to be made. Such an application would typically mean the prying into private information on each other’s financial circumstances and each being forced to account for his or her personal choices in life to the other (e.g. whether one ought to be retiring).

46     It may not accord well with the intended effect of a divorce where, so many years after the relationship ought to have been finally and absolutely severed, the ex-spouses still have to be put through the strain and cost of litigation, get to intrude into each other’s lives or be required to divulge to each other private information, and have the right and standing to question and attack each other’s personal choices and expenses. Where the material changes justify it, as is so in this case, allowing parties a clean break should always be the preferred option.

## Conclusion

47     It is hoped that with my orders soon ending the final outstanding issue in the divorce in this case, this whole rather unfortunate and understandably difficult aspect of the parties’ lives can now truly find closure. Both of them can, and should, fully and finally move on with their own lives.
