Family law – Ancillary Matters – Access – Division of Matrimonial Assets

8 July 2019

### District Judge Michelle Elias Solomon:

## Introduction

1       The parties in these proceedings are husband and wife. Both Singapore citizens, they were married on xxx April 2014 in Singapore. The Plaintiff/Wife (“the Wife”) commenced FC/D 155/2018 on 10 January 2018 against the Defendant/Husband (“the Husband”) seeking a dissolution of the marriage. There is one child to the marriage, B (“the Child”), who was born on xxx 2016. The Husband works as a police officer and the Wife works as a sales and reservation executive.

2       The Husband and Wife (“the Parties”) went through the Child Focused Resolution Centre (“CFRC”) process, and the Interim Judgment was granted on 16 May 2018 on an uncontested basis.

3       On 20 August 2018, the Parties recorded a consent order on interim access and interim maintenance in the following terms (“the Interim Order”):

> 1.     The Husband shall have access to the child of the marriage every Wednesday from 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.

> 2.     Every Saturday from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. or Sunday from 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m., to be confirmed by the parties by Thursday 2:00 p.m. immediately prior to the access.

> 3.     The Husband shall pick up and drop off the child at the Wife’s parents’ residence.

> 4.     The Husband shall pay the monthly sum of $450 to the Wife as maintenance for the child of the marriage with effect from 21 August 2018 and thereafter on the 21st day of each subsequent month.

> 5.     In addition, the Husband shall make the following payments directly:

>> a)       100% of all insurance premiums for the child; and

>> b)       100% of all medical expenses for the child, with the use of his civil service card. The Husband shall pay the cash portion of the difference, after the necessary discounts are applied using his card.

> 6.     All maintenance payments shall be deposited directly into the Wife’s POSB Account No. xxx.

4       The Parties were unable to reach an agreement on the final orders to be made in the ancillary matters, and filed their respective affidavits.

5       The ancillary matters came up for hearing before me on 23 January 2019. At the hearing, the court was informed that the Parties agreed to joint custody of the Child[^1]. The issues for determination before me were therefore:

> (a)     care and control of the Child, including the issue of access; and

> (b)     maintenance for the Child;

> (c)     maintenance for the Wife;

> (d)     the division of matrimonial assets.

## The Orders Made

6       The ancillary matters were heard on 23 January 2019. The hearing ended with directions for each party to file an update affidavit on matters relating to access, income and expenses[^2]. Judgment was reserved to a date following the filing of the update affidavits.

7       The Parties’ update affidavits were filed on 18 February 2019 and the Order was delivered on 25 March 2019[^3]. Having considered all of the evidence and submissions, I made the following orders (“the Order”):

> 1.     By consent, the Husband and Wife shall have joint custody of the Child.

> 2.     The Wife shall have care and control of the Child with reasonable access to the Husband as follows:

>> a)       every Monday from 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. (including dinner for the Child);

>> b)       every Wednesday from 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. (including dinner for the Child);

>> c)       every Friday from 6:30 p.m. to Saturday 6:30 p.m. (overnight access);

>> d)       every Father’s Day from 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.;

>> e)       every birthday of the Husband, from 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.;

>> f)       every alternate Public Holiday from 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. (commencing Good Friday 2019).

> 3.     The Husband shall pick up and drop off the Child at the Wife’s residence before/ after access.

> 4.     The Wife and Husband shall each have an unbroken block of time with the Child for half of each of her school holidays. The parties shall be at liberty to discuss and agree on the split of the school holidays, but in default of any agreement the Husband shall have the first half of each such holiday in odd years (i.e. with effect from 2019) and the second half in even years (i.e. with effect from 2020).

> 5.     The Wife and Husband shall be allowed, subject to the consent of the other parent and such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, to bring the child overseas during her school holidays. The party intending to travel shall furnish the other party with the travel itinerary and relevant contact details at least 3 weeks before the commencement of the travel.

> 6.     Where there is a clash in the provisions above, the order of priority, in descending order, shall be as follows:

>> a)       School holiday arrangements;

>> b)       Public holiday arrangements. Where the public holiday falls within a school holiday, the affected public holiday shall not be counted in the reckoning of alternate public holidays; and

>> c)       Regular weekly arrangements.

> 7.     The Wife shall update the Husband on events / appointments at the Child’s school, including Parent-Teacher Meetings, school concerts and other meetings / events which would normally require the attendance of at least one parent. Notwithstanding that the Wife is the parent having care and control of the Child, the Husband should always have the option of attending these appointments / events in the spirit of joint parenting. The Husband may also approach the Child’s school directly for particulars in respect of such meetings/ events.

> 8.     In the event that the Child is unwell during the Husband’s access times, the Husband is allowed to visit the Child at the Wife’s residence for up to 30 minutes.

> 9.     The parties shall be at liberty to:

>> a)       vary the care arrangements under this order by mutual agreement;

>> b)       agree to any other additional or make-up access as they see fit.

> 10.     The Wife and Husband shall attend counselling at DSSA.

> 11.     The Husband shall pay the monthly sum of $770 to the Wife as maintenance for the Child with effect from 1 April 2019 and thereafter on the 1st day of each subsequent month.

> 12.     In addition, the Husband shall also be responsible for:

>> a)       67% of the Child’s school fees;

>> b)       67% of enrichment classes and/or extra-curricular activities. Such enrichment classes and/or extra-curricular activities shall be discussed and agreed between the Parties;

>> c)       100% of all insurance premiums for the Child;

>> d)       100% of all medical expenses for the Child, with the use of his civil service card. The Husband shall pay the cash portion of the difference, after the necessary discounts are applied using his card.

> 13.     There shall be no maintenance for the Wife.

> 14.     All maintenance payments shall be deposited directly into the Wife’s POSB Account No. xxx.

> 15.     In respect of the matrimonial home, the following orders are made:

>> a)       Within 3 months of the Final Judgment, the matrimonial flat/property shall be transferred (other than by way of sale) to the Wife with no CPF refunds to be made to the Husband’s CPF account and no cash consideration to the Husband. The Wife shall bear the costs of the transfer and take over the outstanding mortgage.

>> b)       If, for whatever reason, the Wife is unable to take over ownership of the matrimonial property in the terms above, then within 6 months of the Final Judgment, the matrimonial flat/property shall be transferred (other than by way of sale) to the Husband upon the Husband making the full required CPF refunds to the Wife’s CPF account. The Husband shall:

>>> i.       bear the costs of the transfer

>>> ii.       take over the outstanding mortgage; and

>>> iii.       pay the Wife a cash portion equivalent to the difference between $127,754 and her full CPF refunds.

>> c)       If, for whatever reason, neither party is able or willing to take over ownership of the flat, then within 9 months of the Final Judgment, the matrimonial home shall be surrendered to the HDB. Any losses shall be apportioned between the parties in accordance with the prevailing HDB/CPF rules and regulations.

> 16.     The Registrar or Assistant Registrar of the Family Justice Courts under section 31 of the Family Justice Act 2014 is empowered to execute, sign, or indorse all necessary documents relating to matters contained in this order on behalf of either party should either party fail to do so within seven days of written request being made to the party.

> 17.     Each party shall retain all other assets in their respective names.

> 18.     No order as to costs.

> 19.     Liberty to apply.

8       Both parties, being dissatisfied with parts of the Order, filed Notices of Appeal. The Husband’s appeal is only in respect of the division of matrimonial assets and the Wife’s appeal is only in respect of access (“the appeals”). These grounds will therefore deal with these two issues.

## The Evidence - Affidavits filed in respect of the proceedings

9       A total of eight affidavits were filed by the Parties in respect of the proceedings:

> (a)     Wife’s Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 3 July 2018 (“**W1**”);

> (b)     Wife’s 2nd Ancillary Affidavit filed on 4 October 2018 (“**W2**”);

> (c)     Wife’s 3rd Ancillary Affidavit filed on 17 December 2018 (“**W3**”);

> (d)     Wife’s Update Affidavit filed on 18 February 2019 (“**W4**”).

> (e)     Husband’s Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 3 July 2018 (“**H1**”);

> (f)     Husband’s 2nd Ancillary Affidavit filed on 4 October 2018 (“**H2**”);

> (g)     Husband’s 3rd Ancillary Affidavit filed on 12 December 2018 (“**H3**”);

> (h)     Husband’s Update Affidavit filed on 18 February 2019 (“**H4**”).

## The Wife’s Appeal - Access

10     The Order granting care and control to the Wife is not the subject of the appeals. The Wife’s appeal is limited to the following access orders:

> 1.     The Husband shall have access to the Child as follows:

>> a)       every Monday from 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. (including dinner for the Child);

>> b)       every Wednesday from 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. (including dinner for the Child);

>> c)       every Friday 6:30 p.m. to Saturday 6:30 p.m. (overnight access);

>> d)       every Father’s Day from 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.;

>> e)       every birthday of the Husband, from 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.;

>> f)       every alternate Public Holiday from 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. (commencing Good Friday 2019).

> 2.     The Husband shall pick up and drop off the Child at the Wife’s residence before / after access.

> 3.     The Wife and Husband shall each have an unbroken block of time with the Child for half of each of her school holidays. The parties shall be at liberty to discuss and agree on the split of the school holidays, but in default of any agreement the Husband shall have the first half of each such holiday in odd years (i.e. with effect from 2019) and the second half in even years (i.e. with effect from 2020).

> 4.     The Wife and Husband shall be allowed, subject to the consent of the other parent and such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, to bring the child overseas during her school holidays. The party intending to travel shall furnish the other party with the travel itinerary and relevant contact details at least 3 weeks before the commencement of the travel.

> 5.     Where there is a clash in the provisions above, the order of priority, in descending order, shall be as follows:

>> a)       School holiday arrangements;

>> b)       Public holiday arrangements. Where the public holiday falls within a school holiday, the affected public holiday shall not be counted in the reckoning of alternate public holidays; and

>> c)       Regular weekly arrangements.

#### The Wife’s case for access

11     The Wife proposed access to the Husband in these terms[^4]:

> 1.     Every Wednesday from 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.; and

> 2.     Every Saturday from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. or Sunday from 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m., to be confirmed by parties by Thursday (2:00 p.m.). Failure for parties to confirm or agree on alternative arrangements shall result in access being set, by default, on Saturday from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.

12     In her submissions, she cited the importance of maintaining the status quo (essentially the access she was proposing) which had been in place for over a year. She also relied on the following additional reasons:

> 1.     The Husband was solely dependent on the Wife for the care of the Child[^5];

> 2.     The Husband’s hostile conduct towards her which has ‘spilled into the access arrangement’, which would directly impact the Child[^6];

> 3.     The Husband had ‘pulled various stunts’ such as threatening not to return the Child after access and, on one occasion, keeping the Child overnight without informing the Wife causing her much worry and trauma[^7].

> 4.     The Husband stalked and harassed the Wife’s family members[^8] and refused to allow the Child to be part of the Wife’s sister’s wedding, and created much problems for her[^9].

> 5.     Creating many problems for the Wife whenever she requests for a change to the access time[^10].

#### The Husband’s case for access

13     The Husband sought liberal access in these terms[^11]:

> 1.     After school pick-ups every day;

> 2.     On Mondays from 5:30p.m. to 8:30 p.m.;

> 3.     Overnight access from Thursday after school to Saturday 7:30 p.m.;

> 4.     Birthday & Father’s Day access;

> 5.     Half of public holidays, childcare closure and school holidays;

> 6.     Overseas holidays twice a year, up to two weeks per trip; and

> 7.     When the Child was on medical leave, for one hour in the Wife’s residence.

14     In his submissions, he cited the Wife’s difficult and uncooperative conduct in negotiating access arrangements. He also relied on the following additional reasons:

> 1.     The Husband had, in the past, cared for the Child overnight and everything had gone well[^12];

> 2.     The Wife had committed acts of alienation, including refusing to share details of the Child’s ailments[^13], not allowing the Husband to pick up the Child after school for the purposes of sending her home and unilaterally attempting to change the Child’s childcare[^14];

> 3.     The Wife was dishonest about her availability to care for the Child[^15];

> 4.     The Wife had separation anxiety with the Child, which led her to be unreasonably possessive[^16];

> 5.     The Wife had a lot of pent up hatred towards the Husband due to his inappropriate chats with other female persons[^17].

#### Conclusion on access

15     In considering the Parties’ evidence and submissions on access, I noted the voluminous affidavit evidence from each party on their conduct – both in general and in relation to the Child. Each accused the other of being irresponsible, self-centred and acting contrary to the Child’s best interests. Each argued that the other’s evidence should not be believed as it was self-serving. Each accused the other of deliberately making life difficult for the other.

16     What emerged from the myriad of allegations, however, was that both the Parties craved a relationship with the Child. The Parties also had the support of their respective families in caring for the Child, and it was heartening to note that the Child was adored by her parents, grandparents and extended family. It was simply unfortunate that the breakdown of the marriage was taking its toll on the ability of the Husband and Wife to successfully co-parent. This did not mean, however, that the court should not make orders that promote and require joint parenting.

17     At the time of the hearing, the Child was living with the Wife, who was her primary care-giver. This had been the arrangement since the Wife moved out of the matrimonial home, together with the Child, in December 2017. In considering the Child’s welfare and best interests, I ordered care and control to the Wife with reasonable access to the Husband in stipulated terms. While I did not consider it to be in the Child’s best interests to change her current living arrangements, I took the view that appropriate access terms, including overnight access, were required for the Child to build a good relationship with her father.

18     In my view, a child of this age would enjoy spending one overnight a week with her father and accordingly ordered overnight access on Friday nights. There was nothing in evidence to suggest that the Husband was incapable of looking after the Child overnight. I noted the demands on the Husband’s work schedule, in that he may be required to work on some Saturdays. Due to the nature of his work, I accepted that this may sometimes be unavoidable. In the brief grounds released to the Parties when the Order was delivered, I impressed upon the Parties that in the event that access needed to be re-scheduled, common sense should prevail and Parties should not be combative with each other in re-arranging access.

19     I also considered the Husband’s request for daily pick-ups from the Child’s school, but I did not determine this to be workable in view of the potential logistical issues. The Husband worked a full-time job and would need to activate his mother as a back-up option in the event that he was unable to leave work. He has also proposed giving the Wife 24 hours’ notice in the event of changes to this arrangement. In view of the Parties’ history and the difficulties associated with agreeing to alternative (or make-up) access arrangements, I did not consider it appropriate to make such access orders.

20     The difficulties that the Parties also experienced with the alternate Saturday/ Sunday option under the Interim Order demonstrated that frequent interactions between Husband and Wife on _when_ access was to take place gave rise to much conflict. It also set the stage for many heated arguments to take place, including the disagreement over access on the day of the Wife’s sister’s wedding. For these reasons, I took the view that weekly access must be fixed and uncomplicated so that the Parties could be assisted in their post-divorce transition.

21     In my view, the Wife’s proposal on access (that is, two hours on a Wednesday evening and three hours on a Saturday or Sunday) did not provide sufficient time during the week for the Child to interact with her father. I also noted the Wife’s position on other access – she was clear in wanting to limit access to these two days by stating that ‘the Defendant (Husband) is not to have access to the child at any other times save as stated at paragraphs (a) and (b)’[^18].

22     I did not consider this to be a reasonable position because school holidays, Father’s Day and birthdays were meaningful times that the Child should be able to spend with her father. Allowing the Child to spend sufficient time with both her parents would allow her to build healthy relationships with them both, and I considered this to be in the Child’s welfare and best interests.

23     In view of the acrimonious relationship between the Parties, I was of the view that a more structured court order governing access was better suited, at least for now. For these reasons, I made the access orders that are now the subject of the Wife’s appeal.

## The Husband’s Appeal – Division of Matrimonial Assets

24     The Husband appealed against these orders which were made on the division of matrimonial assets:

> 1.     Within 3 months of the Final Judgment, the matrimonial flat/property shall be transferred (other than by way of sale) to the Wife with no CPF refunds to be made to the Husband’s CPF account and no cash consideration to the Husband. The Wife shall bear the costs of the transfer and take over the outstanding mortgage.

> 2.     If, for whatever reason, the Wife is unable to take over ownership of the matrimonial property in the terms above, then within 6 months of the Final Judgment, the matrimonial flat/property shall be transferred (other than by way of sale) to the Husband upon the Husband making the full required CPF refunds to the Wife’s CPF account. The Husband shall:

>> a)       bear the costs of the transfer;

>> b)       take over the outstanding mortgage; and

>> c)       pay the Wife a cash portion equivalent to the difference between $127,754 and her full CPF refunds.

> 3.     If, for whatever reason, neither party is able or willing to take over ownership of the flat, then within 9 months of the Final Judgment, the matrimonial home shall be surrendered to the HDB. Any losses shall be apportioned between the parties in accordance with the prevailing HDB/CPF rules and regulations.

25     Parties owned an HDB flat, which was their matrimonial home (“the flat”). The flat had a net value of about $127,078[^19]. There was also about $365,200 in other assets to be divided which was listed in the Wife’s Written Submissions filed on 21 January 2019[^20] (“the list of the Parties’ assets”). There was no evidence or submissions (written or oral) seeking to exclude assets from this list or include assets into this list. Based on the evidence and submissions, including the oral submissions made at the hearing and the update affidavits filed by the parties after the hearing, I understood there to be no dispute over the pool of other assets to be divided.

26     It therefore came as a surprise when, about ten days after the Order was made, a Request for Further Arguments (“RFA”) was received[^21] from the Husband, requesting that further arguments be considered by the court on the issue of determining the pool of matrimonial assets. In his RFA, the Husband submitted that:

> (a)     the pool of matrimonial assets should be confined to the matrimonial home; and

> (b)     he was ‘blind-sided by the sudden change of position’, which came to light when the Wife filed her written submissions before the hearing.

27     The Husband, through his counsel, also stated in the RFA:

> We have no quarrel with the assessment of parties’ contributions (direct or indirect) in the division of the matrimonial assets.

> …

> If the Plaintiff had declared her position sooner, we would have put in various evidence, such as the fact that the Defendant’s CPF funds, country club membership, and shares were fully or partly acquired before the marriage.

28     The first difficulty with the Husband’s RFA is that there is no provision for it under Division 59 of the Family Justice Rules 2014, under which the Husband’s appeal was filed.

29     The second difficulty is that the matters raised in the RFA were not raised at all during the hearing of the ancillary matters, despite the Husband being aware of the Wife’s position at the time. In fact, when specifically asked by the court during the hearing if there were other assets to divide, the Husband’s counsel informed the court of the club membership worth $15,000[^22]. If the Husband sought to exclude this asset from the pool, as he asserts in his RFA, this should have been told to the court. This was not done.

30     In the course of the hearing, the Wife’s counsel also sought leave to amend the list of the Parties’ assets to include the values of two insurance policies which the Husband owned. In the list of the Parties’ assets, the insurance policies were listed as an _item_, but the _values_ were absent. In the column labelled ‘value of property’, there was a remark stating ‘No Claim’. Apologising for the oversight, the Wife’s counsel submitted that these insurance policies should go into the pool for division[^23], and that the Wife was seeking 30% of these assets. The Husband’s counsel did not object to the inclusion of the values of the two insurance policies into the list of the Parties’ assets and no submissions were made at this time on the exclusion of any assets from the pool to be divided.

31     After the hearing on 23 January 2019, there was also ample opportunity for the Husband to alert the court of his position as set out in his RFA. Update affidavits were filed by the Parties on 18 February 2019, and the decision was delivered on 25 March 2019. All this transpired _after_ the Husband became aware that the Wife was claiming 30% of the other assets as set out in the list of the Parties’ assets, yet nothing was conveyed to the court, either through the Husband’s update affidavit or through further submissions.

32     The Husband’s counsel also did not raise these arguments at the delivery of the decision on 25 March 2019, a hearing at which both counsel attended. Copies of the Order, together with typed copies of the brief grounds, were circulated to both counsel at the start of the hearing. The court went through all the orders and brief grounds, and heard arguments on costs thereafter. In fact, the Husband’s counsel submitted that, based on the totality of the order, no costs should be ordered as “both sides had their own reasons for making submissions”[^24]. I agreed with this submission and made no order as to costs accordingly.

33     Having regard to the evidence and submissions as a whole, including the lapse of time between the hearing date and the delivery of the decision, the arguments raised in the RFD appeared to me to be afterthoughts by the Husband following the decision which was delivered. The determination of the Parties’ respective shares of the assets was based on what was represented in affidavit evidence, written submissions and oral submissions during the hearing. Final orders were made and the case was concluded. Being dissatisfied with the outcome, the Husband now sought to exclude certain assets from the pool of assets to be divided. This appears to be the only basis for the Husband’s appeal, as his RFA states:

> With utmost respect, we would like to respectfully request for a quick response from the Learned Judge, as the deadline for appeal is coming soon. Our client hopes to avoid an appeal, and seeks an expedient resolution to this matter.

34     I did not consider the RFA because the submissions raised therein could have been made much earlier, before the conclusion of the proceedings, but they were not. The Husband was represented by counsel throughout the proceedings, and submissions on the division of matrimonial assets proceeded on the basis of the list of the Parties’ assets. In my view, that would have been the time to raise the arguments in the RFA – not two months after the fact when the court had already delivered its decision.

35     A party dissatisfied with an outcome should not be allowed to re-argue a case in this manner. This would, in my view, set a troublesome precedent. For these reasons, I did not consider it appropriate to hear further arguments based on the Husband’s RFA. The Husband filed his appeal following the notification that his RFA was refused.

36     I set out below the reasons for the orders which are now the subject of the Husband’s appeal.

#### The Wife’s case on the division of matrimonial assets

37     In her submissions for the division of the matrimonial home, the Wife sought 48% of its net value[^25]. She also sought 30% of the other assets[^26], comprising monies in bank accounts, CPF monies, insurance policies, a Singapore Swimming Club Membership, shares and the Husband’s motorcar (for which there was an outstanding loan). The Wife also specifically sought an order that she be given the option to retain the flat, explaining that her family members would assist her financially in this endeavour[^27].

38     I was invited by the Wife to draw an adverse inference against the Husband for his failure to make full and frank disclosure of his assets. However, I was of the view that the evidence and submissions did not support any reason to draw such an inference.

#### The Husband’s case on the division of matrimonial assets

39     In his submissions for the division of the matrimonial home, the Husband sought an order awarding the Wife between 17% to 33.5% of the net value[^28]. He also submitted that he should be given first rights to take over the flat because[^29]:

> (a)     The Wife initially did not express interest in taking over the flat. The ‘suspicious’ change in position suggested that she only wanted to take over the flat because the Husband had expressed an interest in doing so;

> (b)     In the event that the Wife was granted care and control of the Child and moved back into the matrimonial home, this would be an upheaval for the Child;

> (c)     The Husband had doubts over whether she could afford to take over the flat.

40     For the other assets, the Husband submitted that each party should retain these assets held in their respective names[^30].

#### Conclusion of the division of matrimonial assets

41     In summary, the total assets to be divided were valued at $492,278 and comprised:

> (a)     $127,078, being the net value of the matrimonial home; and

> (b)     $365,200, being the net value of other assets to be divided, of which $37,159 comprised the Wife’s assets and $328,041 comprised the Husband’s assets.

42     There was no dispute over the ratio of the Parties’ direct financial contributions to the assets, the details of which are set out in the table below:

43     I now turn to the parties’ indirect contributions. In arriving at a just and equitable division of the matrimonial assets, the court is not expected to undertake a forensic exercise at the hearing of the ancillary matters. The Court stated in the case of _ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGCA 34</span> (“_ANJ v ANK_”), at Para 24:

> Contributions in the form of parenting, homemaking and husbandry, by their very nature, are incapable of being reduced into monetary terms. No mathematical formula or analytical tool is capable of capturing or accommodating the diverse and myriad set of factual scenarios that may present themselves to the Court as to how the parties may have chosen to divide amongst themselves duties and responsibilities in the domestic sphere’.

44     After considering the evidence and each party’s submissions, and having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the length of marriage, and pool of assets to be divided, and in adopting the structured approach in _ANJ v ANK_, I was of the view that Parties’ indirect contributions should be 55% in favour of the Wife. I was of the view that 55% to the Wife was appropriate in view of her contributions towards homemaking and raising the Child. Although a domestic helper was employed for some of the time to assist in the household chores, she remained the primary caregiver to the Child and was committed to matters of the home. This brought the aggregate ratio to 33.5: 66.5 according to this calculation:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="34.4868973794759%"> <col width="32.4064812962593%"> <col width="33.1066213242649%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Wife</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Husband</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Direct Contributions</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">12%</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">88%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Indirect Contributions</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">55%</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">45%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Aggregate ratio</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>33.5%</b></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>66.5%</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

45     Accordingly, the Parties’ entitlement following this division would be as follows:

> (a)     Wife’s entitlement: $164,913 \[33.5% of $492,278\]

> (b)     Husband’s entitlement: $327,364 \[66.5% of $492,278\]

46     Of this sum of $164,913 which the Wife was entitled to, $37,159 comprised her own assets. The difference was therefore $127,754, which represented the Wife’s final entitlement under my order. Since the Wife’s final entitlement under my order essentially covered the net value of the matrimonial home[^33], I ordered that the flat be transferred to her without her needing to pay any consideration to the Husband, including any CPF refund. Although the Wife’s final entitlement of $127,754 was about $676 more than the net value of the flat, I did not consider this sum of $676 significant against the pool of assets, and in adopting a broad-brush approach in making these ancillary orders, I was of the view that a separate payment of $676 from the Husband to the Wife was unnecessary.

47     In recognition of the Child’s housing needs and having regard to the Order which granted care and control of the Child to Wife, I granted the Wife the first option to retain the matrimonial home so that she and the Child may have a place to live. In the event that she was unable to take over the flat, I ordered, in the alternative, that the Husband could do so instead. The third and final option under the Order was for parties surrender the flat because, at the time of the hearing, the Parties had not owned the flat for a minimum period of five years and the Minimum Occupation Period still applied[^34].

## Conclusion

48     Overall, I considered the orders on the division of matrimonial assets to be consonant with the orders relating to the Child. Under the Order, the Wife and Child would have a permanent place to stay, with the Wife appearing to have a reasonable chance of being able to afford to retain the flat. With the paramount consideration being the welfare of the Child, I was of the view that the orders in totality were fair and reasonable, having regard to all the circumstances of the case.

49     Having regard to the all the ancillary orders made, I considered it appropriate that there be no orders as to costs.
