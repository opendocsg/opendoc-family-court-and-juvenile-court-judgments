Family Law – Women’s Charter – Matrimonial assets – Division – Matrimonial Home – Central Provident Fund – Maintenance of Wife – Maintenance of Child

24 December 2020

### District Judge Jason Gabriel Chiang:

1       This case involved a dispute between a local 68-year old husband and a 36-year old Vietnamese wife over the ancillary matter issues of division of matrimonial assets as well as spousal and children maintenance in divorce. During the course of the hearings for the matter, significant arguments were raised including issues relating to the assessment of the pool of matrimonial assets, particularly in relation to purported premarital CPF monies, and the issue of the matrimonial home.

2       On 14 September 2020, I ordered that the Wife was entitled to 35% of the matrimonial assets and the Husband was entitled to the remaining 65%. As parties had confirmed that they were seeking the orders to only apply to the division of the Matrimonial Flat, I ordered that it be sold. Factoring the other matrimonial assets held by parties, the Wife was awarded 40% of the nett sale proceeds of the Matrimonial Flat, while the Husband got the remaining 60%. I further ordered that there be no maintenance for the Wife but that the Husband bears 75% of the reasonable expenses for the Children. After factoring that they would be paying for the Children while they are under their respectively care and control, this effectively amounted to the monthly sum of S$657.50 for the Husband’s payments for the maintenance of the Children. This maintenance sum comprised of monthly payment of S$320 (i.e. S$160 for each child) and a further proportionate sharing of the Children’s school fees, school textbooks, school uniforms, school shoes, telephone charges and medical fees on a reimbursement basis.

3       On 24 September 2020, the Husband being dissatisfied with my decision, filed an Appeal against my orders. The full grounds of my decision are set out below.

## Facts

### The parties

4       The Plaintiff/Wife (the “**Wife**”) and the Defendant/Husband (the “**Husband**”) married on 9 April 2003. At that point in time the Wife was Vietnamese, but subsequent to marriage the Husband sponsored the Wife for Singapore Citizenship, which was granted in June 2006.

5       The Husband was a widower who had two (2) sons at the time of marriage: one who was in Junior College and another was studying in the University at that time. The Wife was merely 19 years old when she married the Husband and relocated from Vietnam to Singapore.

### Background to the dispute

6       The Wife first filed for divorce against the Husband sometime in 2009 but decided to withdraw this sometime in 2010.

7       The Wife then filed for divorce for a 2nd time on 2 May 2019. After mediation, parties proceeded for an uncontested divorce hearing on the grounds of divorce. Parties also agreed to the Joint Custody of their two (2) children, a boy aged 16 (the “**Son**”) and a girl aged 15 (the “**Daughter**”) (collectively referred to as the “**Children**”), as well as shared care and control of the Children. Under this shared care and control, the Wife would have the Children from Mondays after school to Fridays before school and the Husband would have the Children from Fridays after school to Mondays before school.

8       On 18 November 2019, Interim Judgment, FC/IJ 5411/2019, was thus ordered on the basis of four (4) years’ separation and on the agreed terms relating to the custody and care and control of the Children. Parties claimed to have maintained separate households since 2015. However, it is noteworthy that, at the time of the hearings, parties were still residing at the Matrimonial Flat, albeit in separate rooms since then to the time of the Ancillary Matters hearings. The Wife alleged that she would only share meals with the Husband for the purposes of the Children, and besides that they maintained separate households.

9       For the Ancillary Matters, the Wife was represented by legal counsel, but the Husband was a litigant in person. The matter was heard over two half-day hearings on 19 August 2020 and 14 September 2020. At the 1st Hearing, I confirmed with the Husband that he did not have legal counsel and that he did not wish to be represented by a lawyer. Be that as it may, the Husband was able to present case law and make legal submissions for his case.

10     Parties had only filed two (2) rounds of affidavits for the ancillary matters. Neither side formally applied for discovery or interrogatories by summons against the other party. The Husband submitted his 1st set of written submissions (“**Husband’s 1st Submissions**”), checklist and ancillary matters fact and position sheet on 11 August 2020. The Wife filed her 1st set of Written Submissions (“**Wife’s 1st Submissions**”) on 12 August 2020, with a further bundle of authorities.

11     On 14 August 2020, the Wife’s counsel requested that the Wife be granted leave to be present for the hearing. On 17 August 2020, the Husband replied that he was in agreement with this. In the circumstances, leave was granted for the Wife to be in attendance for the hearings.

12     A day before the hearing (i.e. 18 August 2020), the Wife filed a 6-page Reply Submissions to the Husband’s Submissions (“**Wife’s Reply Submissions**”) and a further bundle of authorities. The Husband confirmed that he had received the Wife’s Reply Submissions and got to review this before the hearing. At the 1st half-day hearing on 19 August 2020, the Husband belatedly tried to admit further documents, such as a CDP Statement, a hospital medical bill, a message from the Wife to the Husband and a google translation of the message. I allowed the admission of the CDP Statement, as there had been allegations that the Husband has not made full and frank disclosure in this regard. The other documents were reviewed and assessed to be irrelevant for the proceedings.

13     After the 1st half-day hearing on 19 August 2020, I directed the Wife’s Counsel and the Husband to file supplementary submissions addressing the questions that I had raised during the hearing, which they were unable to adequately address on at that juncture. The directed supplementary submissions were filed on time by both sides on 9 September 2020 (hereinafter referred to as the “**Wife’s Supplementary Submissions**” and the “**Husband’s Supplementary Submissions**”). However, the Husband also filed a further reply submission prior to that on 3 September 2020 (the “**Husband’s Reply Submissions**”). On the 2nd half-day hearing on 14 September 2020, the Husband belatedly presented a new authority of **_TZQ v TZR_** **<span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHCF 3</span>** (“**_TZQ v TZR_**”). I heard further arguments from both parties on this and other outstanding issues that parties had not adequately addressed in the Supplementary submissions.

14     Having considered all this, I delivered my decision at the close of the 2nd half-day hearing on 14 September 2020 that:-

> (a)     the Wife is entitled to 35% of the matrimonial assets, whereas the Husband is entitled to 65% of the matrimonial assets;

> (b)     the entitlement to the matrimonial assets translated into the Matrimonial Flat being sold on the open market within 6 months of the order or whatever further extension of time that Parties mutually agree to in writing. Parties shall have joint conduct of the sale of the Matrimonial Home;

> (c)     the nett sale proceeds of the Matrimonial Home shall be apportioned in the ratio of 40% to the Wife and 60% to the Husband. Each party shall utilize their shares of the nett sale proceeds of the Matrimonial Home to refund their CPF monies withdrawn for the purchase of the Matrimonial Home plus accrued interest;

> (d)     the Husband shall be at liberty to buy-over the Wife’s share of the Matrimonial Home at an agreed price or at market rate;

> (e)     the Registrar or Deputy Registrar of the Family Justice Courts under Section 31 of the Family Justice Act (Act 27 of 2014) is empowered to execute, sign, or indorse all necessary documents relating to matters contained in this order on behalf of either party should either party fail to do so within 7 days of a written request being made to the other party;

> (f)     Parties shall retain all other assets in their own names. Parties shall have no future claims in relation to such assets;

> (g)     there shall be no maintenance for the Wife or the Husband;

> (h)     on the basis of parties having shared care and control as stated in FC/IJ 5411/2019, the Husband shall pay to the Wife a sum of S$320 for the household maintenance of the Children (i.e. S$160 per child per month). The Parties shall maintain the Children when they are within their care and control. The above-mentioned maintenance is to be paid on or before the 1st day of each month with effect from this order and is to be deposited into the Wife’s bank account.

> (i)     the Wife and the Husband shall further share the costs of the Children’s school fees, school textbooks, school uniforms, school shoes, telephone charges and medical fees in the following proportions of 75% being borne by the Husband and 25% being borne by the Wife. This is on a reimbursement basis within 7 days upon provision of receipts by the paying party to the other party with payments being made into Parties’ respective bank accounts.

> (j)     no order as to costs; and

> (k)     liberty to apply.

## The parties’ cases

15     In relation to the division of matrimonial assets, both parties agreed that that the Court should take into account all the matrimonial assets but that the division should only be applied to the Matrimonial Flat. However, there was dispute over the value of the Matrimonial Flat, and whether certain assets or part thereof should be included in the pool of matrimonial assets. The Husband contended that certain CPF sums and traced assets from insurance proceeds should be excluded from the pool. There was no agreement on the direct and indirect financial contributions and both sides alleged that the other failed to make full and frank disclosure thus an adverse inference should be drawn against the other party. Separately the Husband also argued that the Court should clawback monies that the Wife purportedly dissipated for the Children’s bank accounts.

16     With regard to the maintenance of the two (2) Children, the Wife estimated the Children’s expenses to be S$1,550.00, whereas the Husband estimated the Children’s expenses to be S$1,330.00. The Wife proposed that a fair compromise would be S$1,450.00. The Wife sought that the Husband bear 80% of this sum, amounting to S$1,160.00. Given the shared care and control arrangement and parties’ financial status, the Husband argued that each parent pay for the household expenses when the Children live with them, and that each parent also directly bears for one (1) Child’s non-household expenses. Notwithstanding the orders previously made on the custody, care and control and access of the Children, the Husband also tried to argue under the Children’s maintenance that the Court should order that the Children spend half of the school holidays with each parent and for each parent to keep one (1) Child’s passport and birth certificate.

17     At the end of the hearing on 19 August 2020, I had questioned the Husband on how the issue of the Children’s school holidays and the holding of the passports and birth certificates constituted issues that can be determined under Children’s maintenance. The Husband conceded that it was not within the purview of Children’s maintenance and withdrew such requests.

## Issues to be determined

18     In the circumstances the outstanding issues related to the division of the matrimonial assets and the maintenance of the Children as follows:-

> (a)     What is the operative date for the assessment of the pool of matrimonial assets and what is the operative date that they should be valued at;

> (b)     Whether the Court should adopt the Global or Classification Methodology for assessment;

> (c)     Whether the marriage should be considered a Dual Income or a Sole Income union and what is the effective length of the marriage;

> (d)     How should the Matrimonial Flat be treated as a matrimonial asset or part thereof;

> (e)     Valuation of the Matrimonial Flat;

> (f)     Whether the Courts should exclude the pre-marital CPF monies and the manner in which it should do so;

> (g)     Whether the Courts should exclude the pre-marital insurance monies and the manner in which it should do so;

> (h)     Whether the Court can order a clawback of monies purportedly dissipated by the Wife to the bank accounts of the Children;

> (i)     What are parties’ direct financial contributions to the matrimonial assets;

> (j)     What are parties’ indirect financial and non-financial contributions to the marriage and family;

> (k)     Whether there should be any adjustment for the weightage of the two (20 factors;

> (l)     How the division of matrimonial assets translates to the division of the Matrimonial Flat;

> (m)     Whether there should be any adverse inference to be factored in;

> (n)     Whether there should be any further adjustments for other factors; and

> (o)     How should parties share in their contributions for the Maintenance of the Children.

19     As the parties had reached an agreement on other Children issues, which was recorded in paragraph 3(b)(i) to (iv) of the Interim Judgment, FC/IJ 5411/2019. In the circumstances, it was unnecessary to into such further issues especially with the Husband’s withdrawal of his prayers for overseas travels, birth certificates and passports being couched as terms of Children maintenance.

## Issue 1: What Operative Date should be adopted for assessing the pool of Matrimonial Assets and the Date that they should be valued at?

20     The Court of Appeal in **_TND v TNC & Another appeal_** \[**2017\] SGCA 34** has set out four (4) general dates that the Court would usually consider for the operative date of the determination of what constitutes the pool of matrimonial assets: (1) date of separation; (2) date of when petition for divorce is filed; (3) date of interim judgment and (4) date of hearing of ancillary matters. The default is the date of the interim judgment be used to determine the pool of matrimonial assets. This is because the interim judgment would put an end to the marriage and indicate that the parties no longer intend to participate in the joint accumulate of matrimonial assets. It would require special reasons for the Court to exercise its discretion to depart from this norm.

21     The Husband takes the position that the court should determine the Matrimonial Flat as at the date of separation in May 2015 but that all other matrimonial assets should be assessed as of the date of the interim judgment. The Wife, on the other hand, alleged that there were no special reasons to depart from the interim judgment date for the assessment of matrimonial assets.

22     While parties still reside at the same residence, it is their accepted allegation that they have been maintaining separate households since May 2015. There was thus a significant period of time of about five (5) years between the date of separation and the date of interim judgment. The Wife has not provided any evidence to show that parties continued to consider their finances to be joint after such date. In fact, parties had relied on the four (4) years’ separation for the grounds of irretrievable breakdown of the marriage for the uncontested divorce. Moreover, given the maintaining of separate households, this indicated that parties no longer intended to participate in the joint accumulation of matrimonial assets. In the circumstances, I found it appropriate and reasonable to hold that the operative date for determining the pool of matrimonial assets should be the separation date. I disagreed with the Husband that there should be two (2) different dates for assessment of the Matrimonial Falt and the other matrimonial assets. However, as will be seen later in my decision, this had little effect on the certain assessment of the pool of matrimonial assets save for the issue of CPF sums and insurance pay-outs.

23     Regarding when assets should be valued, I am bound by the Court of Appeal ruling in **_TDT v TDS_** **<span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 145</span>**, that the general position is that the valuing of matrimonial assets should be as of the date of the ancillary matters hearing. In this case there are no special circumstances to warrant a departure from this presumptive position, save for in relation to the bank accounts and CPF accounts. As held at \[35\] of **_USA v USB_** **<span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHCF 4</span>**, these are unique assets in that their value is tied to the quantum of funds therein. Hence, for monetary assets the date that should be adopted is the operative date for assessing the pool as opposed to non-monetary assets, which should consider the date of the ancillary matters hearing.

24     In any event, I had to use the best available information provided by parties to determine the value of the matrimonial assets as of interim judgment or the ancillary matters hearing accordingly.

## Issue 2: Should the Courts apply the Global or Classification Methodology

25     As elucidated by the Court of Appeal in **_AYQ v AYR and another matter_** **<span class="citation">\[2013\] 1 SLR 476</span>; <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGCA 66</span>**, for the global assessment method, the Court makes an overall assessment of the parties’ relative direct and indirect contributions to the marriage and then applies that assessment to the entire pool of matrimonial assets. For the classification method, the Court divides the matrimonial assets into classes and conducts a separate analysis of the parties’ direct and indirect contributions to each asset class. This is would be more appropriate where there are multiple asset classes where each party had made different contributions to each asset class. Notably neither method is inherently superior to the other, they are simply different arithmetical means to achieve the same statutory end of dividing the matrimonial assets in a just and equitable way.

26     In this case, the direct financial contributions of the Wife are pretty consistent, she only made direct financial contributions to the assets that were under her sole name. The Husband made all other direct financial contributions to the assets. In the circumstance, I found that there was little utility in utilizing the classification approach, and I agreed with the Wife that the global method is more appropriate than the classification approach in this case.

27     I further found it inconsistent for the Husband to claim that he wanted the Court to adopt the classification approach to deal with the Matrimonial Flat as a class in its own and then to deal with all the other matrimonial assets, whether quintessential or non-quintessential, as a separate class and, at the same time, also propose that he wanted the Court to make orders for the retention of all the assets in his sole name and to only factor the overall division of matrimonial assets to divide up the Matrimonial Flat.

## Issue 3: Dual or Sole Income Marriage & Length of Marriage

28     Parties were in agreement that the marriage was a dual income marriage, instead of a single income one. The Husband had been the main breadwinner of the family, but the Wife began work in the later years of the marriage and had made some direct financial contributions throughout certain years of the marriage.

29     Given that parties were married on 9 April 2003 and Interim Judgment was pronounced on the agreed grounds of 4 years separation, on 9 May 2019, the marriage would have at least been from 2003 to 2015 when parties separated, i.e. 12 years. However, if we consider the date up till when Interim Judgment had been pronounced, that would have been 16 years. In either case, this would be a marriage of moderate length and not a short or long marriage.

30     In the circumstances, pursuant to the ruling in **_TNL v TNK_** **<span class="citation">\[2017\] 1 SLR 609</span>**, it was undisputed that the structured approach in **_ANJ v ANK_** **<span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span>** (“**_ANJ v ANK_**_”_) was applicable in this case for determining what a just and equitable outcome for the division of matrimonial assets would be.

## Issue 4: How the Matrimonial Flat should be treated

31     The Husband initially relied on section 112(1)(b) of the Women’s Charter that the Matrimonial Flat had only been partially acquired during the course of marriage, as he had purportedly acquired the property and paid for 78.5% of the payments prior to marriage. The Husband then in the Supplementary Submissions argued that the Matrimonial Flat is covered by section 112(10)(a)(ii) of the Women’s Charter on the basis that it was an asset acquired before marriage but transformed to a matrimonial asset due to substantial improvement. In this regard, the Husband relied on the opinion of Professor Leong Wai Kum stated in _Elements of Family Law in Singapore_ (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2013) at p 577, where Professor Leong suggested that the Courts should only look at the increase in value of the property as part of the pool of matrimonial assets.

32     However, the real issue was whether the Matrimonial Flat was the Matrimonial Home of parties and the Children under section 112(10)(a)(i) of the Women’s Charter. On this point, the Husband had conspicuously made no submissions on, notwithstanding that I had pointedly asked both the Husband and the Wife’s Counsel to consider this issue and to make submissions on the same. This issue was once again broached at the 2nd Hearing, the Husband argued that the Matrimonial Flat was not the Matrimonial Home as it did not fulfill all the purported criteria in section 112(1)(a)(ii) of the Women’s Charter as he read both parts (i) and (ii) as requirements to be fulfilled together. In this regard it is important to point out that provisions under section 112(1)(a)(i) and (ii) of the Women’s Charter are disjunctive and not conjunctive, by the use of the word “_or_”. As such, so long as either limb is fulfilled, it is a matrimonial asset, not that both limbs have to be fulfilled for it to be a matrimonial asset.

33     The Wife initially provided different approaches on the division of matrimonial assets whereby she considered the Husband’s position on only 21.5% of the Matrimonial Flat having been acquired after the marriage.

34     As mentioned above, at the 1st Hearing, I had raised the question as to why the Matrimonial Flat was being analyzed through the lens of section 112(10)(b) of the Women’s Charter, for assets acquired during the marriage by either or both parties as opposed to section 112(10)(a)(i) of the Women’s Charter on Matrimonial Home. The Wife’s Counsel informed the Court that she had provided different approaches, one of which included considering the Matrimonial Flat in full. The Court directed that the Wife to elect which position to take or at least which position she would prioritize over the others.

35     The Wife, in the Supplementary Submissions, then confirmed her position that the Matrimonial Flat should be treated as the matrimonial home and wholly included in the pool of matrimonial assets.

36     It is trite law that the matrimonial home under section 112(1)(a)(i) would be a matrimonial asset in full and not apportioned based on acquisition after the marriage. The Statement of Claim confirms that the Matrimonial Flat was the last location where the Wife and Husband lived together as husband and wife. It is therefore indisputable that the Matrimonial Flat is the Matrimonial Home. Being such, the position in law is that the whole of the property be included in the pool of matrimonial assets being divided.

## Issue 5: Valuation of the Matrimonial Flat

37     The Wife’s position was that the Matrimonial Flat is should be the median sale price sum of S$650,000. The Husband, however, insisted on it being valued at S$600,000, which was the sale price of a unit of the same size in the same floor range (i.e. similar storey of the HDB Block) and space area of the Matrimonial Flat sold in December 2019. There was no agreement between parties on the value of the Matrimonial Flat.

38     In this regard, I agreed with the Wife’s position. The latest HDB Flat sold in August 2020 was for S$698,000. It was of a 5-room HDB with a floor area of 121 sqm, which is slightly smaller than the Matrimonial Flat. While this was two (2) blocks away, it was in the same floor range as the Matrimonial Flat. Its remaining lease was less than that of the Matrimonial Flat, but only by a couple of months. In the circumstances, there was no reason to not take the price of the last sold HDB flat of similar specifications for considering the value of the Matrimonial Flat. Averaging out the selling prices of the HDB flat sold for S$600,000.00 and the HDB flat sold for S$698,000.00, this came up to about S$650,000.00. Taking into consideration the evidence of all the sale prices of other similar HDB flats sold, the average is also about S$650,000.00.

39     Hence, I determined the value of the Matrimonial Flat to be S$650,000.00.

## Issue 6: Whether to apportion premarital CPF Monies as part of the matrimonial assets or to exclude the same

40     The Husband argued that S$113,950.07 of his CPF balance of S$171,179.42 as of May 2015, the date of separation, be deducted from the pool of matrimonial assets as they represented the sum of CPF he had in April 2003 prior to the marriage as well as what would be the expected interest earned on such CPF monies.

41     The Wife argued that the holding in **_TND v TNC_** **<span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 34</span>** (“**_TND v TNC_**”) at \[37\] applied, in that the Court should decline to pro-rate the CPF monies in the absence of detailed evidence of CPF contributions in each year of the marriage. In the further case of **_UHG v UHH_** **<span class="citation">\[2017\] SGFC 116</span>** (“**_UHG v UHH_**_”)_, cited by the Wife, District Judge Kathryn Thong also found no basis to exclude the pre-marital CPF monies particularly when parties had used their CPF monies to purchase the matrimonial home, as it went against the raison deter of section 112(10)(a)(i) of the Women’s Charter to expand the pool of matrimonial assets to cover those which parties had treated as part of their domestic lives together, irrespective of when the same were acquired.

42     In this case, it is undisputed that the Husband did use his CPF monies during the course of the marriage towards the paying off of the mortgage for the Matrimonial Home. There was further no documentation provided on his detailed evidence of CPF contributions in each year of the marriage.

43     As mentioned earlier, the Husband at the 2nd Hearing belatedly submitted the case of **_TZQ v TZR_** **<span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHCF 3</span>** (“**_TZQ v TZR_**”) that the Court should exclude premarital CPF sums. However, I accepted the Wife’s Counsel’s argument that the case of **_TZQ v TZR_** only stands for the proposition that pre-marriage CPF sums should be excluded if the CPF was not comingled. Given that the CPF monies were used for the mortgage payments for the Matrimonial Home, this distinguishes this case from the circumstances in **_TZQ v TZR_**. Given that monies came in and out of the Husband’s CPF account for the Matrimonial Flat and other purposes, without full documentation, it was not possible to decipher what was the premarital CPF Sum and what would be the interest accrued on the same. The Husband provided an estimation by CPF, but even this document explained that this would only be applicable if no monies had been withdrawn from the CPF account.

44     In the circumstances, based on the Court of Appeal case of **_TND v TNC_**, which was further expounded upon in **_UHG v UHH_**, I found no reason to exclude the premarital CPF monies from the pool of matrimonial assets. I thus including the full sum of CPF monies as of the date of separation, which was S$171,179.42.

45     It is notable that a few days after I had reached my decision, the Husband did attempt to admit further evidence which he claimed would be able to fully account for his CPF sums. However, even though the Husband had ample opportunity to provide such documents for the determination of the matter, the Husband had not done so and only belatedly tried to introduce such evidence, which was readily available to him, after I had delivered my oral decision on the matter.

## Issue 7: Whether to apportion premarital Insurance Monies and the traced assets as part of the matrimonial assets or to exclude the same

46     The Wife argued that the principle relating to CPF monies should apply equally for there to be no apportionment of insurance payouts for premarital and postnuptial sums on the basis that some premiums were paid before and after the marriage.

47     The Husband, however, argued that he received the payout of S$75,324.43 in May 2018 from the maturity of his insurance policy, which he then utilized to invest in S$70,000 Singapore Savings Bonds. Thus, this Singapore Savings Bond were traced from the insurance payout.

48     As opposed to CPF funds which were applied to the Matrimonial Home, the insurance monies had not been used in the same fashion and are only acquired during the course of the marriage pursuant to section 112(10)(b) of the Women’s Charter through premium payments. Given the operative date being the separation date and the term for maturity of the insurance policy being 25 years (meaning the policy was purchased in 1993), I agreed with the Husband that only a share of 12/25 should be included in the pool of matrimonial assets, given the 12 years between 2003 and 2015, i.e. the date of separation.

49     However, I did not agree with the manner in which the Husband had made his calculations. The Husband claimed that he had utilized S$75,324.43 to acquire S$70,000 Singapore Savings Bond. However, nothing had been stated about the remaining S$5,324.43, which is presumed to have been spent. The way that the Husband apportioned the sums deducts the sum of S$5,324.43 which has not been accounted for.

50     In this case, I found that a fairer position is to apportion 12/25 of the current S$70,000 Singapore Savings Bonds as part of the Matrimonial Assets, i.e. S$33,600.00.

## Issue 4: Whether to clawback money to the Children’s accounts

51     In this regard, I agreed with the Wife that there should be no clawback into the Children’s accounts or into the pool of matrimonial assets.

52     The Wife stated that she had closed the Children’s joint accounts with her and opened replacement accounts, save that some sums were used to pay for legal fees and other expenses. The Husband claimed that the sums in the Children’s joint accounts amounted to an aggregate of S$9,001.84, whereas the new account merely had S$1,250.00. While pursuant to **_UFU v UFV_** **<span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHCF 23</span>**, sums used to pay for legal fees should not be deducted from the pool of matrimonial assets, there was insufficient evidence presented as to how much was spent on legal fees as opposed to other expenses, which could be legitimate expenses. In any event, in the greater scope of matrimonial assets, such sums were not significant and would not have had a significant impact on the pool of matrimonial assets to be divided.

53     The Husband was not clear in his arguments as to whether he considered such sums to be part of the pool of matrimonial assets or whether such sums belonged to the Children and not the Wife. If it is the latter, then, this would come outside the purview of ancillary matters.

54     As the Wife argued that the monies in the Children’s new bank account was her money that she had been saving on behalf of the Children, the monies therein were included in the pool of matrimonial assets.

## Issue 9: Direct Financial Contributions

55     In the circumstances, the following are the Husband’s Assets which are included in the pool of matrimonial assets, which he made 100% direct financial contributions for:

56     And the following are the Wife’s Assets, which she made 100% direct financial contributions to:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="9.8%"> <col width="54.8%"> <col width="35.4%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>S/N</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Asset</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="right" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Value (S$)</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">CPF Monies</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="right" class="Table-Para-1">59,791.70</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">POSB Account</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="right" class="Table-Para-1">1,915.04</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">UOB Account</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="right" class="Table-Para-1">1,252.08</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">OCBC Account</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="right" class="Table-Para-1">3,420.84</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">5.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">POSB Children’s accounts</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="right" class="Table-Para-1">1,150.00</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">TOTAL</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="right" class="Table-Para-1">S$67,529.66</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

57     As the sums, were not provided as of the separation date, I had to take into account the best available value that was disclosed by the Wife in her documents.

58     Overall, the pool of matrimonial assets amounted to S$934,972.28.

59     Hence, the Wife had contributed 7.2% of direct financial contributions and the Husband had contributed the remaining 92.8%.

## Issue 10: Indirect Contributions to the Family

60     For the indirect contributions, both the Wife and Husband claimed to be the primary caregivers of the Children. The Husband claimed that he contributed 80% of indirect contributions whereas the Wife claimed that she contributed 70% of indirect contributions.

61     I note that the Wife had uprooted herself from her home country to come to Singapore and had cared for 2 young Children, especially in their formative years. At least before she began working, she was the primary person caring for the Children. I also note that the Wife did help care for the Husband’s adult sons, even though such care would not be as significant as they were adults by the time she married into the family.

62     Given that the agreement on care and control is that the Wife having 4 out of the 7 days of the week, I am inclined to the view the Wife remains as the primary caregiver. However, I note that the Husband may also have significant contributions as he was the one paying for the bills, for the Children’s activities and shows a lot of care for the Children, which is why I am only awarding the Wife 60% of the indirect contributions.

## Issue 11: Weightage of Ratios

63     In **_USB v USA and another appeal_** **<span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 57</span>** at \[41\] to \[42\], the Court of Appeal reiterated that the Court has the discretion to adjust weightage of direct and indirect contributions in a short marriage, but there could well be good reasons to return equal weightage in short marriages especially when children are involved. Besides in cases of short marriages, adjusting the weightage of direct and indirect contributions is the exception instead of the norm. Do depart would require cogent reasons.

64     In this case, I agree with the Wife that there were no cogent reasons for the weightage not to be equal as opposed to a 70:30 weightage initially proposed by the Husband. Parties had two (2) Children and the marriage, regardless of whether we consider the length up to separation or interim judgment, could not be said to be short marriage.

65     Based on the Husband’s Supplementary Submissions, he appeared to have conceded that it should be equal weightage as his calculations were made on the basis that the weightage was equal between direct and indirect contributions. I thus ordered equal weightage between the two (2) ratios.

66     On that basis, averaging out the 2 ratios, the following would be parties’ entitlement to the pool of matrimonial assets, with minor adjustment on a broad-brush approach:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="44.12%"> <col width="28.34%"> <col width="27.54%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Contributions</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Husband</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Wife</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Direct</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">92.8</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">7.2</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Indirect</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">40</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">60</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Overall</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">66.4</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">33.6</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Broad-brush approach adjustment</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">65</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">35</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

## Issue 12: Division of Matrimonial Assets on the basis of dividing the Matrimonial Flat

67     As parties’ position in their Ancillary Matters Fact and Position Sheets and as confirmed at the hearings, were for parties to retain all their assets and only divide the Matrimonial Flat, I considered on how each parties’ entitlement to the pool of matrimonial assets could be translated to the division of the Matrimonial Flat only.

68     Therefore, the Wife’s 35% of the pool of matrimonial assets of S$934,972.28 would be S$327,240.30. After deducting the value of the Wife’s own assets of S$67,529.66, the Wife should get S$259.710.64 of the Matrimonial Flat. Taking this into consideration of the value of the Matrimonial Flat, this would translate to 39.95%, which I rounded up to an even number of 40% of the Matrimonial Flat.

## Issue 13: Issue of Adverse Inference, if any

69     As further clarified in the Court of Appeal case of **_UZN v UZM_** **<span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 109</span>**, for an adverse inference to be drawn, the following needs to be satisfied:-

> (a)     Substratum of evidence establishing a _prima facie_ case against the non-disclosing party; and

> (b)     Non-disclosing party must have had some particular access to the information he is said to be hiding.

70     These factors were not satisfied by either the Husband or the Wife in relation to their allegations in this case. Furthermore, it is unclear how such alleged nondisclosure by either the Husband or the Wife had a significant impact on the declared matrimonial assets.

71     Notably, with regard to the allegations of adverse inference by the Wife against the Husband, the questioned transactions occurred in 2019. Given that I had determined the operative date for the bank accounts to be the date of separation, such issues were irrelevant. As such, I am not making any finding of adverse inference on this front either.

72     With regard to the Husband’s allegations of the Wife’s failure to make full and frank disclosure, this related to relatively minor sums, which I was of the view that the Wife had adequately addressed in her affidavits and submissions. The Husband’s suspicions that the Wife should have more earnings given her history of work and as compared to his sums in his CPF, were purely conjecture, and were not rooted in any persuasive evidence.

## Issue 14: Adjustment for other factors, if any

73     Parties have not presented any convincing arguments for any adjustments to be made to take into account of other factors. Similarly, I also did not find there to be any further reasons for an adjustment in the percentages, save for the broad-brush approach mentioned above.

74     At this juncture, I would like to highlight the case of **_UYP v UYQ_** **<span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 551</span>** cited by the Wife, that the Court of Appeal has affirmed that the Courts should not be adopting a rigid, mechanistic and overly-arithmetical application of the structured approach in **_ANJ v ANK_** and that parties should not be attempting to dredge up every record, which may obfuscate instead of illuminate on the key issues at hand. Moreover, the Court of Appeal also affirmed that the broad-brush approach remains relevant and applicable and that parties in their conduct of their case should focus on the major details.

75     In the circumstances, I found the end result on the division of the Matrimonial Flat to be just, reasonable and equitable.

76     It should be highlighted that even though parties had made arguments on the basis that the Matrimonial Flat was to be sold on the open market, after delivering my oral grounds of decision on the division of matrimonial assets, the Husband belatedly asked that he be provided the option to buy over the Wife’s share of the Matrimonial Flat. In the circumstances, I made further orders for the Husband to have the option to buy over the Wife’s share of the Matrimonial Flat at market value or other agreed upon price.

## Issue 15: Maintenance of the Children

77     Both parties had agreed that there would be no maintenance for the Wife. For the avoidance of doubt, given this agreement, I ordered that there be no maintenance for the Wife or Incapacitated Husband (even though no allegations of incapacity had been raised, this was included to provide further clarity that this was not an issue in this case).

78     With regard to the sharing of the reasonable expenses of the Children between the Wife and the Husband, the High Court in **_TBC v TBD_** **<span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 103</span>; <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 59</span>** (“**_TBC v TBD_**”) at \[24\] cited the decision in **_XB v XC_** **<span class="citation">\[2008\] SGDC 144</span>** (“**_XB v XC_**”) that:-

> 33    It is true that parents have equal responsibility under the law over the children, in that the law does not place responsibility for financial provision solely on the shoulders of the father. In that regard, the law does not also prescribe that childrearing is to lie within the province of the mother, notwithstanding the dictates of certain cultural norms. Furthermore, **parental responsibility should be equal in that either party should be willing, able and ready to play any parenting role unless one is incapacitated for whatever reason**. If one party were thus incapacitated, the other parent should be willing, able and ready to take on the responsibility hitherto held by the incapacitated parent.

> 34    But **equality in responsibility does not necessarily suggest equality in financial contribution regardless of each parent’s financial means.**

> 35    How different parents in different families apportion their parental responsibilities and organise their finances is entirely up to them. But where the court has to make a determination on this matter on behalf of the parents who cannot agree, regard must again be had to section 68 WC, which applies equally to the father and the mother. **It clearly states that the financial provision must depend on each parent’s financial means. Where there is clear disparity in the financial means of both parents, it is only right that the courts take that into account**. From one who has more, more is naturally expected. Before the courts, parents should be required to contribute in proportion to their means. \[emphasis added\]

79     The High Court observed at \[27\] of **_TBC v TBD_** that while the starting point should be that the parents bear the financial burden equally, this is not an inflexible rule if one parent is unable to contribute equally compared to the other parent, then that parent should contribute what he or she can, and the other parent should make up the shortfall, so that the child would receive the full measure of maintenance.

80     Furthermore, Valerie Thean JC, as Her Honour was then, in **_TIT v TIU_** **and another appeal <span class="citation">\[2016\] 3 SLR 1137</span>** at \[61\] also affirmed the position in **_XB v XC_** stating:

>     In this context, while the law regards both parents as equally responsible, it does not regard all parents as equally able or capable. As noted by the district judge in _XB v XC_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGDC 144</span> (at \[34\]), “**equality in responsibility does not necessarily suggest equality in financial contribution regardless of each parent’s financial means**”. \[emphasis added\]

81     The Wife had estimated the Children’s expenses to be S$1,550.00 (based on Son’s expenses being S$850 and Daughter’s expenses being S$700). Whereas the Husband estimated the Children’s expenses to be S$1,330.00. Hence, the Wife had proposed n the Wife’s 1st Submissions that a fair compromise would be to settle on the average amount of S$1,450.00, which the Husband rejected.

82     The Wife was seeking that the Husband pay 80% of this compromised sum amounting to S$1,160 per month. This was purportedly based on parties’ income.

83     The Husband, however, proposed in the Husband’s 1st and Supplementary Submissions that:-

> (a)     Each party to pay for the household expenses when the Children live with that party;

> (b)     Each party to pay directly for one child’s non-household expenses (e.g. school pocket monies, transport, textbooks and unfirms etc.)

> (c)     Party who arranged for holiday with the children be responsible for the travelling expenses.

> (d)     The Husband shall pay for the school fees of the Children to compensate for the 1 days’ worth of household expenses for when the Children live with the Wife.

84     While both parents have equal responsibility to maintain the Children, this does not mean that parties should bear equal costs. In the circumstances, I took regard to parties’ financial means. In this respect, I note that based on the disclosed Notices of Assessment and pay-slips, the Wife’s overall average income is about S$2,708 per month, including bonuses.

85     Based on the Notices of Assessment disclosed by the Husband, his annual income for FYA 2019 was S$108,000. This would mean that he would have been earning S$9,000 per month. However, for FYA 2020, the Husband’s annual income curiously dropped to S$26,000, which amounted to about S$2,166,67 per month. Notably, for FYA 2020, this would be tracking the income for the calendar year of 2019, as such, this would not have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. It was further curious that the Husband’s annual income for FYA 2018 was S$72,000 (i.e. S$6,000 per month) and for FYA 2017 was S$84,881 (i.e. S$7,073.42 per month), All these declared annual income sums were significantly higher than that in FYA 2020. Even though there were fluctuations in the Husband’s income from year to year, the Husband had been working at the same job throughout, where he had been under the employment of his adult son. It bears mentioning that as the company is owned and run by the Husband’s adult son, the Husband’s salary could easily be adjusted. The variance in income is significant, being close to a S$7,000 range between S$9,000 and S$2,166.67. The Husband argued at the hearing that it was because his work involved projects. However, he had provided no documentary of this. All the Husband provided was his employment contract with his son’s company. The Husband’s argument on projects was not stated on affidavit and was only a submission from him at the hearing itself.

86     Based on the significantly higher earning potential of the Husband, I ordered that the Husband pays for 75% of the Children’s expenses and that the Wife pays for the remaining 25% of the Children’s expenses.

87     Having considered the evidence presented by Parties on the Children’s expenses, I found that a reasonable sum for the Children’s household expenses of Food, Transport, Utilities and Pocket Money to be S$1,000 per month, i.e. S$500 per Child per month. This does not include the Children’s school fees, school uniforms, textbooks, medical and telephone charges, which are estimated to be another S$450.

88     Given that the Husband would have to care for the Children on three (3) out of the seven (7) days of the week (i.e. 42.9% of the time), he would be fully paying for the Children’s household expenses during such time. As such, he would need to contribute another 32.1% of the household expenses for the Children to make up 75%. As such, the Husband is ordered to pay to the Wife a sum of S$320 per month for the two (2) Children to top up the sum (i.e. S$160 per child per month).

89     I also further ordered that the Husband pays for 75% and the Wife pays 25% of the Children’s school fees, textbooks, uniforms and school shoes, medical expenses and telephone fees within seven (7) days of receipts being provided, depending on who purchases the items for the Children.

90     Effectively, this would translate into the Husband paying a monthly sum of about S$657.50 for the two (2) Children based on the current estimates provided.

91     It is noteworthy that, as of the time of the two (2) hearings, the Husband and Wife were still residing together with the two (2) Children in the Matrimonial Flat, albeit the Husband and the Wife were residing in separate rooms, and alleged that they had maintained separate households save for the sharing of some meals for the sake of the Children. Given the sale of the Matrimonial Home ordered, this arrangement would be unlikely to persist. The orders for the maintenance of the Children took this into account and it was based on parties’ agreement for shared care and control and the division of time between parties.

## Costs

92     After delivering my oral grounds of decision, I requested for parties to submit on the issue of costs. The Wife and Husband made no submissions for costs against the other. Overall, I found that neither the Wife nor the Husband had been fully successful in their claims, each of them had been more successful in certain aspects and less successful in other aspects. In the circumstances, I made no order as to costs.

## Conclusion

93     In the circumstances, I made the following orders for this case:

> (a)     the Wife is entitled to 35% of the matrimonial assets, whereas the Husband is entitled to 65% of the matrimonial assets;

> (b)     the entitlement to the matrimonial assets translated into the Matrimonial Flat being sold on the open market within 6 months of the order or whatever further extension of time that Parties mutually agree to in writing. Parties shall have joint conduct of the sale of the Matrimonial Home;

> (c)     the nett sale proceeds of the Matrimonial Home shall be apportioned in the ratio of 40% to the Wife and 60% to the Husband. Each party shall utilize their shares of the nett sale proceeds of the Matrimonial Home to refund their CPF monies withdrawn for the purchase of the Matrimonial Home plus accrued interest;

> (d)     the Husband shall be at liberty to buy-over the Wife’s share of the Matrimonial Home at an agreed price or at market rate;

> (e)     the Registrar or Deputy Registrar of the Family Justice Courts under Section 31 of the Family Justice Act (Act 27 of 2014) is empowered to execute, sign, or indorse all necessary documents relating to matters contained in this order on behalf of either party should either party fail to do so within 7 days of a written request being made to the other party;

> (f)     Parties shall retain all other assets in their own names. Parties shall have no future claims in relation to such assets;

> (g)     there shall be no maintenance for the Wife or the Husband;

> (h)     on the basis of parties having shared care and control as stated in FC/IJ 5411/2019, the Husband shall pay to the Wife a sum of S$320 for the household maintenance of the Children (i.e. S$160 per child per month). The Parties shall maintain the Children when they are within their care and control. The above-mentioned maintenance is to be paid on or before the 1st day of each month with effect from this order and is to be deposited into the Wife’s bank account.

> (i)     the Wife and the Husband shall further share the costs of the Children’s school fees, school textbooks, school uniforms, school shoes, telephone charges and medical fees in the following proportions of 75% being borne by the Husband and 25% being borne by the Wife. This is on a reimbursement basis within 7 days upon provision of receipts by the paying party to the other party with payments being made into Parties’ respective bank accounts.

> (j)     no order as to costs; and

> (k)     liberty to apply.
