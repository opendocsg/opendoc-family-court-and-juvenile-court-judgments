Child maintenance, Wife maintenance

3 May 2019

### District Judge Nicole Loh:

1       This is an application by a Wife against her Husband for maintenance for herself and their 1-year-old child.

2       The Wife and Child moved out of the matrimonial flat in May 2018 and moved into a shelter whilst the Husband continued to reside at the matrimonial flat. On 13 August 2018, the Wife filed the application for maintenance.

## Orders Made

3       After hearing parties, I made the following orders:

(a)     Husband is to pay monthly maintenance of $235 for the Child with effect from August 2018. The maintenance accumulated from August 2018 to January 2019 shall be paid in monthly instalments of $120 for 11 months and $90 on the 12th month.

(b)     In addition, Husband shall pay:-

a.       Half of the Child’s medical expenses with effect from August 2018. The Husband is to reimburse his share of the Child’s medical expenses within 7 days of receipt of the Child’s medical invoice/receipt.

b.       Half of the Child’s nett childcare fees (after deduction of any government subsidy or financial assistance).

(c)     The Husband is also to pay for the following household expenses:

a.       Half of the mortgage instalment for the matrimonial flat directly to HDB

b.       Half of the Service and Conservancy charges for the matrimonial flat directly to Town Council

c.       100% of the utility bills for the matrimonial flat with effect from June 2018 unless the Wife and Child moves into the matrimonial flat and the Husband moves out, whereupon the Husband shall then pay an additional $20 as monthly maintenance for the Child. Husband is to reimburse the Wife for the utility bills that have been paid by her from June 2018 to the date of the Order;

d.       Half of the instalment plans for the electrical appliances and bed for the matrimonial flat.

## Appeal

4       The Wife has appealed against the entire order.

## Parties’ Particulars

5       The Wife is 30 years old and was originally working as a conference producer until September 2018. She explained she had to resign from her job as she was taking too much leave from her job due to her Child’s illness, having to attend Court cases and consulting lawyers in order to prepare for her Court cases. She used to earn a take home salary of more than $2,000. Mid-way during the hearing, the Wife found part-time employment, enabling her to draw an income of more than $1,000 per month.

6       The Husband is 32 years old and has his own interior design company. However, he claimed that his company is on the brink of closing down due to suits that were filed in Court by suppliers and clients who backed out of contracts due to the Wife’s messages on the Facebook account which caused damage to his and his company’s reputation. At the end of the trial, he claimed to be seeking alternative employment and may be able to secure a monthly income of $1,200.

## Wife’s Claim

7       The Wife claimed a monthly maintenance amount of $5,600 (which would be 100% of the alleged expenses for herself and the Child). In addition, she also claimed a lump sum amount for various other claims.

## Husband’s offer

8       The Husband claimed that the Wife has higher earning capacity than him and is self-sufficient. He also states that due to his current financial and employment status, he can only afford to contribute half of the Child’s medical expenses.

## Assessment of the Wife’s Earning Capacity

9       The Wife admitted that she had resigned from her employment and explained that her employers had spoken to her about her frequent leaves of absence from work due to her attending to the multiple Court applications as well as due to the child falling ill. Whilst I accept that she might have exhausted the goodwill of her employers and therefore resigned, I could not accept her explanation that she could not be gainfully employed on a full time basis.

10     By the time of the hearings before me, the parties’ other Court applications had been fully heard. These were the personal protection order and domestic exclusion order applications. The issue of whether a domestic exclusion order was to be granted had been reserved for decision. There was no need for parties to spend time preparing Court documents. There would be no other Court attendance except for the maintenance trial itself before me as well as possibly a hearing for decision on the domestic exclusion order. In any event, the fact that parties have ongoing litigation would not justify parties remaining unemployed just to deal with a Court case.

11     The Child continues to be enrolled in infant care during the day as was the arrangement when the Wife was employed. The Wife spoke of chores she had to do at the shelter and food she had to prepare for the Child. I was of the view these were not sufficient reasons to justify any inability to return to full time employment.

12     It was not disputed that the Wife has a higher education qualification compared to the Husband. At her previous employment, she admitted receiving income of about $3,300. Although she has found a part-time job earning her a take home income of about $1,000, I did not consider this to be a fair figure to base the maintenance order on. I based my decision on her previous income of $3,300 as there was no reason provided to conclude she cannot draw such an income anymore.

## Assessment of the Husband’s earning capacity

13     The Husband was working in his own interior design company during the marriage. He claimed the Wife caused the collapse of his company by ruining his reputation publicly on Facebook. The Wife denied causing this and claimed that he had deliberately gone into debt to avoid maintenance, as threatened by him.

14     Although there was evidence that the Husband did threaten the Wife to ensure she would not receive any maintenance, I did not believe that he deliberately caused the problems his company faced to defeat the Wife’s maintenance claim. There was evidence of civil claims made by third parties and judgments being entered against the Husband. The Wife herself, also attempted to make out a case that the Husband owed many debts because he could not run his business properly[^1]. Therefore, I did not find the decline of the Husband’s business to be self-induced.

15     The Husband claimed he had been searching for alternative employment and may potentially have a job with an income of $1,200 in pet retail. I found this to be below his income capacity. His experience has been in the construction industry prior to setting out his renovation company. He was previously a project manager in interior design and construction companies. He has not shown any evidence of his claim that he was unable to find a job back in either industry. It appears that he may not have been conscientiously looking for job to meet his income potential as he is getting ready to take custody of their daughter[^2].

16     The Wife believed the Husband has another source of income from his TV acting jobs. From the evidence before me, whilst the Husband may have had some ad hoc jobs as an extra for local TV shows, it is a stretch to suggest he has any real and regular income as an actor. Whilst he may have appeared in shows with well-known experienced local celebrities, it does not make him one. Therefore, I did not find any worthwhile income to be regarded for the purposes of determining monthly income from such job(s).

17     Without any other evidence before me, I drew an inference that the Husband has the income capacity that is about equal to the Wife’s. This is in line with their private arrangement during the marriage where they were to share family expenses equally.

## Reasonable expenses of Wife and Child

18     I considered the various reasonable expenses of the Wife and Child:

## Reasons for Child’s Maintenance Order

19     In view of the financial capacity of both parents, I decided to apportion the Child’s reasonable expenses equally between parties. For medical expenses which varies monthly, I ordered the Husband to bear half of the actual amount upon production of receipts by the Wife.

20     For childcare, the child currently receives financial assistance such that there is no payment due from the parents. However, it is unlikely that such financial assistance will be permanent and therefore I provided for the situation where the financial assistance ceases, parties shall then share half of such cost. Once this becomes payable, this will constitute a large amount from each party, i.e. $682.50 per parent.

21     After catering for the above 2 expenses, I then ordered the Husband to pay $235 as child maintenance to the Wife, being half of other reasonable expenses.

## Reasons for Wife’s Maintenance Order

22     The monthly instalment of the matrimonial flat was $850 per month and this constituted a substantial portion of the maintenance claim the Wife sought. The Wife proved that she had been paying for the full instalment and although the Husband gave a very weak excuse that he did not pay because the Wife took away the HDB letters regarding arrears and he did not know the instalment amount, he agreed to pay the monthly instalment of the flat during the trial. I ordered him to bear half since he is a co-owner. This is the similar position regarding the service and conservancy fee of the matrimonial flat. Once the Wife regains full employment, I expect her to be able to pay her half share of the monthly instalment through her CPF account.

23     I ordered reimbursement by the Husband for the utility bills which he incurred solely after she filed her application for maintenance.

24     There were 2 instalment plans that the Wife was paying for with regard to their bed and electrical appliances, such as fans, cooker, kettle, washing machine and fridge. In view of the ongoing monthly expense which the Wife is paying, I ordered the Husband to share half of this until the instalment plan is fully paid up.

25     After providing for the Husband to pay his share of the matrimonial flat, service and conservancy fees, utility bills, as well as instalment plans for their household furnishings, I considered the Wife able to provide for her own expenses (including her share of the Child’s expenses) out of the full-time employment income she should be able to secure. In the meantime, prior to her securing such full-time employment, she has secured part time employment with a nett income of more than $1000[^4]. I would expect it reasonable for her expenses to be scaled down in the meantime (e.g clothing, transport and outing expenses) that would enable her to continue to support herself. Whilst she is still living at the shelter, she will not be incurring certain expenses (e.g utility expenses).

26     The Wife had filed her claim for maintenance for her Husband to pay all her alleged expenses when she was unemployed. Although she had given reasons for it, she had resigned from her job and was not terminated from employment. I also noted that she did not reveal her bank accounts and the savings she had in order for a full consideration of her financial resources required under s69(4)(b) of the Women’s Charter. This may have been due to the fact that she did not want the Husband to gain knowledge of her financial affairs. Without this information, I therefore did not order the Husband to bear all the expenses of the Wife and the Child during the period she was unemployed although I did backdate the order for maintenance to the month she had filed for maintenance.

## Other Claims

27     The Wife also sought the following lump sum amounts:

a)     Home furnishing estimated at $4,800;

b)     Renovation works of $15,000;

c)     Annual purchase of handphone for $750; and

d)     Claim for damaged breast pump, laptop and handphones for $5,400.

28     The Wife exhibited 4 receipts totalling $2,911.11 comprising purchases of furniture and installation of curtains to support her claim for home furnishing. These were incurred around April to May 2018. There was no other evidence to support the figure of $4,800. I did not make any order on this claim. It is likely that he did not reimburse her any part of these purchases as he had declared on 25 March 2018 that he will “withdraw from house renovation and accessories”[^5]. His last contribution to her was on 4 April 2018, which was before these purchases were made. Unlike the ongoing instalment plans, these purchases were fully paid for in the past. The Wife was in essence, seeking reimbursement for her purchases. However, as both parties were unrepresented, there were no submissions before me relating to the reasonableness of the expense as well as whether this should fall within a maintenance claim or be considered (as it is usually done) as the Wife’s contribution towards the family. I declined to make any order on this as I felt this would be better dealt with as the Wife’s indirect financial contribution in any asset division issue.

29     As for renovation claim of $15,000, this was a projected expense that the Wife believes she needs to incur in order to make the matrimonial flat suitable for both the child and her to reside in. There was no quotation attached in support of her claim. Some of her claim did not seem necessary, e.g. clothes wardrobe (her previous claim under home furnishing already showed there was a wardrobe purchased). In any event, without a proper quotation showing the breakdown of the cost for each job she claims is necessary, I did not make an order on this.

30     As for the Wife’s claim for an annual purchase of handphone costing $750, although she had claimed this under a lump sum payment, on the stand she had clarified that she wanted to claim this as a yearly figure[^6]. If this is something she feels is a reasonable standard of living for her, then she can provide this for herself.

31     The Wife also claimed $5,400 being the cost of items which the Husband damaged, i.e. a laptop, a breast pump and 2 handphones. I believe the Wife’s account that the Husband did damage the items[^7], however a maintenance claim should not be used for a party to recover damages or compensation. I made no order on this.

## Conclusion

32     In this case, both parties are facing a dip in their careers but I expect them to come out of this relatively quickly if they put their minds to it. It is fortunate that for the time being, the most expensive expense of the Child, which is her infant care, is fully subsidized when both parties are facing financial constraints. It is important that the Child receives adequate financial support from both her parents nonetheless, which I sought to restore through the maintenance order. This, and each party’s financial independence can be quickly achieved when they are gainfully employed.
