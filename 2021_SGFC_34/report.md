Family Law – Maintenance – Wife

5 April 2021

### District Judge Goh Kiat Yi:

## Introduction

1       The present case concerns the ancillary matters following the dissolution of the marriage between the Plaintiff Husband (“the husband”) and the Defendant Wife (“the wife”). The only issues in dispute were the division of matrimonial assets and maintenance. I heard parties on 10 December 2020 and delivered my decision on 22 December 2020 with reasons given.

2       In summary, I ordered the matrimonial assets be divided 58% to 42% in favour of the husband. The husband was also ordered to pay wife maintenance fixed at $6,000 per month for a period of 24 months with effect 1 January 2021 and the sum shall be reduced to $4,000 per month payable for a further 36 months.

3       The wife has appealed only against my order on wife maintenance.

## Background facts

### The family

4       Parties were married in Sweden on 21 May 1994. They have 3 children to the marriage, namely, \[Child 1\], \[Child 2\], and \[Child 3\]. They are 25, 23 and 21 years old respectively and are all adults by the time of the ancillary hearing.

5       The husband is 54 years old and is a Senior Consultant at the xxx Hospital.

6       The mother is 56 years old and is a sole proprietor of a small home business dealing in the manufacture and sale of hand-made batik cloth.

7       The family moved to Singapore sometime in late 2008 and have been living here since. The marriage broke down sometime in 2017 and parties started living apart since June 2018. The husband commenced divorce proceedings in July 2018, and the interim judgment was granted on an uncontested basis on 26 December 2018 on both the husband’s claim and wife’s counterclaim.

8       This was a marriage of around 24.5 years with 3 adult children.

## Documents filed in the proceedings

9       For ease of reference, I set out the documents that have been filed by parties in the following table:

## Parties’ cases

10     The sole issue on appeal is the issue of wife maintenance.

11     The husband submits that no wife maintenance should be ordered. He argues that the wife has not provided full and frank disclosure of her business documents should be treated as someone who is in a position to command a substantial income.[^1] He further submits that if the court is minded to order maintenance, a reasonable sum would be $2,000 per month and for a period of 3 years paid out as a lump sum for a clean break.[^2]

12     The wife submits that the husband should pay monthly maintenance of $12,000 and if the court is minded to fix a period for wife maintenance, the multiplier should be 18.5 years.[^3] The wife submits that the husband earns a sizeable income and has no issues paying the maintenance. Further she submits that there are no substantial assets to be divide, the husband is younger than her while at age 56 she will not be able to return to the workforce, and his qualifications as a surgeon would hold him in good stead.[^4]

## The law on maintenance for a former spouse

13     The Court of Appeal in _ATE v ATD_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGCA 2</span> (“ATE”) has set out the key principles on the issue of maintenance of a former spouse. The Court noted citing an earlier decision in _Foo Ah Yan v Chiam Heng Chow_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 2 SLR 506</span>) that the overarching principle embodied in s 114(2) is that of financial preservation, which requires the wife to be maintained at a standard that is, to a reasonable extent, commensurate with the standard of living she had enjoyed during the marriage, also to be applied in a “commonsense holistic manner that takes into account the new realities that flow from the breakdown of marriage”.[^5]

14     The Court of Appeal also accepted the proposition that the power to order maintenance is supplementary to the power to order division of matrimonial assets and courts regularly take into account each party’s share of the matrimonial assets when assessing the appropriate quantum of maintenance to be ordered. Finally, the award of maintenance for a former wife takes into account the fact that the former wife ought to try to regain self-sufficiency and that an order of maintenance is not intended to create life-long dependency by the former wife on the former husband.[^6]

## My findings on wife maintenance

### Whether a maintenance order should be made

15     I agreed with the wife that maintenance should be ordered as the wife was primarily supported by the husband throughout the marriage, she being the primary caregiver of the children. It is the husband’s own position that her businesses were also not profitable. I did not accept the husband’s contention that her social media postings relating to her present business would indicate a good income earning capacity. The wife is also only schooled till secondary education and it is difficult for her to earn a substantial income from full time employment. The wife is also 56 years old is not young.

16     It is also the husband’s case that the parties did not accumulate much assets throughout the marriage, I thus did not think that the division would have given her a surplus share of the assets such that no maintenance to be awarded at all. Looking at the pool of assets of around $1.19 million, only the Aviva investment Insurance worth $322,867 and the and monies in their bank accounts of around $269,275 are liquid assets with the remaining substantially in CPF or pension monies.

17     I concluded that the wife was entitled to further wife maintenance and the only real issue pertains to the amount.

### The amount of maintenance

#### The wife’s income

18     The wife is presently a sole proprietor of a small business known as xxx Retail (“UDR”) which deals with the manufacture and sale of hand-made batik cloth.[^7] I accept the wife’s evidence that the business is has not been doing well in the past 3 years since 2017[^8] and this is borne out by the tax documents submitted. Given the nature of the business, being primarily retail of cloth, I accepted the wife’s submission of continuing difficulty in 2020 given the Covid-19 pandemic.[^9]

19     I therefore found that the wife’s present income would be nominal.

#### The wife’s reasonable expenses

20     I next considered the wife’s reasonable expenses with my findings set out in the following table.

21     I thus assessed the wife’s total expenses at $6,000 and note this is not far off the figure of $6,574.81 she had originally set out in her first affidavit.[^13]

#### The husband’s income

22     The husband’s income over a four-year period based on his IRAS notice of assessment (after deducting tax and CPF contributions) is as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="49.92%"> <col width="50.08%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Year of assessment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Monthly income (net tax and CPF deductions)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2016</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">45,523</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2017</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">46,743</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2018</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">43,589</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2020</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">39,616</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

23     I considered that the husband earned less in the more recent 2 years and assessed his monthly take home income at $42,000, a conservative estimate slightly lower than the average over the 4 years.

#### The husband’s expenses

24     The husband submits that his total expenses is around $40,000.[^14] I find the amount to be significantly excessive especially with his claims on food, travel, entertainment, clothing and shoes.[^15] I also note that such an expense list include what he claims to be presently paying already for the wife which can be taking out for the assessment of the amount he ought to pay moving forward.

25     It was unnecessary to undertake a minute assessment of his expenses as his income would be more than sufficient to support the wife’s assessed expenses of $6,000 fully. Furthermore, he would also receive 58% from the $1.19 million asset pool.

#### Maintenance to be paid

26     From the foregoing, I was of the view that a periodic payment of maintenance would be appropriate in the instant case as I noted earlier that parties do not have substantial liquid assets for a lump sum to be awarded. There is also unlikely to be default in payments given the husband’s positive financial circumstances.

27     The husband submitted that the quantum should be a sum of $2,000 for a period of 3 years but counsel rightly conceded that he had no authority for such a proposition which is in any event insufficient. At the same time, I considered that it was necessary to fix an end date for the maintenance as the wife should also seek to regain self-sufficiency as maintenance is not intended to create a lifelong dependency.

28     Bearing in mind my assessment of her reasonable expenses to be $6,000, I was of the view that the husband should pay her maintenance of $6,000 for the next 2 years with the amount thereafter reduced to $4,000 for a further period of 3 years.

29     This will give the wife sufficient time to find gainful employment or work on her business. I note that whilst she is 56, her children have all attained the age of majority and will be substantially supported by the husband.[^16] The wife has also been running home businesses since parties were back in Europe with a store open selling clothes back in 2000 to 2006. Since parties moved to Singapore in 2009, she resumed her business in 2014 with some measure of success at least prior to 2017 which by her own account had generated modest income.[^17] Although these businesses were small businesses, I found that the wife is industrious in this regard and it goes to show that she can regain self-sufficiency if she endeavours to. This is especially since the children are now adults and she would no longer have to devote her time to caregiving as before. I have also ordered the decrease in maintenance to be staggered to give her more breathing space.

30     In arriving at my decision, I also considered that an order for maintenance of a former wife is supplementary to the division of matrimonial assets. The wife will receive 42% of the matrimonial pool which would amount to around $500,000. In addition, she would also be entitled to a settlement sum of around $82,000[^18] arising from litigation relating to a property previously owed by parties which I excluded from the matrimonial pool but took into account for the purposes of assessing her financial means. The total amount of maintenance payable by the husband would be a further $288,000. This would in my view be fair to even out the financial inequities suffered by the wife from undertaking the primary caregiving role for a 24.5-year marriage.

31     I have observed earlier that the husband should have no issues paying wife maintenance. He is at the peak of his career drawing a substantial income. There is no evidence that he will slow down. He is also younger than the wife. He will be able to pay the ordered amount whether from his income or from his share of the matrimonial pool whether with the liquid assets or when the illiquid assets are realized.

#### Backdated maintenance

32     Finally, the wife had made a claim for backdated maintenance in her submissions.[^19] I declined to backdate the maintenance order as the issue was raised belatedly and never mentioned in any of her affidavits. This is important as the husband would not have sufficient opportunity to respond to such a claim, for instance, by addressing what he has continued to pay for the wife and the children in the relevant period. In this particular case, it is also not disputed that the husband has been paying a part of the wife’s expenses as well as substantially most of the children’s expenses in this time.

## Conclusion

33     For the foregoing reasons, I ordered the husband to pay the wife maintenance of $6,000 a month for a period of 24 months with effect 1 January 2021. Thereafter the amount shall be decreased to $4,000 per month, payable for a further period of 36 months.

34     As neither party fully succeeded on either the issue of division or maintenance, I made no orders as to costs.
