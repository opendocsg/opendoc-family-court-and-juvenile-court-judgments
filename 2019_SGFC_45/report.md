Variation of Maintenance – Material Change in circumstances

25 April 2019

### District Judge Wendy Yu:

## Introduction

1       The parties were married on xxx 2008 and they have 2 sons, (“K1”) born on xxx 2008 (currently 9 years old) and (“K2”), born on xxx 2011 (currently 7 years old). The Defendant was 36 years old at the time of the hearing and is working as a financial adviser[^1]. The Plaintiff is 36 years old and a Senior Executive with an insurance company[^2]. Divorce proceedings were commenced after a 7-year marriage and ancillary orders were made by District Judge Suzanne Chin (“DJ Chin”) on 19 May 2017. The parties share joint custody of both children, while the Plaintiff has care and control of both of them, with access to the Defendant.

2       On the issue of maintenance for the children, DJ Chin had decided that the reasonable expenses for K1 was $1,200, and $1500 for K2. Taking into consideration the salaries and earning capacities of both parties, DJ Chin had considered that it would be fair for the Defendant to bear 60% of the children’s expenses with the Plaintiff paying for 40%[^3]. DJ Chin had then determined that the Defendant shall pay to the Plaintiff a sum of $1,620 ($720 for the K1 and $900 for K2).

3       The relationship between parties remain very acrimonious and there were multiple applications filed by both parties since the ancillary orders, including various discovery applications and an application for leave to insert penal notice to court order. Both parties were not represented at these hearings, which were heard on three separate hearings on 8 January 2019, 1 February 2019 and 11 February 2019. I had dealt with three applications before me together, namely SUM 1731/2018, which is the Defendant’s application for a downward variation of maintenance, SUM 1956/2018 which is the Plaintiff’s application for upward variation of maintenance, and MSS 2932/2018 which is an application by the Plaintiff for enforcement of the outstanding arrears, as the issues were related. The Defendant’s appeal was only against my decision for SUM 1731/2018 and so I will only provide my decision for this matter.

#### Application FC/SUM 1731/2018

4       On 21 May 2018, the Defendant filed an application for a downward variation “to reduce children maintenance of $1620 under the Order of Court to an amount of $700 a month.”

5       On 6 June 2018, the Plaintiff filed an application for an upward variation to increase the maintenance from $1,620 to $2,000. I had dismissed the Plaintiff’s application for an upward variation, and as there was no appeal against this decision, I will not elaborate further on my decision to dismiss the Plaintiff’s application.

## Defendant’s Submissions

6       The Defendant had declared his gross income as $4,657.41 per month[^4], and that his income is based on commission. The Defendant has applied for a downward variation because he has been struggling to pay for maintenance and had to take up personal loans resulting his being heavily in debt[^5].

7       The Defendant has stated that K2 was in pre-school when the ancillary orders were made in 2015 but is now in primary school and so there is a significant reduction in school fees.[^6] Other reasons given for the Defendant’s application were that the experienced domestic helper employed by Plaintiff having been replaced and so the household expenses has been reduced, the Plaintiff’s salary having increased, and Plaintiff having a windfall after selling their matrimonial flat. The Defendant has also claimed that his health has deteriorated after being “assaulted” by the Plaintiff on 3 December 2014 and that he would “require long term treatment to reduce the swell and for the muscles to recover.”[^7]

8       The Defendant had highlighted that there was an error in his lawyer’s statement during the hearing before DJ Chin with regard to his position to pay $700 per child. His position at the hearing before me is that he should only be required to pay $700 for both children. However, there was no appeal against DJ Chin’s order back then. The Defendant’s position is that the expenses of both children should only be $1,400 and that the Defendant should only be paying half of such expenses[^8]. During the closing submissions, the Defendant has submitted that “the total child maintenance for both children is $746.68” and that “the Defendant is to pay 50% of this amount”.[^9]

## Plaintiff’s Submissions

9       The Plaintiff submits that since the ancillary order, maintenance was never enough for both children.[^10] The Plaintiff also added that the K1 was badly affected by the divorce and consequently, had to go for more therapy sessions[^11] and K1 needed a lot of tonics as he was born a premature baby. The Plaintiff also contended that the cost of employing a helper has increased[^12]. The Plaintiff had highlighted that the Defendant’s income is about $8,000 monthly[^13] (or about $6,147.00[^14] monthly), or a monthly average of $7,256.00 which was not disclosed until the Plaintiff’s request for discovery[^15]. Despite the Defendant’s claim of a decrease in income and struggling to keep up with maintenance for the children, the Plaintiff had pointed out that the Defendant has upgraded to a Mercedes car in July 2017, spending “a staggering” sum per month of $2,366.32 (loan, road tax, insurance, maintenance, petrol & cashcard) on the vehicle.[^16] While the Plaintiff acknowledged that she has since obtained a job with a higher salary, her current job does not pay her more on an annual basis as her previous job was on a 13th month pay scheme and her current job on a 12th month pay scheme[^17].

## Orders Made

10     I dismissed the Plaintiff’s application for upward variation, but had granted the Defendant’s application for a downward variation.

11     I made the following orders:

\-    The children’s maintenance of $1,620 payable by the Defendant under paragraph (e) of the Order of Court dated 5 April 2017 is reduced to the amount of $1,200 a month for both children, with effect from June 2018.

\-    I had also made orders for costs, for the Plaintiff to pay the Defendant costs of $200 (including disbursements) in total for both Summons 1731/2018 and Summons 1956/2018.

12     I had made the above costs orders as both parties did not seek legal representation at the hearings. Costs orders were discretionary in nature and I was of the view that such a cost order of $200 (including disbursements) was reasonable.

## Appeal

13     Despite my granting a reduction of maintenance, the Defendant was not satisfied with the extent of the reduction and has since appealed against the orders I have made as above. I will now give my reasons for my decision.

## The Law

14     Section 118 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353) provides:

_“The Court may at any time vary or rescind any subsisting order for maintenance, whether secured or unsecured, on the application of the person in whose favour or of the person against whom the order was made, or, in respect of secured maintenance, of the legal personal representatives of the latter, where it is satisfied that the order was based on any misrepresentation or mistake of fact or where there has been any material change in the circumstances.”_

## Material Change in circumstances

15     I had to determine if there were material change in circumstances which would warrant a variation in the maintenance sum. Amongst all the arguments canvassed by the Defendant for a downward variation, I am of the view that there have been two significant factors to be considered a material change, one being the increase in the Plaintiff’s salary, and the other, being the reduction of the children’s expenses, which warrants a downward variation. On the issue of the Defendant’s contention that he has a health condition, there is no evidence that this health condition has affected his earning capacity[^18].

#### Income of Both Parties

16     The Plaintiff’s salary at the ancillary hearing was $3,666.00[^19]. During the current proceedings, the Plaintiff conceded that her current salary is now $5,500 a month[^20].

17     The Defendant’s salary back at the ancillary stage was $5,625.00[^21], with DJ Chin noting that “(the Defendant) had in the past earned far more than these amounts”[^22]. The Defendant has stated that his current salary is a gross amount of $4,657.41[^23] and that his “income is based on commission”[^24]. The Defendant has stated during the hearing that his income “fluctuate from month to month” with “(s)ome months (the Defendant) can be making 2000 a month, some months (the Defendant) can be making 6,000 a month”.[^25] However, after various discovery applications filed by both parties, there was a letter from the xxx dated 24 December 2018 that showed that the Defendant’s commission earnings from 1 January 2018 to 30 June 2018 was $43,539.63[^26]. This meant that the Defendant’s average commission earnings monthly was in the region of $7,256.60, which would reflect on the Defendant’s earning capacity even if his income fluctuated from month to month.

18     There was sufficient evidence that the Defendant’s income is an average of $7,256.60 a month, while the Plaintiff’s income is $5,500 monthly as she has stated during the hearing. While the Plaintiff’s salary has increased since the ancillary hearing, the Defendant’s salary has also increased.

#### Decrease in expenses of the children

19     At the ancillary hearing, the Plaintiff had claimed that the expenses of the children inclusive of their portion of the household expenses amounted to $1,652.00 for K2, and $1,896.00 for the K1. DJ Chin, after taking into consideration the factors in S69(4) of the Women’s Charter, determined that the reasonable expenses back then for K1 would be $1,200 and for K2, $1,500[^27].

20     At the current proceedings, the Plaintiff has declared that the current expenses for the K1 to be $1,370, and $1,094.00[^28] for K2. K2 is currently in primary school, with less expenses than when he was in pre-school. This would be a material change which would warrant a reduction of maintenance payable by the Defendant.

### What is a reasonable sum for maintenance?

21     In setting out the expenses of the children, I would like to highlight Justice Debbie Ong’s views in **_UEB v UEC \[2018\] SGHCF 5_** at \[13\]

_“While it is a very useful practice to determine whether each item in the list of expenses submitted by the Wife is a reasonable one, one should not be overly mesmerised by the approach of reaching a maintenance sum only by totalling up every item of expense as if it were a legal requirement. The law provides that the court shall take into account various factors in deciding the maintenance award. The law does not require that every specific item of expense be proved by receipts or assessed on specific values, as if on a reimbursement exercise. More exceptional expenses though, such as certain medical needs and costs, ought to be supported by evidence. A child’s needs and expenses may also fluctuate from month to month; similarly; household expenses may fluctuate over time. Setting out regularly specific expenses nevertheless enables the other party and the court to assess broadly whether the expenses are reasonable.”_

Besides my having to take into account various factors in deciding the maintenance award, I have set out expenses of the children- what is reasonable as stated by the Plaintiff, what is the reasonable sum as stated by the Defendant, and the reasonable sum to be awarded by the Court:

22     I am of the view that a reasonable sum of maintenance for K1 should be $1,150, and $850 for K2, which adds up to $2,000 for both children.

### Apportionment of Maintenance of Children- Should it be equal share or 60%-40%?

23     The Defendant’s position during the current proceedings has been that both parents should bear the children’s expenses equally and that the Court should not adhere to DJ Chin’s apportionment of 60% to the Defendant and 40% to the Plaintiff.

24     In apportioning the share of maintenance payable by each parent, I bore in mind the _dicta_ of the Honourable Justice Kan Ting Chiu in **_TBC v TBD \[2015\] SGHC 130_** at \[27\] that “the starting point should be that parents bear the financial burden equally and one parent’s burden should not be decreased just because the other parent is wealthier, and one parent’s burden should not be increased just because the other parent is less well off.”

25     However, in the very recent Court of Appeal decision in **_BPC v BPB \[2019\] SGCA 3_**, the Husband in the case had appealed against the orders made regarding maintenance for the children. In particular, the Judge in the lower court had apportioned 75% of the expenses to the Husband, while the Wife bore 25% of the expenses. The Husband was of a view that he should only bear half of the children’s expenses because he argued that both parties have a joint and equal obligation to maintain their children under Section 68 of the Women’s Charter.

26     The Court of Appeal in dismissing this part of the appeal opined:

_“The Husband also submits that the Judge should have ordered the parties to each bear half of all expenses incurred for the Children because both parties have a joint and equal obligation to maintain their children under S68 of the Charter. We do not accept that s68 mandates such a result. Although parents do indeed share an equal responsibility for looking after their children, this ought not to necessarily translate into each parent bearing an equal share of the burden to provide maintenance for their children. This is because the extent of the duty to provide maintenance rests on a host of factors as enumerated by S114(1) of the Charter:_

(_a_)     _the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;_

(_b_)     _the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;_

(_c_)     _the standard of living enjoyed by the family before the breakdown of the marriage;_

(_d_)     _the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage;_

(_e_)     _any physical or mental disability of either of the parties to the marriage;_

(_f_)     _the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family; and_

(_g_)     _in the case of proceedings for divorce or nullity of marriage, the value to either of the parties to the marriage of any benefit (for example, a pension) which, by reason of the dissolution or annulment of the marriage that party will lose the chance of acquiring._

_It was therefore open to the Judge to consider other factors, including the relative circumstances of both parties, in making the maintenance orders.”_

27     I adopted the above approach of the Court of Appeal on this issue – that, besides the income of the parties, it was open to the Court to take into consideration the relative circumstances of both parties, including their earning capacity, financial resources as well as the property each currently possesses, including their financial needs. I was of the view that it was reasonable that the Defendant shoulder a 60% share of the children’s expenses, while the Plaintiff shoulders 40% of the expenses, after taking into consideration the relative circumstances of both parties. I did not see that there was any need to change the apportionment accorded by DJ Chin. Even though the Plaintiff had an increase in salary, the Defendant’s salary had also increased. The Defendant’s share of the monthly expenses of $2,000 would therefore be $1,200, while the Plaintiff’s share is $800.

28     One of the factors that the Court may take into consideration as enumerated in S114(1) of the Women’s Charter are the property, financial needs, obligations and responsibilities that each party has. The Defendant has stated that he has to take up multiple loans to sustain his monthly expenses, and that the Mercedes that he is currently driving is purchased by his father last year[^31] but the Defendant is the one paying for the monthly expenses of this vehicle with the loan taken under the Defendant’s name. The Defendant has explained that the “purposes of such expenses” is to help him “earn a decent income” and “to maintain the current income” that he is currently getting.[^32]

29     While I do agree that the Defendant will need a car in his line of business, it may not be necessary for him to maintain a higher-end vehicle like a Mercedes which cost at least $2,216.32[^33] per month to upkeep, especially when the Defendant has been “struggling” to keep up with maintenance payments for his young children and is “heavily in debt”[^34]. While the Defendant has declared that his salary is a gross sum of $4,657.41[^35], the Defendant has shown in his affidavit that he has been sustaining expenses of at least $8,481.70 each month[^36] even though according to the Defendant, he has not been able to keep up with his expected expenses in the region of $13,331.70 and that he has to take loans to maintain his expenses. One of the expenses that the Defendant has explained during the hearing that he has defaulted thus far is the monthly allowance of $1,000[^37] for his parents (even though the figure was only $300[^38] during the ancillary hearing before DJ Chin) as the Defendant was staying with his parents after the divorce. However, the Defendant has testified during the hearing that he no longer had to pay the parents $1,000 per month as allowance as he has since moved out and has now his own place to stay[^39]. The reduction of such an expense can be channelled to pay for the expenses of the children who are still growing up. It is certainly more needful for the Defendant to spend his income on his young children than in maintaining a high-end vehicle.

## Costs Orders

30     The Defendant had asked for a clarification of costs after my hearing, as he had pointed out that in one of the discovery applications (SUM 3155/2018) heard by AR Goh Kiat Yi (“AR Goh”) on 16 October 2018, AR Goh had granted a cost order of “Defendant’s cost in the cause” at the end of the discovery application, and so the Defendant had argued that he deserved to be awarded more costs that the sum that was currently awarded to him.

31     While costs usually follow the event, I also had to take into consideration the fact that the Defendant did not fully succeed in his application for a reduction in maintenance. In particular, the Defendant’s position was that the maintenance that he should be paying be reduced to only $700 for both children, while the amount I ordered the Defendant to pay was $1,200. The Defendant did not fully succeed in his application and he was in person at all the hearings. Such costs orders are discretionary so I am of the view that the sum of $200 (including disbursements) is a reasonable sum.
