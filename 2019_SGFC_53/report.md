Family Law – Ancillary matters – Division of matrimonial assets

Family Law – Ancillary matters – Maintenance

07 May 2019

### District Judge Azmin Jailani:

## Introduction

1       These proceedings relate to my determination of the ancillary matters between the Plaintiff (Wife) and the Defendant (Husband).

2       By way of brief background, parties were married on xx xxx 1987. After almost 31 years of marriage, interim judgment was granted on 19 June 2018. Interim judgment was granted on the basis of the Plaintiff’s claim pursuant to section 95(3)(b) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev. Ed) (“WC”).

3       There are two children to the marriage, and elder girl and a younger boy who, at the time of the hearing, were 30 years old and 23 years old respectively. As highlighted by the Plaintiff in her submissions, since both children have reached the age of majority, there were no custody issues or maintenance issues (at least vis-à-vis the Plaintiff and Defendant themselves) in connection with the children.

4       On that basis, the main ancillary matters in dispute relate to the division of parties’ sole matrimonial asset (i.e., the matrimonial home), the manner in which the asset was to be distributed between parties, and the Plaintiff’s claim for maintenance.

5       After hearing parties’ submissions and after considering the material before me, I essentially made the following orders, namely that:

(a)     the matrimonial asset be divided in the ratio of 55:45 in the Plaintiff’s favour;

(b)     the matrimonial asset be sold in the open market, with consequential orders on the manner and priority of distribution of the sale proceeds; and

(c)     that the Plaintiff be awarded lump sum maintenance of $24,000. This was after taking into consideration _both_ parties’ submission that it would be better for parties to have a “clean break” from the dispute, instead of there being any lingering order which may necessitate parties coming back to Court and being embroiled in future proceedings.

6       The full terms of my orders may be found at **Annex-A** below. I also provided brief grounds of my decision when parties attended before me on 25 January 2019.

7       Dissatisfied, and by way of HCF/DCA 14/2019, the Defendant appealed against the entirety of my decision. Against that backdrop, I now give the full grounds of my decision.

9       The other main document forming part of the record of these particular proceedings were the notes of evidence for the substantive hearing on 9 January 2019.[^1]

## Division of Matrimonial Asset

10     I first start with the issue of division.

11     In terms of identifying the asset pool to be divided, there was no dispute between parties that the _only_ asset liable for division would be the matrimonial home. This is evident in parties’ documents.

12     For completeness, I also note from the documents that parties had listed, as part of their personal assets, their respective bank accounts and CPF monies. Neither party sought to make a claim against the other for those assets.[^2] I saw no reason to depart from parties’ own agreed positions, and did not include those assets into the asset pool.

13     Turning back to the matrimonial home, there was also no dispute between parties that at the time of the hearing, the estimated value of the matrimonial home ranged between $320,000 to $340,000.[^3] There was also no dispute that there was still an outstanding mortgage loan of approximately $19,000.[^4] This amounted to an anticipated gross proceed of approximately $320,000 to $300,000. At the time of making my decision, I was inclined to take a more conservative approach and valued the anticipated proceeds at the lower end of the range (i.e., $300,000).

14     Whilst the Plaintiff was principally a home maker during the subsistence of the marriage,[^5] it was specifically worth noting that it was also not in dispute that _both_ parties had made _direct financial contributions_ towards the purchase of the matrimonial home. In this regard, it was not in dispute that:

(a)     the Plaintiff had contributed approximately 38% (i.e., approximately $66,000) towards the purchase price of the matrimonial home; and

(b)     the Defendant had contributed approximately 62% (i.e., approximately $109,000) towards the purchase price of the matrimonial home.

### Parties’ respective positions on division

15     Against that backdrop, parties’ respective positions on the eventual proportions of distribution is as follows:

16     With regard to the Defendant:

(a)     the Defendant contended that he had been making indirect financial contributions in terms of the payment of the family’s expenses, the utilities, and the conservancy charges.[^6] As regards indirect non-financial contributions, the Defendant argued that he had “maintained and cleaned the house”, performed “minor repairs”, and “look after the children and ensured they have proper food, clothing, and education”.[^7]

(b)     Curiously, and _without_ indicating the value of these indirect contributions and supporting calculations, the Defendant arrived at an ultimate uplifted ratio of 70:30 in his favour.

17     As regards the Plaintiff:

(a)     Her candid position was that given her status as a home maker during the subsistence of the marriage, there was not much to be said regarding her indirect financial contribution.[^8] That said, and for completeness, she did mention that she did work as a factory worker before the birth of the younger son, [^9] and did the occasional part time work when the children were in school[^10] to supplement the household income.

(b)     The Plaintiff also highlighted how she was requested by the Defendant to stay home and take care of the family when the 2nd child was born.[^11]

(c)     However, being the home make, her principal contention was that her indirect non-financial contributions “far surpass” the Defendant.[^12] In her evidence, the Plaintiff listed a fairly extensive narration of how she had taken care of the Defendant, the children, and the household.[^13] This included daily cleaning of the house, washing the family’s clothes, doing the grocery runs and preparing the family’s daily meals,[^14] and tending to the Defendant himself during the recovery period after he had suffered a heart attack.[^15]

(d)     More specifically, the Plaintiff contended that the Defendant did not provide any assistance to the general upkeep of the matrimonial home and the family’s welfare.[^16] In this regard, the Plaintiff highlighted the Defendant’s aggressive, patriarchal, and controlling attitude towards the Plaintiff and the family.[^17] This translated to the Plaintiff not only having to shoulder the entire burden of the domestic duties, but to also manage and pander to the Defendant’s wishes, lest the Plaintiff were to be the on receiving end of the Defendant’s verbal abuse.

(e)     On that basis, the Plaintiff asserted that her non-financial indirect contribution should be valued at 80:20 in her favour. This would result in an average ratio of 59:46 in the Plaintiff’s favour.[^18]

(f)     Not stopping there, the Plaintiff went further to contend that because of the Defendant’s behaviour, this was not a marriage where there was any equality in the partnership.[^19] On that basis, the Plaintiff sought to persuade this Court that parties’ direct contributions only be accorded 30% weightage, whilst indirect contributions be weighted heavier at 70%.

(g)     On the Plaintiff’s calculations,[^20] this would result in the ratio of 67.4 : 36.6 in the Plaintiff’s favour.

(h)     Finally, on account of the fact that the Plaintiff moved out of the matrimonial home sometime in April 2017, and thereby allowing the Defendant to have exclusive possession of the matrimonial home, the Plaintiff made a final upward adjustment to the Plaintiff’s proportion. This resulted in a final figure of 70:30 in the Plaintiff’s favour.

18     At this juncture, it would be useful to highlight, as I did here above and at the substantive hearing, that the Defendant provided _no evidence or cogent basis_ for the uplift in the division ratio of 38:62 (on the basis of direct contributions) to the eventual ratio of 30:70 in his favour. Purely as a matter of mathematics, the Defendant was putting forward a position whereby his indirect contributions would be approximately 22:78 in his favour. This would effectively indicate that not only was he the principal breadwinner, he was _also_ the principal homemaker.

19     At the hearing, the Defendant’s counsel, Mr Retnam, sought to challenge the Plaintiff’s contention for an uplift on account of her significant indirect contributions. In doing so, he sought to impress on me that both parties made equal indirect contributions.[^21] When I highlighted the mathematical impossibility of the Defendant’s position on the eventual ratio he was submitting even I were minded to accept his position on equal indirect contributions, Mr Retnam candidly submitted that the eventual ratio he was putting forward was driven primarily by the Defendant’s instructions.

20     I had no reason to question this submission, and given my earlier observation as to a clear lack of substantiation by the Defendant, I also had no hesitation in rejecting the Defendant’s position.

21     The corollary of my rejection of the Defendant’s position was whether I ought to accept the Plaintiff’s position in its totality.

### Parties’ approach in dealing with the ratio of division

22     I would pause here and note that in making their respective submissions on the eventual ratio of division, both parties were essentially adopting the approach stated in _ANJ v ANK_ (_“ANJ”_) (the “ANJ Approach”). That said, it was also well-established in the later decision of _TNL v TNK_ (_“TNL_”) that the ANJ Approach was not suitable for _long single-income marriages_. In those situations, the Court of Appeal in _TNL_ (at \[48\]) endorsed the approach of inclining towards equal division.

23     In her written submissions[^22], the Plaintiff acknowledged, for all intents and purposes, that the marriage was effectively a long single-income marriage. This was despite her position, which was not substantively opposed by the Defendant, that the Plaintiff was working in the earlier part of the marriage (before the 2nd child was born), and did some part time work to supplement the household income.

24     Instead, the Plaintiff’s counsel, Ms Shone’s, principal point of distinction was that the present case was _not_ a case where the Plaintiff, despite being the principal homemaker, did not make any weighty direct contribution towards the acquisition of the matrimonial asset. In this regard, given that the Plaintiff had undisputedly contributed a not insignificant 38% towards the purchase of the matrimonial property, the ANJ Approach should apply. This was perhaps to give proper effect to the different forms of efforts made by both parties (particularly the Plaintiff).

25     In his written submissions, the Defendant made _no submissions_ on why the approach in _TNL ought not_ to apply. Indeed, a review of the Defendant’s documents was that he was content to adopt the ANJ Approach, with the hope of obtaining an uplift from his direct contributions. It was only when faced with the apparent unsustainability of his position (as I had highlighted at \[18\] and \[19\] above) at the hearing where Mr Retnam sought to change his position and submit that _TNL_ would be a more appropriate approach.

26     After considering parties’ submissions at the relevant time, I was inclined to adopt the ANJ Approach in arriving at the final ratio of distribution. While I took into consideration the manner in which Parties’ themselves conducted their respective cases, that was not conclusively determinative of my decision.

27     In _TNL_ and the subsequent decisions which applied the principal stated therein (see, for instance, _UMU v UMT_ (and the first instance decision in _UMT v UMU_ ); _UKA v UKB_ ; and _UTS v UTT_ ) what may be discerned from those decisions was that the homemaker spouse did not have the kind of _direct contributions_ as the Plaintiff in the present case.[^23] In my view, adopting the ANJ Approach in those cases would amplify the limits of the said approach (as highlighted in _TNL_ at \[42\] to \[45\]).

28     However, this would not be so in the present case.

29     In the present case, it was not in dispute that the Plaintiff contributed to almost 40% of the purchase of the matrimonial home. This was not a case where the homemaker spouse would be placed at a disadvantage on Step 1 of the ANJ Approach. While the Plaintiff accepts that her indirect financial contribution was lacking vis-à-vis the Defendant, I was of the view that adopting the ANJ Approach would not place the Plaintiff in a position where, as cautioned in _TNL_, would place her in a situation where she was “doubly (and severely) disadvantaged” (_TNL_ at \[44\]).

30     Whilst the practical effect of my decision may be insignificant (based on my final calculations below), I was of the view that given the specific circumstances of the present case, the ANJ Approach would not have placed the Plaintiff in a more disadvantageous situation as compared to the approach in _TNL_. Put another way, it was not necessary, in the present circumstances, for me to immediately adopt the _TNL_ approach over the ANJ Approach.

### The eventual ratio of division

31     On that basis, and on Step 1 of the ANJ Approach, there was no dispute that that ratio would be 38:62 in the Defendant’s favour.

32     As regards Step 2, I accepted the Plaintiff’s submission that relative to the Defendant, she had little to account for in terms of her indirect financial contributions. As regards indirect non-financial contributions, I was inclined to accept the Plaintiff’s submission that relative to the Defendant, she had clearly done more to ensure the general upkeep of the matrimonial home and the family. The Plaintiff was clearly the person who was tasked, and did execute, the day-to-day running of the household and the management of the children.

33     That said, I was not inclined to value the Plaintiff’s indirect contributions at the value of her submissions. At 80:20 in favour of the Plaintiff, that figure would, in my view, not give sufficient recognition to the Defendant’s contributions. After assessing the evidence, I was more inclined to make a modest adjustment of 70:30 in the Plaintiff’s favour.

34     On that basis, the average ratio would be as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="54.66%"> <col width="23.2%"> <col width="22.14%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Plaintiff</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Defendant</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Step 1: Direct contribution</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">38</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">62</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Step 2: Indirect contribution</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">70</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">30</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Average ratio</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">55</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">45</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

35     The last issue I had to consider was whether to ‘shift’ the ratios. In _ANJ_ (at \[27\]), the Court of Appeal highlighted three (non-exhaustive) broad categories for the court’s consideration when adjusting the weight of parties’ contributions.

36     Two categories raised in _ANJ_ (at \[27(a)\] and \[27(c)\]) essentially dealt with the uplifting of indirect contributions, particularly those of the homemaker spouse in a long marriage. In the present case, and notwithstanding the fact that it was a long marriage and that the Plaintiff was the homemaker spouse, I was not inclined to make any further adjustments towards the weight of parties’ indirect contributions. As I highlighted earlier, the present case was slightly unique insofar as the Plaintiff had made a not insignificant direct contribution towards the matrimonial home. To my mind, both parties had given their effort to the partnership, and that proper and full credit should be given towards the proportions of their efforts. Making further adjustments to parties’ indirect contributions, in the present case, would, in my judgment, unnecessarily uplift/devalue the extent of their efforts.

37     Whilst I noted the Plaintiff’s submission of the Defendant’s character and how he had been treating the Plaintiff,[^24] I was not inclined to find that this marriage was so skewed such that their respective efforts in the partnership was not equal. While I was inclined to accept that the Defendant’s behaviour in treating the Plaintiff was unsustainable for the marriage to persist, it was, to my mind, a completely different proposition to say that whatever the Defendant did ought to be given less credence.

38     For those reasons, I was of the view that a reasonable ratio of division would be 55:45 in the Plaintiff’s favour.

## Maintenance

39     The next issue I would touch on would be the Plaintiff’s maintenance.

40     As I mentioned earlier, both Ms Shone and Mr Retnam were in agreement that instead of leaving a continuing order of maintenance, it might be better for both parties to have a clean break from each other.[^25] To effect this clean break, and given that the only meaningful asset was the matrimonial home, Mr Retnam suggested that no order for maintenance be made, and in lieu of that, a modest uplift of the eventual ratio I had arrived at.

41     Whilst making that submission, Mr Retnam did not propose what would constitute a modest uplift. Mr Retnam’s only submission was that the uplift should not amount to the ratio proposed by Ms Shone.

42     After considering the matter, I was of the view that a more principled approach would be to award the Plaintiff a fix amount as lump sum maintenance, as opposed to making an arbitrary increase in the ratios of division I had calculated earlier.

43     On that basis, I first determined the reasonable sum of maintenance. Briefly, the Defendant’s proposal was $100 per month, whereas the Plaintiff’s position was $600 per month. The Plaintiff derived her figure based on what the Defendant used to give her for the household expenses.[^26] I would also highlight that the Plaintiff herself acknowledged that sometime in 2013, the Defendant reduced this amount to $400 on the basis that the 1st child was contributing to the household expenses.

44     After reviewing parties’ evidence, I found the Plaintiff’s position unsustainable, especially given the Defendant’s income as a taxi driver[^27]. I also note that the Defendant himself had a fair amount of expenses in connection with his existing medical conditions. Even at the hearing, Ms Shone was not able to sustain her client’s position for such a high amount of maintenance.

45     In considering the matter, I was of the view that a modest adjustment of $200 per month was reasonable. I was also mindful of the fact that the net effect of making this order was that the Plaintiff would eventually obtain a higher proportion of the proceeds from the sale of the matrimonial home. When taken in its totality, the sums which the Plaintiff would eventually receive was sufficient in the present circumstances.

46     After determining the monthly sum, the next issue for my determination was the suitable multiplier. In this regard, I note the formula highlighted in _Law and Practice of Family Law in Singapore_ (Foo Siew Fong gen ed)(Sweet & Maxwell Asia 2016)(_“Law and Practice”_) (at \[4.3.20\]):

**Multiplier = \[(Y + Z) ÷\] – X**

X: Payee’s present age.

Y: Average age expectancy of the payee.

Z: Usual retirement age of the payer.

47     On the basis that the Plaintiff (as the payee) was 53 at the time of my decision, that the average life expectancy of the female is 85[^28], and that the retirement age of the Defendant would be 62, the formulaic multiplier would be as follows:

**\[(85 + 62) ÷\] – 53 = 20.5 ≈ 21 years**

48     While that was the multiplier derived by the formula, it was also noted in _Law and Practice_ (at \[4.3.19\], in referring to the decision of _Foo Ah Yan v Chiam Heng Chow_ ) that the court will have to take into consideration a variety of factors in determining the appropriate multiplier. This would include, amongst other things, the parties’ state of health and the payee’s financial resources.

49     After considering the matter, including the Defendant’s health condition, the factors I mentioned earlier (see \[44\] above), and the fact that the Plaintiff had already moved out of the matrimonial home, I was of the view that a multiplier of 10 years was more suitable in the circumstances. On that basis, the amount of lump maintenance to be awarded to the Plaintiff would be $24,000 (i.e., $200 x 12months x 10).

50     In ensuring the subsistence of this maintenance sum, my orders also provided that the disbursement of the maintenance sum be prioritised over other disbursements (i.e., CPF refunds).

## Disbursement of the divided sale proceeds

51     The final issue for determination would be the manner in which the proceeds from the sale of the matrimonial home were to be disbursed to parties. More specifically, whether the ratio of the division ought to be effected towards the proceeds _before or after_ CPF refunds had been made.

52     To put things into perspective, on the ratios I had determined earlier, on a sale price of $320,000 (i.e., net proceed of $300,000 after deducting the housing loan), and after putting aside the lump sum maintenance, the Plaintiff and Defendant would expect to receive approximately $151,800 and $124,200 respectively.

53     That said, it was not in dispute from parties’ documents that the following CPF refunds (including interest) would have to be made:

(a)     Plaintiff – approximately $103,000.[^29]

(b)     Defendant – approximately $166,000.[^30]

54     If division took place _before_ CPF refunds, that would mean that there would be a shortfall in the Defendant’s CPF account. If division took place _after_ CPF refunds, the Plaintiff would, on its face, receive less that the allocated sum in light of the Defendant’s larger CPF refund.

55     Needless to say, both parties took diametrically opposite positions on this issue. The Defendant took the position that division should only take place on the remaining proceeds after CPF refunds had been made. The Plaintiff took the opposite view.

56     After considering the matter, it was perhaps inevitable that a CPF refund _would first have to be effected_ on the proceeds. First, at the time of making my decision, the Plaintiff was under 55 years old. I accepted Ms Shone’s submission that any order that did not first address the CPF refunds would result in parties having difficulties with the CPF Board. Second, I also noted that on the Defendant’s own documents, any scenario which did not envisage a refund first taking place would also be met with problems given the amount in his retirement account.[^31] For those reasons, as a matter of practicality, it was necessary for CPF refunds to take place as a matter of priority

57     Notwithstanding these issues, I did not consider the Plaintiff to be in a worse off position. This was especially so given that the Court was able to make the appropriate transfer orders from the Defendant’s CPF account to the Plaintiff’s CPF account. To ensure the integrity of the ratio, I made the necessary transfer orders from the Defendant’s CPF account to the Plaintiff’s CPF account. I would pause here and highlight that the transfer orders, whilst ensuring the integrity of the ratios I had determined, would have little practical effect to the Defendant given that he has reached the age where he is already able to access his CPF monies.

58     To conclude, I have stated at the outset of this decision that the calculations of the CPF transfers were premised on a sale price of $320,000 for the matrimonial home. Given that this is not a foregone conclusion, I also incorporated in my orders for a proration of these values depending on the actual sale price of the matrimonial home. For the avoidance of doubt, the lump sum maintenance _would not_ be affected by the fluctuation of the sale price.

## Conclusion

59     Lastly, given that both the Plaintiff and Defendant were legally aided, I did not make any orders as to costs.

60     I would like to thank both Ms Shone and Mr Retnam for their submissions and assistance during the course of the proceedings, as well as to thank them for their willingness to answer to the call of duty in accepting this brief as a Legal Aid matter.
