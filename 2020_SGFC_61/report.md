Custody care and control, access and welfare of child

30 June 2020

### District Judge Jen Koh:

## Background to this matter

1       The parties met through an arranged marriage and they were match made by the Defendant husband’s (‘the husband’) mother through parental connections of both the husband’s family and the Plaintiff wife’s (‘the wife’) family in late 2010. The parties and their parents decided they suited; they had a customary wedding in India in June 2012 and subsequently registered their marriage in Singapore in July 2012.

2       After the marriage, the parties resided with the husband’s parents in the parents’ flat at Compassville Street. To all intents and purposes, this was the matrimonial home. The parties subsequently bought their own flat at Jalan Tenteram in November 2016 but the parties did not live there as a family beyond 6 to 7 months.

3       The parties’ only child, a daughter (‘the child’), was born in November 2013. She is about 6 years old. From July 2018, the child is currently with the husband and his parents and they reside at the parents’ flat at Compassville Street.

4       The husband is about 39 years old and has a Masters in Engineering Management from Singapore. He works as an xxx with the Republic of Singapore Air Force. In his Statement of Claim, he lists his occupation as ‘Military Expert’. The wife is about 32 years old. She has a Masters in Political Science from India. She works as an administrative assistant in a local hospital.

## Legal proceedings

#### Divorce proceedings

5       On 10 September 2018, the husband commenced a writ of divorce to dissolve the marriage after some 6 years on the fact that the marriage had broken down irretrievably in that the wife had behaved in such a way that he could no longer reasonably be expected to live with her.

6       The wife contested the writ and filed a defence in October 2018. She did not file a counterclaim. The wife contested the allegations and sought a dismissal of the writ.

7       The matter was eventually set down for trial on a contested basis with the husband calling as witnesses his parents and a teacher from the school the child was attending. The wife relied on her own testimony. I heard the contested trial over 2 days on 4 July 2019 and 2 August 2019. I dismissed the writ on 2 August 2019. The husband filed an appeal and my grounds of decision are set out in _VBX v VBA_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGFC 119</span>. The husband did not proceed with his appeal.

#### Applications for Personal Protection Orders (PPO)

8       The parties also instituted applications for PPOs, details of which follows:

> (a)     SSxxx2/2016 filed by the husband against the wife on 3 October 2016. This was withdrawn on 5 December 2016.

> (b)     SSxxx3/2016 filed by the husband’s father against the wife on 3 October 2016. This was withdrawn on 5 December 2016.

> (c)     SSxxx4/2019 filed by the husband on behalf of the child against the wife on 13 August 2019. I heard the matter and dismissed the application on 4 December 2019. There was no appeal against this decision.

> (d)     SSxxx9/2019 filed by the wife against the husband on 15 August 2019. I heard the matter and dismissed the application on 4 December 2019. There was no appeal against this decision.

> (e)     SSxxx0/2019 filed by the wife against the husband’s brother on 15 August 2019. I heard the matter and dismissed the application on 4 December 2019. There was no appeal against this decision.

> (f)     SSx2/2020 filed by the husband on behalf of the child against the wife on 6 January 2020. I heard the matter on 26 March 2020. The husband withdrew his application on 26 March 2020.

#### Originating summonses

9       With the dismissal of the divorce proceedings and because there were pending custody and access orders pertaining to the child, the parties then commenced the originating summonses for determination of the issues of custody care and control and access of the child.

## Interim application for custody care and control by the wife

10     As set out in paragraph 3, the husband with the child and his parents moved back into the parents’ flat in July 2018 leaving the wife in the parties’ flat at Jalan Tenteram. Since then, the wife’s contact with the child had been fraught with difficulties. By and large, the wife experienced issues with contact and whilst she attributed blame for this to the husband and/or his family members, the husband said that that the difficulty with contact was because of a breakdown in the wife’s relationship with the child and thus of her own making.

11     Prior to the dismissal of the writ filed by the husband, the wife filed an application for interim care and access in November 2018. Pending a full hearing, at a case conference on 27 November 2018, as the wife wanted a resumption of contact with the child, parties agreed for access to be preliminarily conducted through a Divorce Specialist Support Agency (DSSA). The access carried on for about 8 sessions between February to March 2019 and a report from the DSSA was furnished to court. The interim application filed by the wife was heard on 7 May 2019. The parties agreed to a joint custody order and for the DSSA sessions to continue with the parties and the child attending counselling. The matter was to be fixed for a review after the DSSA furnished their report.

12     The 2nd DSSA report was furnished on 23 July 2019. Parties were then in the midst of the contested divorce proceedings, in a trial which I heard. When I dismissed the writ on 2 August 2019, I informed the parties that the 2nd DSSA report was positive with regard the relationship between the wife and the child. I asked the parties to consider the issues of contact between the mother and the child as this would now be an issue in a separate proceeding following the dismissal of the writ if there was no agreement.

## OSGs consolidated

13     The wife filed OSG125/2019 on 6 August 2019. There was an altercation between the parties over the National Day holidays in August 2019. This led to cross applications for PPOs filed on 13 and 15 August 2019. These were dismissed after a trial on 4 December 2019. The husband then also filed OSG148/2019 on 17 September 2019. Both the OSGs were consolidated with OSG125/2019 as the lead action purely because it was filed first in time. Pending the hearing of the OSGs, DSSA was continued.

## Child Representative appointed

14     The husband also filed an application for the appointment of a Child Representative (CR). After hearing parties, I made the order for the appointment on 22 October 2019. The CR filed her submission on 28 January 2020. Certain recommendations were made and further contact was put in place between the wife and the child. The CR also clarified that her recommendations were interim in nature to the extent that they were to be reviewed after the trial of a PPO application filed by the husband on behalf of the child against the wife (SSx2/2020).

## Hearing of the OSGs and SSx2/2020

15     The events of the PPO were unfortunately intertwined with the issues of care and control and access as one of the submissions by the husband pertained to the child’s fear of a violent mother. I dealt with the 3 earlier PPO applications and dismissed the applications on 4 December 2019. The husband filed another PPO application on 6 January 2020 vide SSx2/2020. This was fixed for trial on 26 March 2020.

16     At the hearing of the OSGs on 26 February 2020, the hearing was deferred because of this latest PPO application. The wife was alleged to have hurt the child and the husband’s helper in an incident that took place on a bus on 2 January 2020. The issue of contact with the child to the wife, if the husband succeeded in his application for care and control, would be dependent on the outcome of the PPO application. The OSG was thus fixed to be heard with SSx2/2020 on 26 March 2020.

17     The husband also informed that he had applied for CCTV footage of the incident and both the husband and the wife were confident that the CCTV would exonerate one or the other in their recounting of what transpired on 2 January 2020.

18     At the trial of the PPO application on 26 March 2020, the investigating officer (who had been subpoenaed by the husband) played the video of the CCTV footage for parties and counsel. The husband withdrew his application for PPO after a review of the CCTV footage.

19     Unfortunately, the Covid19 pandemic led to a delay in the final resolution of the matter. When it was clarified that the 1st circuit breaker was to be extended, I decided to deliver my orders, with the parties’ consent, by way of a Registrar’s Notice. This was done on 15 May 2020.

## Orders for the OSGs 15 May 2020

20     After hearing parties and considering the evidence and submissions, I made orders on 15 May 2020 (the husband is the Defendant and the wife is the Plaintiff in the orders):

> (1)     The parties shall continue to have joint custody of the child of the marriage, B (f) (‘the child’). For purposes of joint custody:

>> (a)       Each party is to inform the other of any change in the child’s schedule within 3 days of the change.

>> (b)       The parties shall email school notices and academic progress reports and results to each other within 24 hours of receipt.

>> (c)       Neither party shall stop the other from attending a school event in which parents are invited.

>> (d)       The Defendant is to keep the child’s passport, birth certificate and health booklet with copies to be furnished to the Plaintiff within 7 days of the date of this order.

>> (e)       The Defendant is to hand over the documents in paragraph 1(d) to the Plaintiff as and when requested by the Plaintiff and the Plaintiff is to return the documents to the Defendant within 48 hours after use.

>> (b)       For the weeks in which the Plaintiff has an off day on Saturday, the child is to be dropped off at the Plaintiff’s residence after school on Friday and picked up by the Defendant on Saturday at 7.30 pm.

>> (c)       For the weeks in which the Plaintiff has an off day on Sunday, the Plaintiff is to pick the child up from the void deck of the Defendant’s residence on Saturday at 7.30 pm and the Defendant is to pick the child up from the Plaintiff’s residence at 7.30 pm.

>> (d)       The above arrangements shall continue notwithstanding that there are public holidays and school holidays save that if the child does not have to attend school, then the pick up time by the Plaintiff shall be at 9 am at the void deck of the Defendant’s flat and the Defendant is to pick the child up from the Plaintiff’s residence at 7.30 pm.

>> (e)       The Plaintiff is to make the arrangements for the handover of the child with the school bus or otherwise as the case may be if there is no need for the child to attend school on a particular day.

>> (f)       The parties are to agree to overseas holidays and to arrange make up time if their time with the child is affected.

>> (g)       Save as agreed, the child is not to travel outside of jurisdiction without the other party’s consent; otherwise, with leave of court.

The 3 conditions are to be complied with before a trip is undertaken.

>> (i)       The Defendant is to hand over the passport of the child to the Plaintiff for purposes of paragraphs 2(f) and (h).

>> (j)       When the child is with either party, the child is to attend all her scheduled activities and do her homework.

> (4)     The parties are to ensure that their immediate and extended family members, friends and helpers (where applicable) likewise not denigrate the other party to the child nor make negative or inappropriate comments of the other party within the child’s earshot.

> (5)     The parties are to restrain from making audio and video recordings of the child during contact time and relying on these recordings for purposes of any court proceedings or to show to any other party for the purpose of denigrating the other party to the child.

> (6)     The parties are to attend counselling with the Counselling and Psychological Services of the Family Justice Courts for the purpose of learning to effectively co-parent and to establish acceptable modes of communication with each other so that the child is assured of both parents’ love when she is with the other party.

> (7)     No orders as to costs of these proceedings.

> (8)     Liberty to apply.

## Joint custody not disputed

21     The parties agreed to a joint custody order. However, in view of the litigious conduct of the parties, it was prudent to set out some parameters to ensure that the parties would co-operate with each other and to specify certain areas in which they could begin to work together on. This is set out in paragraphs (1)(a) to (e) of the orders in paragraph 20 above.

22     Whilst joint parenting is advocated in case law and authorities, the harsh reality is that it may be difficult for warring parties coming out of fierce litigation to immediately embark on a co-operative journey after years of distrust and tensions. Having dealt with this family for about 2 years, I set out core areas they were to communicate on to hopefully nudge the parties towards a more natural parenting relationship in due course. I also directed counselling in the hopes the assistance of a specialist would help them to re-open communication, set aside their marital conflict to focus on their parental relationship and to work together for the welfare of their only child.

23     I refer parties to _AZZ v BAA_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 44</span> and remind the husband and the wife that even belligerent litigious parties (in that case) were tasked to have a responsibility to promote the children’s best interests; that joint custody is a signal to both parents that they have a joint and enduring parenting responsibility to advance the children’s best interests. Hence, issues such as which parent to retain the child’s important documents, travel plans etc are issues that this set of parents must communicate and agree upon, relying on their love for this child and with both wanting the best for her.

## Issue of care and control

24     The dispute centred on the issue of care and control of the child. The wife prayed for liberal access to the husband if she was awarded care and control. The husband prayed for supervised access for the wife with the child if he was granted care and control.

## The husband’s position on the issue of care and control

25     The husband’s submission was as follows:

> (a)     That he has done everything in his power to devote his life to the child’s wellbeing.

> (b)     He arranged his work hours to be flexible so that he could spend as much time as possible with the child.

> (c)     He roped in his family members to help in her care and to ensure that she had a joyful and well-rounded childhood.

> (d)     That the status quo should prevail as the husband had regular work hours and also could have flexible hours; that he had an established and stable routine; that he had strong family support; that he has been the main caregiver. That the child was thriving under his care where she had been solely since July 2018 and that she had always lived with him, his parents and the helper.

> (e)     That her current physical environment was superior as she had her own bedroom and play area personally designed and paid for by the husband.

> (f)     That the wife did not have a care plan; that she had a history of unstable and violent behaviour since 2016 and had caused emotional mental and physical harm to the child and that the child was afraid of her and uncomfortable being alone with her. In contrast, the husband had submitted a detailed care plan as set out in pages 14 to 17 of his first Submissions.

> (g)     That the wife’s work hours were inconsistent and her off days not fixed and when she was off work, she would be pre-occupied with her own activities; claiming to be tired from work and/or using her phone thereby neglecting the child.

> (h)     When parties were together, the wife had the assistance of 4 other adults in the home and after the separation, the bulk of her access was at DSSA and that her unsupervised access had only been for a few days.

> (i)     That the wife’s home was messy and that her living environment was not fit for the child.

> (j)     The husband also relied on the wife’s violence and cited incidents since 2016 and submitted that the wife caused the child emotional anguish, that the child was afraid of the wife and uncomfortable with being alone at home with her.

> (k)     That there were fundamental problems between the wife and the child.

> (l)     That the child had not stayed with the wife for more than a year since July 2018 and she was happy now and thriving in her current care arrangements.

> (m)     That the wife took no action until November 2018 to apply for custody and that she did not apply for access in the intervening months between July and November 2018. She was content to let the husband have care of the child.

> (n)     The husband denied alienating the child from the wife and he proposed that supervised access was to continue.

## The wife’s position on the issue of care and control

26     The wife’s application was premised on the following submissions:

> (a)     That she was the primary caregiver and in her first submissions, she set out her daily routine with the child as well as the husband’s family involvement with the child and her. She submitted that she was the one who took leave to attend to the child’s first few days in school (playgroup) and it was only after the child was settled that the helper took over.

> (b)     During the period when she was forced out of the husband’s parents’ home, she would go there to spend time with the child.

> (c)     She blamed the husband’s mother for planting seeds of discord in her marriage and in her relationship with the child; she said that the husband’ mother had interfered with her care of her child and she referred to an incident on 8 August 2019 (leading to the earlier PPO applications).

> (d)     That the husband stopped her from having access and that he had no regard for court orders allowing her have access or contact with the child. That his pattern of alienation would continue if he was granted care and control.

> (e)     That the husband’s work hours had been erratic and he had come home late at least 4 times a week and it was unlikely that he was home by 6.30 pm as alleged. Because of the limitations of his work hours, he could not be the parent with day to day care.

> (f)     That when the child is with her, the child was happy and relaxed and content but when with the husband, he would tell the child that he would call the police and this did not reflect that he had the child’s best interests at heart.

> (g)     That the best interests of the child would be served with her having care and control and that she had a care plan.

> (h)     That the maternal bond was a factor to be considered by the court and this was not to be severed by the concerted actions of the husband and his family.

> (i)     That she had assistance of her mother who could help with care of the child when she is at work.

## Court’s findings and decision

27     The husband’s submission can be summarized into the following categories (a) status quo argument (b) that the wife’s violence and violent behaviour makes her an unsuitable caregiver and that the child is afraid of her (c) the child’s wishes (d) the wife’s imperfect care arrangements _vis a vis_ his care arrangements.

28     The wife’s submission can be summarized into the following categories (a) parental alienation by the husband and his family members (b) manipulation of the child by the husband and his family (c) reliance on the maternal bond (d) her care plan.

## Legal principles

29     Section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act Cap 122 (GIA) directs that in any proceedings before any court in which the custody or upbringing of an infant is in question, the court in deciding that question shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration. Neither the father nor the mother shall be deemed to have any right superior to each other.

30     There have been significant decisions explaining or illustrating what the welfare of the child means. In _Soon Peck Wah v Woon Che Chye_ \[1991\] 3 SLR (R) 430 the Court of Appeal adopted an English academic (Rayden and Jackson on Divorce and Family Matters) description of “welfare of the child”:

> “The word ‘welfare’ must be taken in its widest sense. It has been said that the welfare of the child is not to be measured by money only nor by physical comfort only; the moral and religious welfare of the child must be considered as well as his physical well-being; nor can the ties of affection be disregarded. The rights and wishes of parents must be assessed and weighed in their bearing on the welfare of the child in conjunction with all other factors relative to that issue. The question for the judge is not what the essential justice of the case requires but what the best interests of the child requires.

> The welfare of the child should, therefore, be understood in the widest sense. It is not to be measured in money or physical comfort alone. The child’s moral and religious well-being as well as ties of affection must also be considered together with his or her physical well-being. The rights and wishes of the parents can also be considered in conjunction with the child’s needs.”

## Applying the legal principles to parties’ submissions

#### The parent who better provided material comforts

31     The court therefore considers more than the _provision of material comforts_ which is a submission canvassed by the husband – that his physical environment was superior as she (the child) had her own bedroom and play area personally designed and paid for by the husband. That, as set out in the case above, is but one of many factors the court considers in determining what is in the child’s best interests ie physical well being and comfort. The husband submitted that the wife’s home was untidy and messy and therefore not a conducive environment for her to have care and control. The wife denied this and has set out in affidavit that the child has a home with her.

#### Preservation of the status quo

32     The husband submits on _the preservation of the status quo_. He submitted that the child has been solely in his care and that of his parents and helper since July 2018 and that she had always lived with him, his parents and the helper; that the child had not stayed with the wife for more than a year since July 2018 and she was happy now and thriving in her current care arrangements.

33     I raise a note here about the reason why the wife was not staying with the husband after this date in July 2018. An altercation had occurred on 18 July 2018 between the parties as well as the husband’s parents; also involving the helper. The wife was accused of hurting her mother-in-law leading to paramedics as well as the police being called. On 19 July 2018, the husband said that the wife abused the helper and the wife then left the home. The wife said she was actually leaving for work. After these incidents, the husband, his parents, the helper and the child left the Jalan Tenteram flat and returned to the flat owned by his parents in which parties had stayed after the marriage until the Jalan Tenteram flat was ready. Thereafter, the wife said she had issues with contact with the child. Her attempts to see the child were met with great resistance from the husband and the parents and there were recorded incidents on 3 and 27 August 2018 as well as 20 October 2018.

34     I set the incident leading to the parties living separately so that there is a context to this submission. The wife did not leave or abandon the child. It is difficult for the wife to counter an argument on the preservation of a status quo which was forced upon her. The wife tried in various ways to have her relationship with the child continued but she was stymied at every turn to the extent of police/security being called on her and being thwarted by the adults with the child at the material time. To compound matters, at various parts of his submission, the husband, in seeking an order for care and control, states that the wife has no family support and has no one in Singapore who can help her with her care plan. I do not think that assisted his argument. The wife was forced out of her familial life to live on her own. The husband and his family members closed ranks on her. I did not place too much weight on this argument of a preservation of a status quo which was created ‘artificially’ and which was perpetuated through the concerted efforts of the husband and his family members in denying the wife contact with the child.

#### The parent who showed the greater concern for the child

35     I next considered the husband’s submission that the wife took no steps to see the child and that she filed her application for interim orders only in November 2018, some 4 months after the parties’ involuntarily separated in July 2018. His submission appeared to be one founded on the basis that the wife was not the parent who showed the greater concern for the child. This principle was propounded in the decision of Tan _Siew Kee_ v _Chua Ah Boey_ \[1987\] SLR (R) 725 in that whilst the court considered the various alternatives each party offered the child, the court observed that the mother in that case showed greater concern for herself than the child and although she alleged that the father forcibly removed the child, she took no steps to recover the child. It was the father’s action in obtaining a court order that persuaded the court that he was the parent who would be the better carer for the child.

36     The facts of this case however do not support the husband’s contention that the wife did not do anything until 4 months later. The husband submitted that she only filed the interim application in November 2018. This is factually correct but in paragraph 33 above, I set out the wife’s actions in trying to see the child in July, August and in October 2018 to the extent that she went to the child’s school to attempt contact. Unfortunately for the wife, the husband’s mother was (and remains) the school’s principal (the child’s school before she started primary school) stopped her through her school teachers, from attending the child’s concert. She was stopped again when the husband’s parents cried for help from a bank’s security when she chanced upon them outside a bank and wanted to carry the child. Claims made against the wife included attempts to remove the child from the husband and his family.

37     However, the husband does not, and did not at that material time, have a better right than the wife with regard the child. He had physical care of the child purely by removing the child in July 2018 and then depriving the wife of contact. He did not file an application for care and control of the child. In fact, as stated by the husband, the wife has no family in Singapore and she then finally approached SINDA who assigned a lawyer to assist her in November 2018. She then filed the interim application. Looking at the timeframes, there was no delay on the wife’s part and she acted proactively to resume contact with the child within her capability.

38     If that principle of law is applied to the facts of this case, it would appear that it was the wife who showed the greater concern for the child. It was only after the dismissal of the writ and the wife filing an application under the OSG that the husband then filed his cross application.

#### The wife’s alleged violence and her continuing violent behaviour and that the child was afraid of her

39     The husband relies on the wife’s violence. According to him, she had caused the child hurt and put her in fear such that a PPO should be granted against her to protect the child. In the husband’s affidavits in support of his application, he referred to several incidents.

40     In SSxxx4/2019, the husband referred to an incident on 11 August 2019. Following arrangements for contact with the child for the wife, the wife kept the child over the period which the husband had proposed. The child was not returned to him and the husband then went to the wife’s residence at Jalan Tenteram flat with his brother and 2 police officers (the wife said more than 2) on 11 August 2019. The husband’s parents also came to the corridor of the Jalan Tenteram flat. An altercation ensued and the husband filed the application for PPO on 13 August 2019. After hearing the parties in a full trial and assisted with video clippings as well as witnesses’ testimonies, I had dismissed the husband’s application. I did not find that the wife had acted violently nor that the child was in fear of the wife.

41     In SSx2/2020, the wife was alleged to have hurt the child and the husband’s helper in an incident that took place on a bus on 2 January 2020. The husband applied for CCTV footage of the incident from the bus company and the parties agreed that the video footage was be instrumental in determining the issue of the wife’s violent behaviour or otherwise. Parties would then structure the argument for the OSGs dependent on the outcome of the PPO application. After reviewing the CCTV footage a few times (about 4 times), the evidence was conclusive that the wife did not act violently and that the husband’s helper had instigated the altercation. The CCTV footage also showed that the child displayed no fear of the wife, as alleged by the husband. The husband sensibly agreed to withdraw the application. Nonetheless, as he had referred to this incident in his affidavits, this has to be addressed.

42     The husband also referred to past incidents of the wife’s violence and violent conduct. In _VBX v VBA_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGFC 119</span>, I had considered these allegations by the husband and dismissed them. The husband did not pursue his appeal with regard the findings. It is pertinent to note that the incidents of her alleged misconduct included the use of vulgarities but these were centred around her unhappiness at being kept away from her child and/or the husband and his family members ostracizing her or undermining her in her marital relationship. It also did not help the husband’s case in that he had taped recordings of these conversations. The wife spoke freely and expressed herself unequivocally not knowing that she was being taped and of course the husband (who was doing the recording) by contrast appeared ‘reasonable’ during these conversations.

43     Hence, the husband should not be allowed to rely on these incidents of the wife’s misconduct or alleged violence in which specific findings had been made after trials and for which he either did not appeal nor prosecute his appeal.

#### Child’s wishes

44     The husband submitted that the child would be able to express an independent opinion as to whom she would want to live with and that the child had expressed such a wish; namely, to live with the husband.

45     The GIA, unlike the Women’s Charter Cap 353, is silent on the consideration of a child’s wishes in questions pertaining to the child’s custody and welfare. However, the child’s wishes would be considered under Section 3 of the GIA as the voice of the child would be relevant in assessing what is in a child’s best interests and his or her welfare. This approach (of hearing from the child) was endorsed by the Court of Appeal in _ZO v ZP_ and another appeal <span class="citation">\[2011\] 3 SLR 647</span> at \[15\] and \[16\] that the wishes of the child can be ascertained from interviews. Whilst there is no prescribed age, much depends on the child’s maturity as children mature differently. The Court of Appeal also cautioned that a child might be primed or coached prior to an interview with a judge but expressed confidence that a judge would be sufficiently astute to discern whether a child has in fact been so primed or coached.

46     I agree fully with the statements made in the case cited above. However, I declined to interview the child in this case for various reasons. Firstly, I had the benefit of independent reports as well as the benefit of video recordings (discussed further below). I did not want to subject the child to interviews and questions seeing that this child had been independently assessed by the counsellors at the DSSA, attended the Child in Between programme and had been interviewed by a CR. Secondly, I had the benefit of watching the child on several video recordings and listening to her conversations with the adults she interacted with. Thirdly, the child has been primarily in the husband’s physical care as well as exposed to his family members who regrettably (and understandably) have no love for the wife. I did not see how viable an interview would be with the child coming to court after living with the husband and family members with rather entrenched negativity about the wife.

47     The negativity and antagonism was apparent in the trials and this is was only natural given that parties were caught up in highly litigious proceedings. However, the impact of that and the constant exposure to these adults whom she lived with would have coloured the child’s perceptions when she speaks about her mother. An interview would yield an inevitable result. In any event, as elaborated below, I did make a finding that the child was manipulated emotionally to some degree by these adults. As such, whilst the child may not be primed or coached for an interview, the child’s wishes would certainly be skewed a certain way.

48     I therefore declined to interview the child in light of the evidence that was already before me and because of the circumstances as highlighted above.

#### Maternal bond

49     The wife relies on the maternal bond as a submission that she is to be awarded care and control of the child.

50     Whilst the courts do consider the maternal bond, there is no presumption of this in favour of mothers nor a generalization that young children are generally placed in the care of their mothers. The courts have awarded care and control of young children to fathers as well as mothers (see eg _Tan Siew Kee v Chua Ah Boey_ \[1987\] SLR (R) 725 where care and control of an infant boy was given to a father). The facts of each individual case and the circumstances of each case are relevant for the court in making a determination and the maternal bond is a consideration; not _the_ consideration.

#### Parties’ work hours and schedules

51     The husband said he had a flexible schedule and stable work hours contrasted with the wife who worked on shifts. He said he rearranged his schedule so that he could at home with the child and to cater to her needs. Whilst he did travel, he submitted that he had an arrangement with his employers that he would not be deployed overseas unless necessary. On the other hand, he said that the wife worked shifts and that her off days were not fixed. She also worked during the weekends. After work, the husband said that she was preoccupied with her own activities and was usually too tired to care for the child.

52     The wife said that the husband’s schedule was not as flexible as he submitted. She referred to his employer’s letter at page 52 of his affidavit filed 17 September 2019 that if there were issues of national security, training and operations demands including overseas deployment would take precedence over personal needs. She said that the husband did travel frequently and that this arrangement of flexible hours was only entered into for purposes of the proceedings. On the other hand, she could make arrangements at work as well as arranged for her mother to stay in Singapore to assist with the child’s care.

53     Both parties are working and have both submitted that they could make arrangements to be with the child at home. However, to a certain extent, both would be dependent on other caregivers during their work hours especially when the child was home from school. I therefore did not find that one had a better care arrangement than the other with regard their work hours and jobs.

#### Caregiving plans

54     The husband’s care plan included his parents and the helper and he said these adults have been constant figures in the child’s life. The wife relied on her mother and likewise submitted that the child has a good relationship with the latter and enjoyed the food that she prepared.

55     Again, there was no particularly better caregiving plans one _vis a vis_ the other. The husband works and returns home early enough to spend time with the child. The wife said that she has re-arranged her schedule to be physically present if and when the child is with her. I see that both parties are determined to be present and available for the child and this is commendable.

#### Parental alienation

56     The wife submitted the husband was intent on alienating the child from her. She said that this was evident as well from his application which proposed only supervised access to the wife if he was granted care and control. She said that there has been a concerted effort on his part as well as that of his family members to alienate the child from her. This was the more stark when she did spend time with the child and the child was happy, relaxed and content with her. However, when the husband was around, he would call the police, create a scene and make a fuss such that the child associated time with the wife with trauma and the calling of police. She submitted that the child had been manipulated and influenced against her by the husband and his family members.

57     The husband denied this and said that the child was afraid of the wife because of a history of unstable and violent behaviour since 2016 and that she had caused emotional mental and physical harm to the child. He said that he promoted the child’s contact with the wife and that he was supportive of her having time with the child but because of the history of the abuse, this should be in a supervised setting.

58     In paragraphs 39 to 43 above, I had set out that the allegations of the wife’s alleged violence had not been borne out in the evidence in the contested divorce and the contested PPO trials. I will also elaborate further on findings with regard the child’s behaviour with the wife when I consider the issue of independent evidence. As for the husband’s submission that he was supportive of the child’s contact with the wife, this was not borne out in the evidence with the calling of police, the making of reports and the recordings he made to implicate the wife in some way.

59     To a certain extent, I find that the child is being manipulated by the husband and his family to _some_ degree; I make it clear that I do not find that it is deliberate or intentional or that it amounts to parental alienation as set out and defined in literature on this topic. I am of the view that the husband may say certain things or act in a certain way but his conduct is motivated by his love for the child. For example, he took the child’s word as well as his helper’s account of the latest incident in January 2020 (alleging violence on the wife’s part) to the extent of filing a PPO application (SSx2/2020) and applying for CCTV footage from the bus company and leaving work to retrieve the child even though he was not himself present at the incident.

60     In another video footage which counsel and parties watched together for purposes of the PPO applications in SSxxx4/2019, it was apparent that the child was relaying answers that she felt that the husband and his family members (who were in the car with them) wanted to hear and this descended to the extent of her saying that she was not given any food by the wife notwithstanding photographs exhibited by the wife showed that the child had a hearty meal of chicken rice etc. I was also concerned by words with certain connotations used by the husband which egged the child on, such as telling her that he was right, that the wife would not keep her word and, that the child could trust him to ‘save’ her etc. The husband gave the child an impression that she needed to be ‘saved’ or ‘rescued’ from her mother and this was disturbing when I had photographs showing a laughing happy child with her mother for the same period.

61     It is obvious that the child is severely triangulated in the conflict and felt compelled to please the husband by saying what he wanted to hear. Hence, as set out in paragraph 59, I find that the husband did manipulate the child emotionally.

## Independent evidence

62     At several places in these grounds, I had referred to the independent evidence that assisted with the decision that I made. I now elaborate.

#### DSSA reports in the divorce proceedings prior to dismissal of the writ

63     I was able to rely on the DSSA reports of 21 March 2019 and 23 July 2019. To enable the counsellors to do their sensitive work which includes eliciting the confidences of the child and the parties, the reports are closed reports and confidential in nature. However, I informed the parties that the reports revealed that the wife and the child were able to bond with each other and the recommendation was for independent contact between the wife and the child with no requirement for supervision of access.

64     Following that disclosure, the husband arranged for the wife to have contact with the child in August 2019 over the National Day holidays. However, this led to the filing of SSxxx4/2019 and subsequent events in which the child’s contact with the wife was curtailed.

65     Notwithstanding the events that occurred after the DSSA reports, it is important to point out that the assessment was independent and covered the months of February, March, May, June and July 2019. I placed some weight on the recommendations bearing in mind the reports spanned some months, was conducted independently and amply assessed the relationship between the child and the mother.

#### Child Representative (CR)’s submissions of 28 January 2020

66     The CR rightly noted the child is a bright child and clearly conflicted and unhappy about the ‘fighting’ between the parties. She was not kept away by the ongoing litigation between the parties and used words that had been used in the litigation process such as words used to describe the wife and orders that were being prayed for. This was alarming and supported to a certain extent the findings that I had made as to the manipulation of the child by the husband and his family members.

67     The CR did not observe any palpable fear or harm suffered by the child at the hands of the wife, again supporting the findings that I had made that the wife is not violent towards the child. The CR’s recommendation of an accompanying adult (in this case the husband) was to be tagged to the outcome of SSx2/2020. This was a precautionary recommendation on the CR’s part and with the outcome of SSx2/2020, I therefore again reverted to the recommendations of the DSSA (no need for supervision) premised on their findings that the wife and the child are able to bond with each other.

68     The CR also recommended that when assisted contact was undertaken (with the husband accompanying the child at that material time), the husband ought not to carry the child. I find this recommendation telling as in his own way, the husband did obstruct the resumption of the relationship between the child and the wife.

69     The recommendations of the CR were that once the accompanying party was removed (after SSx2/2020), the wife should have increased time with the child which included substantial access during the weekdays, the weekends, public holidays and school holidays with overnight stays.

70     I find that the CR’s recommendations aligned to a large extent to the recommendations of the DSSA. There was no reason for the contact between the wife and the child to be ‘accompanied’ or ‘supervised’ as submitted by the husband.

#### Videos and photographs tendered

71     I had referred to some of these recordings in the earlier paragraphs. I refer now specifically to the CCTV footage of the incident on 2 January 2020 which was referred to by the husband to counter the wife’s application for care and control and to bolster his submission that the child was frightened of the wife. That footage clearly showed that the child was not afraid of the wife at all. Even when the helper left the bus, the child sat with the wife, conversed with her and then sat across from the wife in a different seat quietly. She was comfortable enough to “slouch” on the bus seat. She did not make any attempt to leave the bus to be with the helper and she exhibited no fear of the wife.

## Concluding remarks

72     Applying the overarching principles of what is in this child’s best interests, I am of the view that having unsupervised regular contact time with the wife is key. It was for this reason that I ordered shared care and control. Given the contact time which the child would be with the wife, I declined to label this as access or to make an award of sole care and control in the hopes that this would remove the sting of ‘winning’ or ‘losing’ as contemplated by the parties with these proceedings. This case is so much more than that.

73     This case cries out for an order for shared care and control to dispel the concept of a winner in this custody battle and to stop one party bandying an order of care and control such that he or she is superior to the other. It is in this child’s best interests to have contact time with regularity with the wife without the husband’s presence and without interference from any third parties be they extended family members or helpers or the like.

74     Looking at the different factors considered in this decision, there was no impediment for such an order to be made. Once settled and regularized into a routine, I am sure that this child would thrive with both parents’ love and attention. It is therefore important that this set of parents communicate with each other. It is important that neither denigrate the other to the child nor that the extended family members do the same. The child must be assured that it is perfectly fine for her to love both her parents and to express her love and affection without fears of repercussion; worse, of being cross-examined.

75     Parties should also stop recording the child for use as ‘evidence’ and support the child wholeheartedly as a child; _their_ child - not as a prize to be claimed or as the spoils of war. Parties will also have to attend counselling to deal with their marital issues setting these aside to learn how to co-parent instead as they only have this one child; this one child who deserves both of them to be whole and heathy emotionally so that she can likewise be whole and healthy emotionally.
