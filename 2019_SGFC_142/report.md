Family Law – Child – Relocation

16 December 2019

### District Judge Lo Wai Ping:

## Introduction

1       In 2015, the Plaintiff (“**Father**”) commenced divorce proceedings against the Defendant (“**Mothe**r”) based on the marriage having broken down irretrievably on account of her unreasonable behavior. The divorce was uncontested and final judgment was entered on 31 March 2016. At all times, the parties were represented by counsel.

2       By a consent order dated 28 December 2015, the parties agreed to have joint custody, care and control of their only child, a daughter who was 4 years old in 2015 (the “**Daughter**”). 2 years later, by a consent order dated 15 September 2017, retaining their shared care and control, the parties agreed on the living arrangements for the Daughter substantially on an equal basis. These two (2) consents orders are collectively referred to as the “**Existing Consent Orders**”.

3       On 22 May 2018, by way of summons 1746/2018 (the “**Relocation Application**”), the Mother applied for leave for the Daughter (then 7 plus years old in 2018) to relocate to Mauritius with her, and in connection with the application (in the event leave was granted for the relocation), the Mother also applied for the Existing Consent Orders to be varied so that she would have sole care and control of the Daughter instead of having shared care and control together with the Father.

4       After hearing counsel and given the concerns raised, I ordered a specific issues report (“**SIR”**) to assist the Court to have a better insight into the Daughter’s overall situation, her relationship with her parents and her needs and wishes. This independent assessment was conducted in 2019 by a psychologist with the Family Justice Courts’ Counselling and Psychological Services unit and included observations and interviews conducted with each parent and the Daughter.

5       At the end, after considering the submissions and the evidence including the SIR, I dismissed the Relocation Application on 15 May 2019 with costs awarded to the Father.

6       On 22 August 2019, the Mother filed an appeal against my decision having obtained an extension of time to do so and these are my grounds of decision.

7       I will first set out in brief the background and the law on relocation before explaining the reasons for my decision.

## Background

8       In 2006, the parties met in London. In 2008, they moved to Singapore and have been residing in Singapore since. In 2009, the parties were married in Mauritius.

9       The Father (aged 40) is a British citizen and he had spent his adolescent years in Singapore when his father was posted to work in Singapore. The Mother (aged 39) was born in Mauritius and is both a Mauritian and French citizen. In 1999, the Mother, then 18 years old, left Mauritius to pursue her undergraduate studies in France. Thereafter, she continued with her post-graduate studies in UK and stayed behind in UK to work after graduation. Since 1999, the Mother has worked and resided out of Mauritius although she has visited Mauritius for holidays.

10     The Daughter was born in Singapore in 2011 about 2 years after the marriage. The Daughter holds British, French and Mauritian passports and has been living in Singapore since her birth.

11     At the time of the hearing, the Father was working in a foreign bank in Singapore and he has been working for that foreign bank for the past 16 years. The Mother was also working in another foreign bank in Singapore and she has been working for that bank for the past 4 years (since 2014). Prior to that, she had been working in the same bank as the Father (in London and then in Singapore) until the birth of their Daughter in 2011. By the end of December 2018, both parties have been living in Singapore for 10½ years.

12     At the time of the hearing, the Daughter was studying in an international school in Singapore. She is presently 8 years old.

13     This Relocation Application was the Mother’s second application for relocation. Her first relocation application was made in April 2017. The Daughter was then 6 years old. In that first application (“the **2017 London Relocation Application**”), the Mother had wanted to relocate the Daughter with her to London, United Kingdom (“**UK**”). Then, she had received an attractive job offer to work in London. The application was contested by the Father on the basis that it was not in the Daughter’s interest to do so as Singapore was the child’s home and she needed stability, especially in this early stage of her life. This was despite UK being the Father’s own homeland and where the Father’s parents live. On 15 September 2017, the Mother withdrew her application (without prejudice to her rights to apply for relocation elsewhere in future) and a consent order was recorded with the agreement of the parties, essentially allowing the Daughter to spend about equal time with each parent. It provided that from 3 November 2017, the Daughter was on an alternate week arrangement with each parent. There was liberty to change the schedule if in the child’s best interest, by consent, and parties were to evaluate these arrangements every 6 months. This consent order was one of the Existing Consent Orders. I will elaborate on the terms in the later part of my decision.

14     But on 22 May 2018 (about 8 months after her withdrawal of the 2017 London Relocation Application and agreement to the terms in the consent order of 15 September 2017), the Mother filed the current Relocation Application _without prior notice_ to the Father. The Father objected strongly to her Relocation Application and submitted that her proposed relocation of their Daughter with her to Mauritius was not in the welfare of the Daughter.

15     In all, 4 affidavits were filed for the Mother; the Father filed 1 affidavit in reply. The Mother’s 3 supporting affidavits were filed on 22 May 2018. Her first affidavit was her own (“**M1**”), her second affidavit contained 3 signed statements of her 2 sisters and a good friend (“**M2**”) and the third affidavit was by another good friend (“**M3**”). The Father’s affidavit in reply was filed on 16 July 2018 (“**F1**”) and it also contained statements by some friends. The Mother’s final affidavit was filed on 8 August 2018 (“**M4**”).

## The Mother’s Case

16     Briefly, the Mother’s case was as follows:

> (a)     She had come here to Singapore in 2008 because of the Father’s career and to be with him. She stayed in Singapore following their marriage in 2009 and the birth of the Daughter in 2011. However, with their divorce in 2015, there was nothing left to tie her to Singapore as she did not have a meaningful career or close friends or family members here. Her current boyfriend **F** (a French national with whom she has been in a long-term committed relationship since November 2015 and still is) had also left Singapore in August 2016 and presently resides and works in London.

> (b)     She wanted to go back home to Mauritius to “pick up the pieces of her life in a place which is secure and stable (in the short term and also in the long term) for the child and \[her\] and where \[she\] can hope for a better future and more promising circumstances”. In Mauritius, they would receive the love and support of her family and close friends there. There were more career opportunities for her there. She would also remain as the Daughter’s primary caregiver and the secondary caregivers would be the child’s maternal grandparents and aunts.

> (c)     In her view, it was in the Daughter’s best interests to relocate with her to Mauritius as the Daughter was in need of “long-term meaningful and solid family and community support and interaction” and she could only get that in Mauritius. In terms of timing, it was also best for the Daughter to go with her now as the Daughter was still young and adaptable and had not yet put down her roots in Singapore. The Daughter was very close to her maternal extended family (grandparents, aunts and cousins) and very familiar with Mauritius (having been there for holidays in the past). The Daughter had also expressed her desire to live in Mauritius with her extended family and friends. In terms of education, the Daughter would not lose out as she would be placed in a school where she would be able to build long-term friendships and relationships and in an educational system with continuity into higher education.

> (d)     The Mother submitted how being forced to remain in Singapore (given all her major setbacks in career and her isolation without friends or family) would pose a challenge to her health and welfare and this would in turn impact the Daughter’s health and welfare as she was the child’s primary caregiver and had a closer relationship with her than the Father.

> (e)     As for the bond between the Father and Daughter, it was not as strong, robust and vibrant as the Father had opined. If relocation was granted, it was her view that the Father’s relationship with the Daughter could always be maintained and enhanced with the access plan she had proposed.

17     The Father objected strongly to the Relocation Application. The Father’s position was that the Relocation Application was not in the welfare of the Daughter for the following main reasons:

> (a)     The status quo (where parties have joint custody, care and control of the Daughter) was working out well for the Daughter in Singapore and it should not be changed at this time.

> (b)     If the application was allowed, there would be an irreparable loss of her relationship with her loving and devoted father.

> (c)     Singapore was a better place for her than Mauritius. Her home and network was in Singapore, the education system in Singapore was superior to that in Mauritius and she was well-settled in school in Singapore.

> (d)     The Relocation Application was self-serving and unreasonable. It was motivated by the Mother’s self-interest, without considering the Daughter’s welfare.

## The law on relocation of children

18     The applicable legal principles in relocation applications have been set out by the Court of Appeal in _BNS v BNT_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 973</span> (“**_BNS_**”). There is only one fundamental legal principle when considering relocation applications and it is that “**the welfare of the child is paramount and this principle ought to override any other consideration**” (emphasis in original at \[19\] of _BNS_). And, in determining what is in the welfare of the child, the court will need to carefully consider all the relevant factors in each case. This is because the circumstances and dynamics of each family is unique. The assessment of what is in the best interest of the child is therefore “**an intensely fact-centric exercise**” \[emphasis in original\] (_BNS_ at \[28\]) and no one single factor is determinative as observed by the Court of Appeal at \[22\] of _BNS_:

> _“To be clear, what we are effectively saying, at a broader level, is that there can be no pre-fixed precedence or hierarchy among the many composite factors which may inform the court’s decision as to where the child’s best interests ultimately lie: where these factors stand in relation to one another must depend, in the final analysis, on a consideration of all the facts in each case.”_

19     In the recent case of _UFZ v UFY_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHCF 8</span> at \[17\] (“**_UFZ_**”), it was also observed as follows:

> _“While one may draw certain analogies to the cases I have cited, one must never simply approach the relocation decision as a matter of ticking off boxes on a checklist. The issue of relocation is too serious a matter for such a simplistic assessment. As has been emphasized repeatedly, each case must be decided on its own facts, and it is always a question of what is in the welfare of the child.”_

And, at \[8\] of the same case:

> _“The inquiry of what is in the welfare of the child involves a consideration of a multitude of factors. Relocation applications involve one parent exercising his or her authority to relocate the child to another jurisdiction. Two important factors that will come into play will unsurprisingly be: (i) the reasonable wishes of the primary caregiver; and (ii) the child’s loss of relationship with the “left-behind” parent (BNS at \[28\]). These factors, amongst others, are pertinent in helping the court assess what the best interests of the child are. This assessment is “an intensely fact-centric exercise” (BNS at \[28\]) and will remain a very difficult one in all relocation cases. …”_

## Preliminary Issue - Mother’s locus stand to file the Relocation Application

20     A preliminary issue was raised by the Father’s counsel as to whether the Mother had the locus stand to make the Relocation Application given that she was _not_ the primary caregiver of the Daughter and also did _not_ have sole custody or sole care and control under the Existing Consent Orders and in actuality.

21     After hearing both counsel on this, I was of the view that the Mother was _not_ precluded from making the Relocation Application. Under the Existing Consent Orders, the parties had joint custody, care and control of their Daughter which meant that they had equal parental rights and responsibilities over their child. The Father did not have superior rights over the Mother and vice versa. They were both equally entitled to bring a relocation application in respect of their Daughter if they were of the view that it was in her best interests and it was not necessary for the Mother to have first obtained sole custody, or sole care and control of their Daughter before she could make a relocation application. This was also consistent with the statutory direction in sections 3 and 4 of the Guardianship of Infants Act. However, the fact that parties had joint custody, care and control of their Daughter was an important consideration to bear in mind for the Relocation Application.

22     I now explain the reasons why in weighing the evidence before me, I was of the view that the Daughter’s welfare was not best served by allowing the Daughter to relocate with her Mother to Mauritius at this time when she was 7 to 8 years old.

## Decision

23     The Daughter was born in 2011. For the first 4 years of her life, she lived with her Father and Mother in the same household and was jointly cared for by both of them. Even from the time of the divorce in 2015, when the Daughter was 4 years old, up to the date of the hearing of the Relocation Application in 2018, when the Daughter was 7 plus years old, both the Father and Mother continued to be jointly involved in the care and upbringing of their Daughter. Under the Existing Consent Orders, they had agreed to joint custody, care and control of the Daughter in 2015 and they continued to do so in September 2017, with agreed living arrangements where the Daughter spent about equal time under each parent’s care. Currently, this was vide alternate week arrangements with each parent, where she would stay with them at their respective condominium units. In addition, the Daughter was also having dinner access on one weekday night with the other parent. Both the Father and the Mother were presently caregivers of the Daughter and the Daughter was benefiting from the nurturing presence and joint contributions of both parents in her life.

24     The terms of the Existing Consent Orders showed that both parties had agreed to work together as good co-parents in the upbringing of their Daughter, with her best interests in mind. Paragraph 3(b) in the first consent order dated 28 December 2015 provided as follows:

> _“b_      **_The parties shall co-operate and have a mutually agreeable care arrangement for the child so that both parties will be involved in the child’s life._** _No access shall be exercised in the presence of \[xx\]. The family maid shall accompany the child to assist in her care when the child moves between the Plaintiff’s and the Defendant’s home”_

> _(emphasis is mine)_

25     Later, in the second consent order dated 15 September 2017, the following terms were included (further to paragraph 3b above):

> _“(i_)     _With effect from 15 September 2017, the child of the marriage (“the Child”) shall reside with each party for an alternating 4-5 continuous days, as suggested by the counsellor XX. Parties to arrange the specific 4 -5 continuous days_ **_by mutual consent_** _._

> (_ii_)   _With effect from 3 November 2017, the Child shall reside with each party during alternate weeks, from Friday after school continuously to the next Friday before school. Parties are at liberty to change the start date of this arrangement_, **_if in the Child’s best interests, by mutual consent_**_. Parties are also at liberty to make occasional changes to this alternating week arrangement due to work and vacation_, **_by mutual consent_**_._

> (_iii_)   _Parties agree to evaluate the Child’s living arrangements as set out at \[(a) (ii)\] above every 6 months and to make adjustments_, **_if in the Child’s best interest, by mutual consent_**_.”_

26     It should be noted that it was only in September 2017 that the Mother had withdrawn the 2017 London Relocation Application and had agreed with the Father, after consultation with a private psychologist, to the above caregiving arrangements and these were made to accommodate the Daughter’s request for a longer stay with each parent at each time. This was about 8 months prior to the filing of the Relocation Application in May 2018.

27     The Mother claimed that the parties’ intended joint parenting was not working well and that the Daughter did not appear to be thriving in her current ‘transient’ environment in Singapore (living within the expatriate community). She was of the view that the Daughter needed long-term stability and permanence of the type that only Mauritius could offer her (given the close network of family and friends living there). This was set out in her affidavit (M1) as one key reason for her relocation and why the relocation was in the best interests of the Daughter.

28     On the issue of whether the parties were co-parenting well under the agreed caregiving arrangements, I agreed with the Father’s counsel that it was important to consider what the Mother was now alleging in her affidavits for the Relocation Application against the parties’ email exchanges from the second half of 2017 and into 2018 as the latter constituted primary (contemporaneous) evidence of their collaboration as parents at the relevant time and would show whether the existing agreed arrangements were working well or properly during the relevant period.

29     The Father admitted that he had said mean things to the Mother earlier on as he was still angry and hurt over the affair that she had had with his friend (who was not **F**) which had destroyed their marriage and their life together as a family, but such anger and hurt had lessened over time. He contended that since the middle of 2017, he and the Mother had been working well together on the caregiving arrangements for the Daughter.

30     Having read through the parties’ email exchanges (from 2017) which were exhibited in their affidavits, I was of the view that whilst they still had some conflicts along the way (over their failed marriage and how each had hurt the other), their love, concern and care for their Daughter was apparent in many ways. I found that, on the whole, these exchanges showed that the parties were communicating and working well together on the caregiving arrangements for the Daughter. They were flexible and easily accommodated changes to the arrangements and there was that mutuality and respect for each other’s position. This was evident in their exchanges from July 2017.[^1]

31     It should also be noted that parties had leased condominium units within close proximity of each other (walking distance of less than 200m) in order to facilitate their joint care of the Daughter_._ They also shared the services of their full time domestic maid **M** who currently moved between each of their households to help them with the care of the Daughter. **M** was with them before their divorce - when the Daughter was about 13 months old and had helped to take care of the Daughter for the past 5 years.

32     There was no evidence before me and indeed it was not the Mother’s case that the Father was not fulfilling his maintenance obligations for the Daughter, or that he was not complying with the orders relating to the parties’ joint custody, care and control of the Daughter.

33     Further, I noted that the Mother was also _not_ applying for any variation of the Existing Consent Orders in the event that the Relocation Application was not allowed. This was telling in my view and consistent with the position that she was not dissatisfied with these agreed arrangements which were working and flexible.

34     All considered, I was of the view that the agreed arrangements under the Existing Consent Orders worked to maximize the time spent by the Daughter with each parent and the parents in turn were making very good efforts to co-ordinate these arrangements, in the best interests of their Daughter.

35     Next, I considered the Mother’s claims concerning the Daughter’s emotional and developmental needs (which she stated could only be met by moving to Mauritius), the Daughter’s own deep desire to live in Mauritius with her extended family and friends and the Daughter’s relationship with her and the Father.

36     On this point, I also noted the independent observations and assessments in the SIR that the existing agreed arrangements had allowed both parents to play their complementary parental roles in the Daughter’s development and that the Daughter, on her part had also adapted well to the family transition and arrangements.

37     It was also reported in the SIR that the Daughter was coping well in her international school in Singapore as well (she was at Grade 2 in August 2018) and got along with her peers and that overall, the Daughter was an articulate and happy child with minimal impact from the divorce. Indeed, it was noted that the Daughter’s stable development was a testament to responsive parenting and caregiving by both parents.

38     As for the Daughter’s relationship with her parents, it was clear from the evidence filed and the SIR, that the Daughter shared a warm, loving and close relationship with both parents. I noted in particular the following observations in the SIR which reflected the Daughter’s wishes and the extent of her love for both her parents:

> (a)     that because she loved her Father as much as her Mother, she would miss one whenever she was with the other (not just during the alternating week arrangement but also during holidays away with one parent), and

> (b)     that she wanted to be together with them and she would be deeply affected if she could not live with them.

> And, as for the Mother’s claim that the Daughter had said that she wished to live in Mauritius with her extended family and friends, I noted that the Daughter did _not_ express this desire when she was interviewed about her wishes for the preparation of the SIR.

39     Based on the evidence before me, I did not doubt that the Father was an active and involved father in the Daughter’s life and wanted the best for the Daughter. It was clear that he was justifiably concerned with the long-term development of his only child and he did not wish to be excluded from the important life decisions concerning her. That the Daughter was his priority could be seen clearly in his email reply of 17 January 2017 to the Mother when she first informed him of her wish to relocate to London (because of an attractive offer she had received from her (employer) bank): [^2]

> _“I am happy to discuss (as I am with anything that concerns \[Daughter\]_

> _I need to manage your expectations however as nothing has changed since before Xmas – namely:_

>> _\-_      _Neither of us will get to see \[her\] as much as we do today if we move back to UK and she is coming into an age (as you know) where she needs love, affection and most importantly time from both parents_

>> _\-_      _\[She\] is only 5 and has had a very rough start to life, in my mind the disruption due to the displacement for her will be vast at this stage in her life_

>> _\-_      _London is a large and sometimes dangerous city and as we had always agreed, not somewhere that is ideal/desirable to bring up kids – what has changed?_

>> (I)     _…_

> _I do understand why the obvious thing for you to want is to leave Singapore and your work situation obviously adds pressure to move. But my belief that staying here is the best thing for \[Daughter\] at this stage in her life is exactly that, she’s in a top school, she has lots of friends and is a very happy secure and content little girl – why would we want to risk losing that?_

> _I understand you like your current bank and I’m genuinely sorry that the roles are being offshored (same pressure here) – but I really don’t know why you wouldn’t start to look for a role at another bank/org where you can be paid more and have a better pension etc? I had spent months and years trying to convince you that there are any number of jobs ‘out there’ in Singapore and it’s not really my place to do so again now, but it really is true. I am happy to hear your side/proposal but I just don’t see how it will change the reality that I am facing._

> _As I’ve also said a number of things, my ‘desire’ for \[Daughter\] and I to stay in Singapore is in no way driven by a vendetta towards you or anyone else. It’s about \[Daughter\] first, finances second and you and I last.”_

40     As the Father and Daughter have presently a strong, loving and close relationship and the Father played an active role in her life, this father and daughter relationship would clearly be adversely impacted should the proposed relocation to Mauritius be allowed – with the physical separation and the significant diminution of their time spent together (in comparison to what they have now together under the agreed arrangements). I agreed with the Father’s submission that the next 5 to 8 years of the Daughter’s life were possibly the most important years for her in terms of growing up, establishing her moral and value framework; and for this, it would be of critical importance that the Father (and not just the Mother) continued to be actively involved in the Daughter’s development during this period. Further, as the Daughter was still relatively young (7 to 8 years old at the time of the hearing), her capacity for long-term memory was still at an early stage of development. Any physical separation might affect the consolidation of her positive experiences of being cared for and loved by the Father as well as by the Mother and positive experiences of love and care were important in her growth and emotional development from a child to an adolescent. Therefore, in my view, for the Daughter, at this young age, it would be in her best interests that she continued with the current status quo and continued to have that personal physical contact and frequent interaction with both her parents. As was observed by the High Court in _BNT v BNS_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 859</span> at \[21\]:

> _“… the court must bear in mind that, in general, it is in the child’s interests for him to continue to have a meaningful relationship with both his mother and his father notwithstanding that the relationship between the parents has broken down. The Court of Appeal in CX v CY <span class="citation">\[2005\] 3 SLR(R) 690</span> observed at \[26\] that “the welfare of a child is best secured by letting him enjoy the love, care and support of both parents”. The understanding is that a child will feel more secure if both his parents continue to be involved in his life: BG v BF <span class="citation">\[2007\] 3 SLR(R) 233</span> at \[13\]. Although these comments were made in the context of joint custody orders in CX v CY and access orders in BG v BF, I consider them relevant in the context of relocation applications as well.”_

And, at \[35(c)\] of the same case:

> _“ … With younger children, closeness is promoted by physical contact and frequent interaction in routine activities. Telephone and internet access are frequently unsatisfactory due to technical difficulties and generally permit only one type of interaction: conversation. Normal family life consists of much more than conversations between parent and child- there are joint activities, routines, projects, discipline and learning from the examples set by the parents in all sorts of situations.”_

41     Given the above reasons, I was therefore not persuaded that the Daughter’s current situation was such that the Daughter had to be relocated to Mauritius for her ‘emotional well-being’. The Daughter was growing up well and she was happy and in a stable, safe and happy living environment in Singapore where she was enjoying the love, care and attention of both her parents. She was also settled in her international school and was doing well there and enjoying the many friendships formed in school as well as outside. The international school that she was attending was a very reputable and renowned school in Singapore and worldwide, and the Daughter could progress within the same school up to the International Baccalaureate Diploma. Both parents had decided on this international school for the Daughter together. As they also wanted the Daughter to be effectively bilingual in English and French, the Daughter was currently also taking private French lessons.

42     Second, whilst much was made by the Mother of how much the Daughter loved Mauritius and was familiar with it, I noted that the Daughter has lived all her life in Singapore and Singapore is the only home she has known. As for Mauritius, it was not disputed that the Daughter had only been there for holiday visits and she would therefore have memories of Mauritius only as a holiday destination. In fact, based on the Mother’s affidavit (M4), as of 8 August 2018, the Mother and Daughter had only visited Mauritius in the last 4 years as follows:

> (a)     2018 - 14 days;

> (b)     2017 - 24 days (comprising 2 visits); and

> (c)     2016 - 24 days (comprising 2 visits), and

> (d)     2015 - 6 ½ weeks (comprising 3 visits of about 2 weeks each, the Daughter was only 4 years old then).

43     Further, I noted in the SIR that the Daughter had expressed her contentment with the existing status quo and had not expressed any desire to move to Mauritius. Notwithstanding this, I was mindful that given her tender age, the Daughter might not have the sufficient maturity to decide on major issues like relocation for herself.

44     I also noted that there was no lack of financial provision by the Father for the Daughter. The Father and the Mother had come to an agreement in September 2017 (under the same consent order when the 2017 London Relocation Application was withdrawn) on the amount of maintenance to be provided by the Father for the Daughter and Mother. This was not an insubstantial sum. The Father was to continue paying for all the Daughter’s international school fees and medical expenses and he was also to continue providing a monthly sum of $4,500 to the Mother as maintenance for herself and the Daughter. As I understood it, this monthly sum of $4,500 included the Father’s substantial contribution towards the rental payable for the Mother’s condominium unit. They were to continue sharing their maid’s expenses equally. They were also to share the cost of the Daughter’s private French lessons equally.

45     In addition, I had also considered whether the Mother’s reasons for relocation (summarised in paragraph 16 above) were reasonable. The Mother’s case was that there was no intention by either party to reside permanently in Singapore. She on her part had always considered Mauritius as her home. Whilst she acknowledged that the Daughter currently enjoyed a safe and stable living environment in Singapore, circumstances had changed now in that there was nothing left for her here anymore. She had to think for her own future and for the Daughter (who would have to relocate with one of the parents at some point in time and it was only a question of “when” and not “if”). And it was in the best interests of the Daughter that the Mother had made the Relocation Application now, to return to the country of her birth where all her family and close friends were.

46     I noted that whilst the Mother claimed that Mauritius was her home and that there was no intention to reside in Singapore permanently, the fact remained that she had not been residing in Mauritius since she left in 1999 although she had returned on visits for holidays. By the end of 2018, the Mother had been away from Mauritius for _19 years_; and more than half of this period of 19 years was spent in Singapore (10½ years). As for the Father, he had spent in total about _20 years_ in Singapore by the end of 2018, if one included his growing up years. As for the Daughter, she had grown up in Singapore. In these circumstances, it was not surprising or unbelievable for the Father and Daughter to have regarded Singapore as their home and for the Father to have built up through his years in Singapore an extensive network of friends here who could be relied upon for some solid support. As for the Mother, she had also been working in Singapore in the banking industry for about 7 years out of her 10½ years here. As such, I was not inclined to believe her evidence that she was completely isolated and without any support network of friends and colleagues in Singapore.

47     The Mother also made extensive submissions that the living environment that the Daughter would enjoy in Mauritius (including the available education there) was not inferior to that currently enjoyed by the Daughter in Singapore. On this point, I must add that any decision for the relocation of a child was not intended to be a simple qualitative comparison between the existing country that the child was living in and the country in which she was to be relocated to. The living environment in the new country was but one factor to be considered in determining what was in the welfare of the child.

48     I also noted that it was only in April 2017 that the Mother had filed the 2017 London Relocation Application, and for that application, the Mother stated that it was also in the best interests of the Daughter to relocate to London. And in 2016, the Mother had also suggested a relocation to Hong Kong and then she also stated that it was in the best interests of the Daughter to relocate to Hong Kong. On each of these 2 occasions, it would appear that the trigger for the proposed move was because her existing employer (“**Bank X**”) had offered her positions in these locations. The Mother was apprehensive of being made redundant in Singapore if she did not take up these offers (as she claimed that she was told by the bank then in 2016 that this would be most likely as Bank X would be relocating most of its activities to Hong Kong and Europe and Bank X would be making Hong Kong its Asian headquarters and downsizing its Singapore office).

49     It should be noted that on these 2 occasions in 2016 and 2017, even though the Mother did not proceed further to take up the positions offered in Hong Kong and in London, she was not made redundant but had continued to be employed by Bank X for its Singapore office and was still so employed by Bank X at the time of the hearings before me in 2018 and 2019.

50     Indeed, there was also no evidence (from Bank X) before me to substantiate the Mother’s continued claims that her job in the Singapore office was a temporary position and that she would most likely be made redundant.

51     Hence, although the Mother had repeatedly expressed her concerns of her job security in Singapore as an expatriate, she has remained gainfully employed by the same Bank X since 2014. And, whilst she had also complained of there being little or no progression in her career with Bank X, her average (take-home) monthly salary in 2018 was about $9,000. In addition, she also received an agreed maintenance sum of $4,500 every month for herself and the Daughter from the Father. The Mother was, as such, quite comfortable financially. I further noted that the Mother was very well qualified (with an undergraduate and postgraduate degree in Economics and Finance). In 2017, she was so well-regarded by Bank X that the position that was offered to her in its London branch was as the second in charge, heading a team of 10 or 12 persons to oversee the bank’s French and Swiss-based clients. Given her qualifications and years of experience in the banking industry, I was not persuaded by her submission that she would not be able to find other suitable employment in Singapore even if she was asked to leave her current job.

52     All considered, I was therefore not persuaded that the Mother’s reasons for relocating at this juncture were compelling. Her wish to relocate was very much a matter of choice on her part.

53     For all the reasons set out above, I dismissed the Mother’s application for leave to relocate the Daughter to Mauritius. On the issue of costs, I ordered the Mother to pay the Father fixed costs of $10,000 (all in, inclusive of all disbursements) after hearing submissions, taking into account the volume of work done, the number of case conferences and the 4 half-day hearings.
