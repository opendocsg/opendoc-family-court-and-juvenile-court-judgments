Family Law - Personal Protection Order – section 65 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353)

30 November 2019

### District Judge Cheryl Koh:

## A.    Introduction

1       SS No. 2720 of 2018 is an application by the complainant husband (the “**Husband**”) for a personal protection order (“**PPO**”) against the respondent wife (the “**Wife**”), in favour of himself and their two children (the “**Children**”). On 20 March 2019, he withdrew the application for a PPO for himself and proceeded on only the PPO for the Children.

2       On 30 August 2019, I dismissed the Husband’s application. The Husband has appealed.

3       Essentially, I found that the Husband has not proven on a balance of probabilities that:

> (a)     the Wife had tried to kill herself by attempting to throw herself off the balcony of their residence (the “**Matrimonial Home**”) on 26 July 2018; and

> (b)     the Wife had further tried to kill herself and the Children by attempting to throw herself and the Children off the balcony of the Matrimonial Home on 16 September 2018,

such that family violence had been committed on the Children and a PPO is necessary for their protection.

## B.    Background facts

#### Parties

4       Parties were married in Punjab, Pakistan on 31 October 212. Both parties are Muslim. Parties are distant relatives[^1] and knew each other since young[^2], and had an arranged marriage[^3].

5       The Husband is a British citizen and is of Pakistani descent. He is currently 33 years old. Since 2011, he has been working as the Chief Operating Officer for a company in Singapore dealing with investment and asset management. He is also a director in the company[^4]. There are related offices in Hong Kong, Abu Dhabi, London and Tokyo[^5], and his father works in the London office[^6]. The Husband’s net worth is at least $5 million.[^7] He is on an employment pass in Singapore.

6       The Wife is a Pakistani citizen and a homemaker. She is currently 36 years old. Until it was cancelled by the Husband’s company on 20 December 2018, the Wife was on a dependant’s pass in Singapore.

7       Immediately after marriage, the Husband brought the Wife to live with him in Singapore. The Children are two (2) boys born in 2014 and 2016, aged five (5) and two (2) years old. They shall be referred to herein as “**_A_**” and “**_B_**” respectively. The Children are British citizens.

#### Legal proceedings

8       On 20 September 2018, the Husband filed for a PPO against the Wife, in favour of himself and the Children, primarily based on two alleged incidents where the Wife had tried to kill herself on 26 July 2018, and further tried to kill herself and the Children on 16 September 2018. He also relied on the Wife’s past alleged threats to kill herself and the Children.

9       On 20 September 2018, the Husband left the Matrimonial Home with the Children. Till todate, the Wife remains alone in the Matrimonial Home. Parties have since filed multiple applications in the Family Court and the Syariah Court:

> (a)     on 19 September 2018, the Husband filed an Originating Summons in the Family Court to have care and control of the Children. He also filed an application for an injunction for the Wife to handover the Children to the Husband. On 25 September 2018, interim orders were made by the Family Court that neither party is to remove the Children from Singapore and that the Children not be removed from their current residence with the Husband;

> (b)     on 15 October 2018, the Wife filed an Originating Summons in the Family Court to have _inter alia_ sole custody, care and control of the Children and to relocate with the Children to the United Kingdom (“**UK**”). The Wife subsequently also filed an application to set aside the injunction;

> (c)     on 26 November 2018, the Husband commenced divorce proceedings in the Syariah Court;

> (d)     on 11 December 2018, the Husband filed an application in the Syariah Court for leave to bring the Children out of Singapore. The Wife also filed an application for leave from the Syariah Court to continue with proceedings in the Family Court; and

> (e)     on 14 February 2019, the Wife filed a MSS application in the Family Court for interim maintenance for herself.

10     On 20 December 2018, the Husband’s company cancelled the Wife’s dependent pass[^8]. Both parties have since withdrawn their Originating Summonses in the Family Court, as the Syariah Court will now deal with all issues relating to the Children. In the meantime, the Husband agreed to let the Wife have access to the Children twice to thrice weekly, supervised by the Husband.

#### Summary of parties’ positions

11     The Husband’s version of events in relation to the incidents of alleged violence is set out in his affidavit (affirmed on 19 September 2018), as follows:-

> Past history of alleged violence

> (a)     since October 2012, the Wife has been instigating arguments and raising her dissatisfaction, mostly about money issues. During these arguments, the Wife became aggressive and uncontrollable;

> (b)     during the first year of marriage, the Wife took an iron and used it to hit her head. On another occasion, the Wife wrapped the iron cord around her neck and tried to strangle herself;

> (c)     in 2014, whilst pregnant with A, the Wife often threatened to leave the Husband, kill herself and the unborn child;

> (d)     after A was born in 2014, the Wife later demanded for more money, saying she would kill herself;

> (e)     whilst pregnant with B, sometime in September 2016, the Husband came home and found the Wife holding a knife. She threatened to kill herself and the second unborn child if he did not transfer her brother the sum of $30,000.00. The Husband hence transferred the said sum to her brother;

> (f)     after B was born, the Wife demanded that the Husband transfer money to her sister. If he refused, she threatened to kill herself and the Children. The Wife’s sister eventually said she did not require the money;

> (g)     from May to June 2018, the Husband travelled for work and the Wife threatened to abscond with the Children such that he would not be able to find them again;

> (h)     from July 2018, the Wife woke the Husband up in the middle of the night and repeated her threats to kill herself and the Children;

> 26 July 2018 incident

> (i)     on 26 July 2018, the Wife demanded the Husband book a one-way ticket to Pakistan for her, and intended to leave the Children in Singapore;

> (j)     when the Husband showed the Wife the ticket, she grabbed it and screamed at him for wanting her to leave. The Wife ran upstairs to the balcony. As he thought she was going to jump off, he woke the domestic helper up and told her that the Wife was on the second floor. The domestic helper ran to the second floor to check on the Wife and the Husband checked on the Children. He then went upstairs and saw the Wife standing on the ledge of the balcony. He tried to reason with her and after much pleading, the Wife calmed down and returned to the apartment;

> (k)     the Husband initially referred to this incident having taken place on 31 July 2018 in his affidavit. He amended the date to 26 July 2018, after the Wife pointed out in her reply affidavit that no such incident could have happened as parties and the Children were in fact in the UK on 31 July 2018; and

> 16 September 2018 incident

> (l)     on 16 September 2018, the Wife threatened to kill the Children again. The Husband was holding B and their domestic helper was feeding A. The Wife pulled A out of the domestic helper’s hands and grabbed B from the Husband, and dragged them towards the second floor. As she was rushing up, the Wife repeatedly told the Husband she was going to jump down with the Children. The Husband and the domestic helper managed to save the Children, and the Husband told the domestic helper to take the Children and keep them in the room until the Wife came to her senses. The Wife continued to scream at the Husband, threatening to kill herself and blaming him for everything.

12     The Wife’s version of events is set out in her affidavit affirmed on 18 December 2018, as follows:-

> Past history of alleged violence

> (a)     the Wife denied that she has been instigating arguments and raising dissatisfaction about money issues. Rather, her concerns had to do with the Husband’s behaviour, namely, about him not being a family-oriented man and enjoying a “bachelor” lifestyle, coming home late after work and not even speaking to or seeing the Children and her. He would spend at least four nights a week out with his friends. He would come home reeking of cigarettes and alcohol, and head straight to the spare room. The Husband has also always been quick to dismiss the Wife’s views regarding the Children’s needs. He ridiculed and belittled the Wife, and was paranoid that she would leave him for someone else. She denied trying to harm herself, attempt suicide, or harm the Children;

> (b)     she denied being suicidal during her pregnancy with A. If she were indeed suicidal, the Husband or a family member accompanying her for medical check-ups would alert the relevant medical professionals so that the Wife could seek help. She never had issues with money and it is in fact the Husband who enjoyed showing off to people that he is well-off;

> (c)     it was the Husband who voluntarily gave the sum of $30,000.00 to her brother. He knew that her brother was looking to open a new business back then and he gave the monies to him to help him out in that aspect;

> (d)     since July 2018, the Husband had been travelling frequently and there were only a few days when the parties were under one roof, let alone sleeping in the same bed. In fact, since around February 2018, parties have not been sleeping in the same bed. The Husband started to sleep in a separate room from November 2017 onwards. In July till August 2018, parties and the Children were in the UK. The Wife and the Children stayed with the Wife’s sister, and the Husband would only stay for a couple of nights. It is therefore incredulous for the Husband to allege that the Wife would wake him up “_every other night_” to threaten to kill herself and the Children, when they were not even under the same roof;

> 26 July 2018 incident

> (e)     the Wife explained in her affidavit that no incident took place at all on 31 July 2018 and she was in the UK at the time. After the Husband amended the date of the alleged incident to 26 July 2018, the Wife maintained that no such incident took place. She produced evidence at the trial that B was ill on that day, and the Wife had taken him to see the doctor and was nursing him the whole night. The Husband had slept in a separate guest room; and

> 16 September 2018 incident

> (f)     on 16 September 2018, the Husband had just returned from the UK after a full week of travel for his work. The Wife had prepared dinner for the entire family, as she usually does, and on that day, she made lasagne which was his favourite dish;

> (g)     the Husband sat down to eat, however, he immediately vomitted onto his plate;

> (h)     the Wife was shocked and immediately rushed to his care. She presumed he was drinking on the flight back;

> (i)     the Wife cleaned up the mess and started feeding A. Whilst doing so, the Husband started smoking in the apartment. She believed he did so in an attempt to provoke her as he knew that she did not like him smoking or drinking in the apartment;

> (j)     the Wife stopped feeding A and asked the Husband to stop smoking in the apartment and asked him to smoke outside instead, as the smoke affected A’s breathing;

> (k)     when the Husband became agitated, the Wife brought the Children into the bathroom and locked the door from inside. She wanted a safe environment in case he became aggressive; and

> (l)     the Wife came out of the toilet about 15 minutes later, she saw that he was already sleeping in the spare room with the same clothes he had on. She did not disturb him so that he would sleep off his drunken state. She brought the Children to the main bedroom where she breastfed B. They both slept with her that night.

#### Parties’ affidavits and submissions

13     Parties have filed the following affidavits, exhibits and submissions herein:

> (a)     the Husband’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief affirmed on 19 September 2018, admitted and marked as “**C1**”;

> (b)     the Husband’s reply affidavit affirmed on 24 January 2019, admitted and marked as “**C2**”;

> (c)     the affidavit of the Husband’s domestic helper affirmed on 2 October 2018, admitted and marked as “**C3**”;

> (d)     the domestic helper’s markings in the photo of the living room in the Matrimonial Home, admitted and marked as “**C4**”;

> (e)     the Wife’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief affirmed on 18 December 2018, admitted and marked as “**R1**”;

> (f)     the Wife’s reply affidavit affirmed on 17 January 2019, admitted and marked as “**R2**”;

> (g)     the Wife’s WhatsApp messages, admitted and marked as “**R3**”;

> (h)     letter from Vinit Chhabra Law Corporation, admitted and marked as “**R4**”;

> (i)     the Wife’s police report dated 20 September 2018, admitted and marked as “**R5**”;

> (j)     the Wife’s police report dated 29 October 2018, admitted and marked as “**R6**”;

> (k)     the Husband’s Closing Submissions; and

> (l)     the Wife’s Closing Submissions.

14     The Husband had one witness, namely, his domestic helper XXX who was present in the Matrimonial Home on 26 July and 16 September 2018. The Husband also subpoenaed the Wife’s witness, Dr. XXX, a forensic psychologist who had examined the Wife on 27 September 2018. The Wife had no witnesses.

15     It is noteworthy for the purpose of costs considerations that the Husband had made an open offer to withdraw the PPO at the start of the trial, provided the Wife gave an undertaking not to commit family violence on the Children, and such undertaking would be without admission to the allegations made herein and without prejudice to the Syariah Court proceedings. Unfortunately, the Wife was not prepared to provide any form of undertaking. The PPO proceedings therefore proceeded.

## C.    Grounds of Decision

### The law

16     Section 65(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353) states as follows:

> _“65.—(1_)     _The court may, upon satisfaction on a balance of probabilities that family violence has been committed or is likely to be committed against a family member and that it is necessary for the protection of the family member, make a protection order restraining the person against whom the order is made from using family violence against the family member.”_

17     “Family violence” is defined in section 64 of the Women’s Charter to mean the commission of any of the following acts:

> (a)     wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;

> (b)     causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;

> (c)     wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his will; or

> (d)     causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member,

but does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age.

18     It is trite that there are two limbs to be satisfied for the grant of a PPO: _first_, that an act of violence has been committed in the past or that there is a likelihood of its occurrence in the future and _second_, it is necessary for the protection of the family member that an order be made: _AMT v AMV_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGDC 14</span> at \[18\].

19     In my judgment, the Husband has failed on a balance of probabilities to prove that the Wife has committed family violence on the Children and that a PPO is necessary for the protection of the Children. For ease of understanding, I shall deal with each of the alleged incidents of violence chronologically.

### Past incidents of alleged violence

20     In my view, due to the unsatisfactory evidence presented, the Husband has failed to prove that the Wife had committed past incidents of violence by threatening to kill herself and the Children.

21      _First_, the Husband’s case is that since marriage, the Wife has been dissatisfied about money issues, which thus led her to make frequent demands for money and issue threats to kill herself and the Children. He was however unable to show that the Wife was a mercenary money-grubber who would threaten to kill over money. In this regard, the Husband conceded under cross-examination that initial quarrels between parties were in fact not about money[^9]. Instead, the Wife’s unhappiness was over that he did not spend enough time with her, often went drinking and for massages with friends, came home late at night, and slept in the guest room separate from the Wife.[^10] The Husband further conceded that parties had a “_harmonious”_ relationship when it came to money and the Wife never had to worry about not having enough for her use[^11]. In fact, the Wife never had her own bank account, credit card or ATM card throughout the marriage. The Husband would give her cash every week and in the past year and a half or so, he had let her use his credit card where he would top up money if needed[^12]. The Wife would even message him before she used his card,[^13] and declined to open her own bank account[^14]. The Husband’s testimony under cross-examination showed that the Wife remained financially reliant on the Husband in a “_harmonious_” fashion and did not seek financial independence from him, which belies the Husband’s attempts to paint the Wife as coveting and avaricious for money.

22      _Second_, the Husband alleged that the Wife had made numerous threats to kill herself and the Children over money throughout the entire marriage from 2012 till 2018, and even kicked, slapped and punched him on these occasions. He however accepted that he has never lodged a police report, never sought medical treatment for any physical hurt, never taken any photographs or videos of the alleged incidents,[^15] and never reported any incidents to social services[^16]. The neighbours have also never called the police about any noise such as shouting or screaming coming from the Matrimonial Home[^17]. The Wife has never caused any physical injuries to him and the Children that were of concern[^18]. He also did not mention any kicking, slapping and punching by the Wife in his affidavit.[^19] He continued to travel for work at least half of each year[^20] and left all matters relating to the Children and the household to the Wife[^21]. He testified that the Wife “_was a good mother, she was caring, she even looked after me very well_”. His testimony under cross-examination is not consistent with his evidence on affidavit that the Wife is an aggressive and uncontrollable person who repeatedly threatened to kill over money.

23      _Third_, the domestic helper’s evidence in her affidavit is that the Wife left the care of the Children to her, frequently shouted and screamed in front of the Children, which later escalated to threats where the Wife repeatedly told the Husband that she would kill herself. She said it was because the Wife suspected the Husband of having affairs. However, under cross-examination, the domestic helper accepted that the Wife was the main caregiver of the Children[^22] and a good mother[^23] who looked after the Children well. The domestic helper further conceded that parties only spoke in their own language, Punjabi, which she did not understand. She therefore could not have understood the Wife as saying that she would kill herself, or have any first-hand knowledge of the contents of parties’ marital issues. Incredulously, she testified that she knew that the Wife thought the Husband was having affairs because for a singular time and for a singular sentence, the Wife spoke in the English language instead of Punjabi and said that “_You have cheated on me. And you are f\*\*\*ing other women_.[^24]”

24      _Fourth_, as to the Husband’s allegation that the Wife had tried to strangle herself with an iron cord in the first year of marriage in 2012, the Husband accepted he did not bring the Wife to seek medical attention or call for police help on this alleged incident[^25]. He testified that he had called his mother and she had advised him that this was normal behaviour. He however did not mention this conversation with his mother in his affidavit[^26] and in any event, it would be quite incredible for his mother to advise him that it would be normal for someone to strangle herself.

25      _Fifth_, as for the Husband’s allegation that he had transferred $30,000.00 to the Wife’s brother in September 2016 because she had held a knife to herself, the Husband accepted that the transfer slip did not in fact show that the Wife had in fact threatened to kill herself and the unborn child. The Wife’s evidence is that the Husband had transferred the monies to her brother to help him to open a new business back then. That the transfer slip states the monies transferred were a “_gift_” for the Wife’s brother is consistent with the Wife’s evidence.

26      _Sixth_, despite these alleged incidents of the Wife strangling herself in 2012, threatening to kill the unborn child A in 2014 and to kill the unborn child B in 2016, it is difficult to accept that the Husband could testify that he had no reason to be believe that there was anything majorly wrong with her prior to March 2018[^27]. Indeed, notwithstanding these alleged repeated threats to kill herself and the Children, the Husband could even conceive a third child with the Wife in November 2017 (whom she unfortunately later miscarried). He also left the Children with the Wife and went to watch the World Cup in Russia and the French open tennis in France in May and June 2018 for work[^28]. Between April 2018 and September 2018 (for a period of about 150 days), the Husband spent 86 days away from the Wife and the Children. The Husband was clearly not concerned about the Children’s safety with the Wife.

27      _Seventh_, with regard to the Husband’s allegations that the Wife had made threats to abscond with the Children when he was away for work in May and June 2018, the Husband accepted that the Wife’s mother was in fact sick in Singapore during that time. The Wife had to attend to her mother in hospital and even spent overnights with her there. She also looked after her mother in the Matrimonial Home after her mother’s discharge. It would be quite illogical that the Wife would threaten to abscond with the Children and abandon her sick mother alone in Singapore. Indeed, the Husband himself conceded that he did not think that the Wife would carry out any threats to abscond with the Children as she was busy looking after her mother[^29].

28      _Eighth_, as to the Husband’s allegation that from July 2018 the Wife would wake him up in the middle of the night every other night and repeat her threats to kill herself and the Children, he agreed that the Wife in fact slept with B every night as B was still breastfeeding[^30] and the Husband slept in a separate guest room[^31]. It was quite illogical that the Wife would leave B and come to the Husband’s room, threaten to kill herself and the Children, and then return to her room to sleep with B. Further, the Husband accepted that on 20 July 2018, the Wife took B with her to send her mother back to Pakistan and returned with B only on 24 July 2018[^32]. If the Wife was threatening to kill the Children every other night in July 2018, it would be rather incredible that he allowed the Wife to bring B alone back to Pakistan in the same month. The Husband further alleged that the Wife began to threaten to kill A first claiming the Husband loved A more, and yet it is difficult to accept that at this stage, he did not believe she would carry out her repeated threats even though they were happening every other night and did not seek professional help for her[^33].

29      _Finally_, the Husband accepted that the Wife regularly took the Children for their doctor appointments throughout the years, and he sometimes accompanied them for these visits. These doctors included a paediatrician at Paragon Centre, an allergy specialist at Mount Alvernia Medical Centre and the Wife’s gynaecologist. He had never raised any mental health issues about the Wife to these doctors. Further, none of these doctors had ever alerted him that the Wife was mentally unstable or not taking proper care of the Children[^34]. In fact, he accepted that she was a caring and devoted mother who faithfully followed up on the Children’s attendance with the doctors[^35].

30     Given the totality of the evidence, I was thus unable to find that the Husband has discharged his burden of proof on a balance of probabilities to show that the Wife had committed past family violence.

### 26 July 2018 incident

31     In my judgment, the Husband has also failed to prove that the Wife had threatened to kill herself on 26 July 2018, due to the inconsistent and contradictory evidence presented.

32      _First_, the Husband initially gave evidence in his affidavit that the alleged incident happened on 31 July 2018. After the Wife pointed out that parties and the Children were in the UK on 31 July 2018, the Husband changed his evidence and said that it took place on 26 July 2018. He explained that he had thought it was on 31 July 2018 because his father had asked him to bring forward the travel date from the original departure date of 01 August 2018 to 27 July 2018. The domestic helper also made the exact same error as the Husband in stating that the date of the alleged incident was 31 July 2018, only to change it to 26 July 2018. Interestingly, she gave evidence that the Husband was beside her for an hour when she was doing her affidavit. The Wife then produced a WhatsApp message dated 19 August 2018 evidencing that parties’ intended travel date was always on 27 July 2018. The Husband then changed his evidence and said that it was correct that the original departure was on 27 July 2018, but after the alleged incident he had changed it to 01 August 2018 and his father then asked him to change it back to 27 July 2018. No documentary evidence was however presented on these ticket changes. Whilst the Husband produced a ticket with a travel date of 01 August 2018 from Singapore to the UK, the Wife testified that the Husband was always making ticket changes due to his work demands and these changes are paid for by his company, and he could have done the same this time[^36].

33      _Second_, the Husband testified that when the Wife wanted to commit suicide, he went to wake the domestic helper up to ask her to attend to the Wife. If time was indeed of the essence, the Husband would not have gone to wake the domestic helper up to attend to the Wife; he ought to have naturally attended to her. The domestic helper testified that it was because the Wife needed a woman to be with her, but the Wife’s evidence is that she was not close to the domestic helper and did not share personal issues with her, hence it is inconceivable that the domestic helper’s presence could have assisted the Wife. The Husband further testified that after he arrived back up to the second storey, he sent the domestic helper downstairs, and spent 5 to 10 minutes to persuade the Wife to come off the balcony. The Wife however refused to go downstairs, and hence he spent half an hour to 40 minutes up there. However, the domestic helper testified that she was not downstairs but was watching from the lift at the second storey, and parties only spoke about for 20 minutes until the Wife calmed down and the domestic helper went back to sleep. She subsequently testified that she did not in fact know how long the alleged incident took[^37].

34      _Third_, the Wife’s evidence is that she had accompanied her mother back to Pakistan on 20 July 2018 and returned to Singapore on 24 July 2018. The Wife had taken B along with her on the trip, as she was still breast-feeding B. The Husband does not dispute this. After the return from Pakistan, B was ill and on 26 July 2018, the Wife brought B to see the doctor. The doctor prescribed antibiotics and she had to nurse him that whole night. This is evidenced by B’s health booklet and medical memo[^38] produced by the Wife during the trial. In this regard, the Husband accepted that Wife would have brought the Children to the doctor before travel to the UK and would have told him about the visit.[^39] The domestic helper further conceded under cross-examination that the Wife had taken B to see the doctor on 26 July 2018 because B had been sick for a few days[^40]. The Husband argued that even if the Wife was nursing B, it did not mean that the alleged incident could not have happened later on at night after B had slept. However, the domestic helper conceded that the Wife had nursed B for the rest of the night because he was unwell[^41]. The domestic helper also accepted that the Wife was looking forward to leave for the UK the next day[^42], because the Wife’s sister was also in the UK and she was looking forward to seeing her[^43], and the Children are also close to her sister’s son in the UK and A was excited to see him.[^44] It was illogical that the Wife, who had just returned from Pakistan, nursing B who was sick, and looking forward to the trip to the UK, would suddenly request to go back to Pakistan alone without the Children and try to kill herself on the day before departure to the UK. The Wife testified that she did not know why the Husband had bought her a ticket to Pakistan. Whilst the Husband had asked the Wife whether she was going to the UK on 27 July 2018 or whether she had any other ideas back in August 2018, she explained he could be thinking that she had wanted to stay on longer for her trip to Pakistan when she accompnied her mother home. In any event, she returned to Singapore on 24 July 2018 in time before the trip on 27 July 2018. On 27 July 2018, even after the Wife’s alleged suicide attempt, the Husband continued to let the Wife send A to school and pick A up after school with the driver.

35     As such, given the totality of evidence, I was unable to find that the Husband has discharged his burden of proof on a balance of probabilities to show that the Wife had tried to kill herself on 26 July 2018.

### 16 September 2018 incident

36     In my judgment, due to the illogical and incongruous evidence, the Husband has also failed to prove that the Wife had threatened to kill herself and the Children on 16 September 2018.

37      _First_, the Husband testified that on that day, he had returned from a trip and had choked on food. He went to the guest room to smoke. The Wife went to the guest room saw him smoking, threw herself on the floor and threatened to kill the Children. These descriptions were however not set out in affidavit[^45]. The Husband said the smoking was a trigger that caused the Wife to react adversely, but it was illogical that the Wife would react in such a drastic and adverse manner simply because the Husband was smoking.

38      _Second_, the domestic helper’s evidence on the alleged incident was riddled with multiple inconsistencies. For instance:

> (a)     she gave evidence that the Wife had pulled the Children up the stairs whilst shouting that she was going to kill the Children, and that whilst there was a protective gate at the base of the steps leading to the second storey[^46], it was open and could have been opened by A. It however did not make sense that there would be a protective gate that could be opened by the Children thereby endangering their safety ordinarily;

> (b)     in her affidavit, she gave evidence that the Wife had repeatedly told the Husband that she was going to jump down with the Children. She however testified at the trial that she did not in fact understand what the Wife was saying in her own Punjabi language, and it was the Husband who had told her that the Wife was going to kill the Children;

> (c)     she stated in her affidavit that she had brought the Children to the Children’s room after the Husband managed to take the Children away from the Wife, but testified at the trial she brought the Children to her room and did not go to the Children’s room at all[^47];

> (d)     the domestic helper in fact conceded that, consistent with the Wife’s evidence, the Wife had come out of the bathroom 15 minutes after entering, and the Husband was in the guest room at the time, and both Children could have slept with the Wife the entire night :

**_Maybe.”_** (emphasis added).

39      _Third_, the Husband testified that after the alleged incident, he slept with the Wife the whole of that night[^48]. However, the Wife messaged an extract from a romantic Urdu poem to the Husband on 17 September 2018 at 1.51AM. The Husband then replied at 1.53AM “_Let’s go for dinner tomorrow or just movie_”. The Wife must have messaged the Husband because he was sleeping in another room, otherwise it would be rather strange for them to be awake in the same room and communicating through messages instead of verbally face-to face. Further, the Husband’s response of going for dinner or a movie the next day appeared to be a rather muted and underwhelming response to the Wife’s alleged attempts at killing herself and the Children that night. Instead, the message illustrated that the Husband had done something wrong and wanted to make it up by going on a date of dinner and movie. He testified that it was a moment of self-reflection for him, which is consistent with his conduct being as what the Wife described, coming home intoxicated, vomitting on his food and smoking in the apartment, rather than the Wife’s alleged conduct in trying to kill the Children.

40      _Fourth_, the Husband accepted that notwithstanding the Wife had allegedly tried to kill A and B on 16 September 2018, the Husband had allowed the Wife to send A to school and pick him back after school between 17 to 20 September 2019, as if nothing had happened[^49]. This was so even though the Wife had to bring A down the apartment building alone by herself, walk A to the cab waiting downstairs, accompany A in the cab towards the school, and carry A (who weighed around 25 kg) up the staircase leading to the school to drop him off[^50]. The Husband testified that he was comfortable with the Wife sending A to school because he trusted the driver of the cab who was his domestic helper’s uncle. However, it was illogical that he would allow someone who had just tried to kill A the night before to be alone with A, and to only entrust a driver to ensure his child’s safety the entire time. He said he tried to work from home as much as possible after 16 September 2018, yet if so, he did not offer to accompany A to school even though he was purportedly concerned for A’s safety. His evidence was that there were times when the domestic helper sends A to school, yet neither did he ask the domestic helper to do so to ensure A’s safety.

41      _Fifth_, the Husband also accepted that between 17 and 20 September 2018, he had spent many hours away from the Matrimonial Home at his lawyer’s office. On 17 September 2018, he only reached home around 6.30PM to 6.45PM[^51]. On 18 September 2018, he only got home between 10.30PM and 11PM at night[^52]. On 18 September 2018, the domestic helper also left the house to do her affidavit at the lawyer’s office, leaving the Children with the Wife (although the Husband claimed another helper went over). On 19 September 2018, the Husband was out of the Matrimonial Home by latest 11.00AM and only returned home after 7.00PM[^53]. It is again incredible that the Husband would allow someone who had just tried to kill the Children to be with the Children at home, and to entrust only helpers to ensure their safety. The Husband argued that he did not want to immediately remove the Children from the Matrimonial Home as he was unfamiliar with the laws in Singapore and did not want to be perceived as abducting the children. Even if that were the case, it did not appear that he took sufficient or reasonable steps to ensure the Children’s safety by leaving them with someone who had allegedly just tried to kill them, accompanied by only a driver or a domestic helper.

42      _Sixth_, the Husband accepted that between 17 and 19 September 2018, he had exchanged routine and ordinary messages with the Wife as if nothing had happened on 16 September 2018. On 17 September 2018, the Husband messaged the Wife at 5.06PM “_What are you guys doing?”_ and _“In meeting. Give me an hour, leaving in 5 minutes_”. On 18 September 2019, the Husband messaged at 10.09PM “_Just finished_”, the Wife replied “_Love you_” and he replied “_Love you too_”. On 19 September 2018, the Wife sent a message at 11:30am asking “_Busy_?” and he replied “_Yes, very_”. At 6:38pm, he sent her a message “_What are you up to_?”, “_Just finishing up_”, and even “_Who’s at home_”. The Husband accepted that on 20 September 2018, the Wife could have also messaged him that she needed money to bring the Children to the doctor for their regular check-up, and further asked if he would be eating at home, as part of normal conversations they would regularly have.[^54] Strikingly, no reference were made in all these messages to the Wife’s alleged violence on 16 September 2018. The Husband said he was trying to maintain things as normal as possible to keep things calm, but the absence of any reference to any tension or conflict between parties even by the Wife is at odds with what had allegedly happened on 16 September 2018.

43      _Seventh_, the Husband testified that the Wife had banged her head on the wall on the evening of 19 September 2018. This is however absent from his affidavit. Indeed, it is illogical that the Wife would have left B in their room, went to the Husband’s room, banged her head on the wall for 20 seconds, and then went back to the other room to sleep with B. The Husband did not even ask her why she was banging her head on the wall. If this alleged incident happened on 19 September 2018 evening, the Wife would not have simply and readily obeyed the Husband when he asked her to go buy B12 tablets from a shop[^55] for him to use that opportunity to take the Children away with him.

44     Given the above reasons, I was similarly unable to find that the Husband has discharged his burden of proof on a balance of probabilities to show that the Wife had tried to kill herself and the Children on 16 September 2018.

45     It is noteworthy that the Wife has also subjected herself to psychological examination by a psychiatrist and gone through a personality profile test by a psychologist, Dr XXX, in September 2018, and it was confirmed that she did not have any psychiatric signs or symptoms that indicate she is incapable of taking care of the Children. I would however place little weight on this evidence as these psychological examinations were done much later after the alleged events of 26 July and 16 September 2018.

### No necessity for the PPO

46     In any event, I did not consider that there was any necessity for the PPO for the Children.

47     The Wife currently only has supervised access to the Children and there has been no violence in these visits since September 2018 (save for one incident where the Wife allegedly did not want to let the Children leave). The Wife produced video recordings evidencing A running to her excitedly and joyously for one of these visits, and both Children being very attached and comfortable with the Wife at another visit[^56]. The Husband testified that the Children looked forward to seeing the Wife and are excited to see her[^57]. The Wife also produced a video recording evidencing that in December 2018, the Husband left the Children alone with the Wife on the second storey of the Matrimonial Home where she had allegedly tried to jump off on 26 July 2018 and where she was going to jump off with the Children on 16 September 2018.[^58] He remained on the first storey of the Matrimonial Home. The Husband also did not produce any evidence of any emotional injury or specialist treatment required for the Children following 16 September 2018, even though his evidence is that the Children were frightened and would not stop crying.

48     The Wife is also a full time homemaker who has relocated from Pakistan to Singapore, and took care of the Children on her own with only part time help until a full time maid was engaged in November 2017. The domestic helper accepted that the Wife was the main caregiver of the Children[^59], a good mother[^60] who looked after the Children well, she took them for different classes, swimming, to the park, for birthday parties, she sat with them and spent the day with them throughout the day-- she did everything which a good mother would do. The domestic helper testified that the Wife cooked regularly at home, did errands for the family, even when the Wife was in hospital with her sick mother in May and June 2018, the domestic helper had to call the Wife regularly at the hospital as she could not adequately care for the Children and the Children missed their mother immensely. Parties have also engaged experienced lawyers, are embroiled in multiple and acrimonious litigation proceedings in the Family Court and the Syariah Court. In my view, it serves no ends of justice for a PPO to be issued against the Wife, who is undisputedly a good mother and whom the Children are so overwhelmingly attached to, to be potentially used against her in deciding the award of custody of the Children. Any outstanding issues parties may still have in relation to the Wife’s time with the Children could still be redressed through the necessary custody orders.

### The Husband’s true agenda

49     It is noteworthy that the Husband accepted under cross-examination that parties and their family members had in fact attended a series of meetings about parties’ marital issues (including the Husband’s conduct in the marriage) in the UK when they travelled there in July/August 2018. This series of meetings was glaringly absent from the Husband’s affidavit. What the Husband testified had happened was that the Wife and her family wanted her to remain in the UK with the Children, as she had family in the UK and they would assist in providing her with a home there. When the Wife’s family said they would support her in the UK, the Husband’s father even pulled the Husband out of the room to tell him he had better do something about that quickly. The Husband also hovered about divorce. Parties stayed separately for a few days and the Husband later met the Wife at a Starbucks to persuade the Wife to give their relationship one more try for the sake of the Children. After the return to Singapore on 1 September 2018, these allegations herein conveniently arose.

50     The Wife’s position is that the Husband went into a state of panic when he heard that the Wife would leave him and stay in the UK with the Children. Hence, he deliberately engineered her return to Singapore to prevent any possibility of the Wife obtaining a divorce in the UK where divorce laws would be more favourable to her in getting half of his assets, wife maintenance and custody of the Children. This was the Husband’s belief about the state of law in the UK[^61]. Hence, the Husband brought the Wife back to Singapore, schemingly fabricated stories to deprive the Wife of the Children, surreptiously spirited the Children away to an unknown location, orchestrated a divorce in the Syariah Court in Singapore which Syariah laws would be more favourable to him, and cancelled her dependant’s pass knowing the Wife would be without family support in Singapore. Interestingly, and fortunately for the Wife, the Husband’s maternal uncle (i.e., his mother’s brother), who is also the Wife’s sister’s husband, has come to the Wife’s support in Singapore.

51     I however do not have to make any findings on the Husband’s underlying motivations in his actions. It suffices for me in order to dispose of this application to hold that the Husband has failed to discharge his burden of proof on a balance of probabilities that the Wife has threatened and tried to kill herself and the Children, and/or that a PPO is necessary for the Children’s protection.

## D.    Conclusion

52     In these circumstances, I dismissed the Husband’s application for a PPO for the Children accordingly. I however ordered that each party bear their own costs given the considerations set out in \[15\] herein.
