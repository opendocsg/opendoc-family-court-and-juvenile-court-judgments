Variation of Ancillary Matters Orders - Custody Care Control and Access - Child Maintenance - Division of Matrimonial Property

3 March 2021

### District Judge Goh Zhuo Neng:

## A.   INTRODUCTION

1       This was an application (“**Application**”) by the Defendant father (“**Father**”) on 3 June 2020 to vary a consent order that he had entered into with the Plaintiff mother (“**Mother**”) on 6 March 2020 (“**Order**”). The full terms of the Order and the Application are set out at **Annex A and B** respectively.

2       The Father was essentially asking for a variation of practically every aspect of the Order, including the maintenance for the child of the marriage (the “**Child**”), the custody care control and access of the Child, as well as the division of assets.

3       On 25 November 2020, I heard the Application. The Mother was represented and the Father was in person. I made the following orders to vary the Order :

> a)     New Paragraph 6A - The Plaintiff and Defendant will notify each other of all the Child’s medical appointments and share the medical reports of the Child. The Plaintiff will also indicate to all medical institutions attended by the Child that the Defendant is the alternative contact of the Child.

> b)     New Paragraph 2A - Both the Plaintiff and the Defendant shall give the other party at least 1 month’s written notice in advance if either party were to travel out of Singapore with the Child. The notice must indicate the country the Child is travelling to, the dates and duration of travel, the travel itinerary, the location of the Child’s accommodation in that country, and a phone number by which the Child can be contacted. The Child’s passport will remain in the custody of the Mother, and be handed over with the Child when the Father takes access for the period when overseas travel takes place. The passport will be returned to the Mother with the Child when that period of access ends.

> c)     Variation of Paragraph 4 – To provide that the transfer of the Mother’s share of the matrimonial flat is to be completed within 3 months from the date of my order.

4       All of the other prayers in the Application were dismissed. I also ordered the Father to pay costs of $2,000.00 to the Mother.

5       On 3 December 2020, the Father filed a Notice of Appeal against my decision. I set out below the full grounds of my decision. As I had effectively granted the Father’s prayers in 2(b) and (c) of the Application by making the orders to insert new paragraphs 2A and 6A of the Order, I will not address my reasons for making these orders here.

## B.   VARIATION OF CUSTODY CARE AND CONTROL AND ACCESS

### I.   Background

6       The Child was born on XXX 2018. It was not disputed that the Child had been solely under the Mother’s care since March 2019.

7       The Father was relying on a multitude of factors to vary the existing orders on care and control and access of the Child. Essentially, he wanted to:

> a)     Increase his Access by a Day - Have shared care and control of the children, which would start one day earlier on a Thursday, instead of a Friday. His access would continue to end on a Sunday.

> b)     Choice of Playschool - For the Child’s choice of school to be agreed mutually by both parties in writing. This would remove the current exception which allowed the Mother to decide the Child’s play school until the Child was 3 years of age.

8       The bulk of these facts existed prior to the making of the Order. Therefore I could not give them much weight in determining this application.

> a)     The Mother’s criminal convictions in 2010 for shoplifting and an offence under the Poisons’ Act.

> b)     The Mother’s treatment at the Institute of Mental Health in 2010 and 2011.

> c)     The Mother’s involvement of Child Protection Services in 2019.

> d)     The Mother’s conduct in the course of Applications filed by the Mother for a Personal Protection Order in 2019 (“**PPO Application**”). The applications were heard and dismissed on 29 August 2019.

9       During the hearing, the Father claimed that he had only become aware of the Mother’s criminal convictions as well as her treatment at the Institute of Mental Health during the course of preparing for the hearing of the PPO Application in 2019. I also found that these factors on their own would not justify a variation of the order to increase the Father’s access. They had occurred before the Order was made and the Mother had been punished for them under the law. What was more crucial to examine was the present and how the Child was fairing under the Mother’s care, rather than to dig up the Mother’s past.

10     I will address both prayers referred to in paragraphs 7(a) and (b) separately.

### II.   Should the Father’s Access be Increased?

11     The Father was seeking shared care and control and to effectively increase his access. The main issue of concern raised by him was that the Child was drastically losing weight under the Mother’s care.

12     On 25 June 2019, the Child was seen for development assessment. It was noted that from the Child’s health booklets and medical information, there was a decrease in growth centiles for his weight:

> a)     75th centile (at birth),

> b)     97th centile (6 weeks old),

> c)     > 75th centile (3 months old),

> d)     > 25th centile (4 months old),

> e)     25th centile (25 June 2019)

13     Consequently, the Child was referred for further review. Medical reports were provided, which confirmed the following:

> a)     The Child was seen on 25 June 2019 at Ang Mo Kio Polyclinic. The above decrease in weight centile at paragraph 11 was observed. His physical examination was normal and he was referred to a paediatric specialist at KK Hospital for further assessment. (Report of Dr CF dated 7 August 2020)

> b)     The Child was seen on 18 July 2019 at KK Hospital. The Child examined well and was found to be developmentally normal. It was suspected that the Child was possibly experiencing catch down growth, which is a period of slow growth that follows a period of fast growth above the normal range. (Report of Dr CS dated 6 July 2020, Report of Dr NN dated 3 August 2020)

> c)     The Child was fixed for a further appointment on 17 October 2019, but the Child did not show up for that appointment (Report of Dr CS dated 6 July 2020, Report of Dr NN dated 3 August 2020). The Mother confirmed that she did not bring the Child to this appointment as his weight was normal.

> d)     The Child was seen on 26 June 2020 at KK Hospital. The appointment was scheduled at the Father’s request. His growth was noted as 10.1kg which was between the 25th – 50th centile. The conclusion was that the initial concern of faltering weight was consistent with catch down growth and the Child was now growing along age appropriate centiles within his genetic potential. (Report of Dr CS dated 6 July 2020, Report of Dr NN dated 3 August 2020)

> e)     The Child was given a follow up appointment in 4 months’ time to continue tracking his growth, however it is not clear if the Child had attended the appointment. (Report of Dr CS dated 6 July 2020, Report of Dr NN dated 3 August 2020)

14     The Father explained that based on a Dietician’s Report dated 20 July 2020, the Child’s ideal weight was 10.75kg. However, his weight constantly remained at the lower end of 10kg and sometimes fell below 10kg prior to being handed over to the Father for access. A list of weight measurements taken by the Father is set out below.

> a)     Start of Access – 21 August 2020 – 9.7 kg

> b)     End of Access – 23 August 2020 – 10.6 kg

> c)     Start of Access – 28 August 2020 – 10.2 kg

> d)     End of Access – 30 August 2020 – 10.4 kg

> e)     Start of Access – 3 September 2020 – 10.0 kg

> f)     End of Access – 6 September 2020 – 10.2 kg

> g)     Start of Access – 10 September 2020 – 10.2 kg

> h)     End of Access – 13 September 2020 – 10.4 kg

> i)     Start of Access – 18 September 2020 – 10.4 kg

> j)     End of Access – 20 September 2020 – 10.3 kg

> k)     Start of Access – 26 September 2020 – 9.6 kg

> l)     End of Access – 27 September 2020 – 10.3 kg

> m)     Start of Access – 1 October 2020 – 10.0 kg

15     The Father claimed that the only reason why the Child was able to maintain his weight and increase it by the end of access with him, was because he was feeding the Child properly and the Child was not properly nourished by the Mother. Hence it would be appropriate for his access to increase so that the Child could receive nutrition more consistently under the Father’s care.

16     I did not find this argument persuasive. The medical reports indicated that the Child’s faltering weight in June 2020 had already been identified as an issue of catch down growth. At no time had any of the reports noted that there were deficiencies in his physical development. Even at a weight of 10.1kg, the Child’s growth was in line with his genetic potential. It was not helpful to imagine that the Child was suffering from neglect simply because he was under his ideal weight at 10.75kg.

17     When I explained this to the Father during the hearing, he pointed out that the opinion of the doctors should not be relied on as they were not measuring the weight of the Child on a weekly basis, as he did.

18     This comment reflected the Father’s unfortunate fixation with the Child’s high growth centile at birth and at 6 weeks. In my view, this had caused him to have unrealistic expectations of the Child’s growth trajectory, and when the Child experienced catch down growth, he perceived it as the result of neglect by the Mother. I would point out that the Child is still very young and it would be best for the Father to rely on the advice of medical professionals.

19     I should also point out that the health booklets relied on by the Father to indicate the Child’s faltering growth up till 4 months old were provided to him on 28 February 2020 – the week before he entered into the consent order on 3 March 2020. They were facts he was well aware of prior to entering into the Order, and he should not be allowed to rely on them now to vary it.

20     In the circumstances, I saw no good reason to increase the Father’s access.

### III.   Should the Parties’ Agreement be Required for the Child’s Choice of School?

21     In his supporting affidavit, the Father did not provide any explanation as to why the Parties’ agreement should be required for the Child’s choice of school (including play school).

22     When asked about this during the hearing, he claimed that he had forgotten to do so. The Father then pointed out that in August 2020 (after the Application had been filed), there was an incident where the Child had verbalised a name for the Child’s genitals. The Child had then brushed his feet against the groin area of the Father’s pants. The Father was concerned that the Mother had laughed this off when it was raised, and felt that the Child was not being brought up properly. He was also concerned that the Child would proceed to inappropriately touch other children at playschool.

23     I would point out that the Child was only enrolled in playschool on 1 September 2020, after this incident had allegedly taken place. While the Child may have made an imprudent remark, these are learning points for all parents. I did not think in all seriousness that the Mother would condone such behaviour if it involved another child in the playschool. Therefore I took the view that it had no bearing on the Mother’s right to select the Child’s school.

24     The Father also raised other concerns about the Child’s playschool, which I address below:

> a)     That the Child was being sent to playschool to deprive the Father of access on Thursday. This was a strange allegation to make, considering the Father’s access under the Order begin on Friday.

> b)     Whether the playschool selected by the Mother could provide adequate nutrition for the Child. The issue of the Child’s nutrition has already been addressed above and as explained, I am satisfied that it is not an area of concern.

> c)     The Mother should not have enrolled the Child in playschool during the COVID-19 pandemic. He had several criticisms about the qualifications of the teachers in the school, and how a former principal of the school had been convicted of a criminal breach of trust. He proposed that it was better for the Child to be schooled at home, and criticised the commercial nature of playschool education in Singapore as well as how children in his extended family had benefited from not attending playschool. These arguments were an unconvincing attempt to revise the order to which he had agreed to. The Child had only been placed in playschool in September 2020, and it was in my view premature to make an assessment on the Child’s development under the playschool.

25     For the reasons above, I did not vary the orders prayed for by the Father.

## C.   CHILD MAINTENANCE

26     The Father’s prayers for variation of Child maintenance were inserted to limit the Child’s expenses to $100.00 a month plus 50% of school education expenses to be mutually agreed to by the parties. This was a significant departure from the existing order that the Father pay 65% of the Child’s expenses.

27     In support of his application, the Father explained that he had lost his job on 18 March 2020, just a week after the Order had been made. No proof was provided to the Court on his loss of job, save for what he claimed was his final paycheck, or his bank account balances. I should add that there was a pending application in MSS XX of 2020 by the Mother for enforcement of the Father’s outstanding maintenance (“**MSS**”). The MSS had been heard and was fixed for decision on 8 December 2020.

28     The Father had submitted some of the documents tendered in the MSS the evidence in the Application. However, he had omitted proof of his CPF Statements which would have shown whether he was still receiving CPF contributions from his employer. He also omitted his bank accounts and proof of debts he allegedly owed to financial institutions.

29     The Father also argued that the Mother was spending unnecessarily on the Child’s expenses. He produced examples of how he was able to purchase certain items more cheaply. The expenses that the Mother was seeking the Father’s contribution for from March to August 2020 are set out below.

30     I note that the Father had received a net monthly pay of **$4,249.15** in March 2020. This was a sum far in excess of the expenses claimed from March to August 2020. As I did not have the Father’s bank statements or proof of his unemployment, it was not possible to assess whether the Father was unemployed. Even if he had lost his job, without his bank statements it was not possible to assess whether he lacked the means or savings to pay for maintenance. For instance, he could have received a severance payment, or the remaining balance in his bank account could have been sufficient for him to pay the maintenance. Therefore I dismissed the application to vary the Child’s maintenance.

## D.   DIVISION OF ASSETS

### I.   The Father’s Arguments

31     The Father was seeking a recalculation of the amounts he should pay the Mother for her share of the matrimonial home, and for an extension of time to complete the transaction. Emphasis in bold and underline is added.

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="49.78%"> <col width="50.22%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Order</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Variation Prayed For</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">The matrimonial flat shall be transferred to the Defendant (other than by way of sale) upon the Defendant paying the Plaintiff a <b><u>sum of $20,000 and refunding in full the Plaintiff’s CPF account with the sum used by her for the purchase of the said flat and the accrued interest.</u></b> The Defendant shall bear all the transfer cost and expenses. The transfer shall be completed <b><u>within 6 months of Final Judgment.</u></b></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">The matrimonial flat shall be transferred to the Defendant (other than by way of sale) upon the Defendant <b><u>refunding the Plaintiff a total CPF sum equivalent to 50% of the net value of the matrimonial flat (i.e. the purchase price, less outstanding loan). The Plaintiff shall refund her CPF account(s) of the monies withdrawn for the acquisition of the matrimonial flat from the monies she receives.</u></b> The transfer shall be completed <b><u>within 1 year (i.e. 12 months) of Final Judgment.</u></b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

32     As the certificate of final judgement was issued on 4 June 2020, the Father was effectively seeking for the deadline of the transfer to be extended from 4 December 2020 to 4 June 2021.

33     In his supporting affidavit, the Father submitted that it was no longer fair for him to pay the Mother the sum under the Order as the Mother had removed all the furniture and electrical appliances from the matrimonial home before leaving it. He had been handed an apartment that was almost fully emptied. The value of the flat had effectively been devalued by the costs incurred by the Father to replace these items.

### II.   The Law

34     The law imposes a very high threshold on the variation of order for the division of matrimonial assets under Section 112(4) of the Women’s Charter which provides that:

>      _“The Court may at any time it thinks fit, extend, vary, revoke or discharge any order under this section, and may vary any term or condition upon or subject to which any such order has been made”._

35     In the case of _TYA v TYB_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1170</span>, the Court made the following findings:

> a)     If the order to be varied has been fully implemented, the Court does not have the power to vary, set aside or otherwise reopen the issues in that order, save in a case of fraud.

> b)     If the order has not been fully implemented, the Court will only vary the order where it is unworkable due to a lack of functionality of the order, or due to a fundamental misunderstanding at the time the order was made, or the order has become unworkable as a result of new circumstances that had changed the situation that to implement the order would be to implement something radically different from what was originally intended.

### III.   Application to the Facts

36     I found that the Father should not be entitled to a variation of the Order based on the facts stated above. The terms of the transfer were clear. They were for a transfer of the Mother’s interest in the matrimonial home. Not for the items in the matrimonial home, which were addressed by the order that parties retain all assets in their own name.

37     In his subsequent affidavits filed in the Application, the Father made further submissions on the direct and indirect contributions of the parties, and how a more equitable division could be made. A reference was also made to a sum of $14,000.00 that the Mother had received from the Paternal Grandfather in 6 February 2012 for the deposit of the matrimonial property. The Father was effectively asking the Court to recalculate the division of matrimonial property based on facts that had existed prior to the making of the Order. He also admitted during the hearing that these facts were also known to him at the time the Order had been made.

38     In the circumstances, I dismissed the Father’s application to vary the division of assets under the Order, save that I granted an extension of time for the transfer of the Mother’s share to be effected within 3 months from the date of my order (25 February 2021 – a 2 month 3 week extension from the original deadline of 4 December 2020). The Father claimed that he needed more time to effect the transfer as he was currently unemployed. As explained above, there was insufficient proof that he was currently unemployed, and even if he had been, a considerable period of time had passed which would have allowed him to obtain a job.

## E.   OTHER PRAYERS MADE IN THE APPLICATION

39     I will deal with the other prayers made under the Application.

### I.   Town Council Conservancy Payments

40     The Father had asked the town council conservancy fees be shared equally by both parties until the transfer of the Mother’s share in the matrimonial home. Under _TIC v TID_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGCA 75</span> \[21,23\], the prima facie position was that the Father as the only person benefitting from the transfer should continue bearing the expenses pending the transfer of the matrimonial home to him. This would include conservancy fees.

41     I was not aware of any injustice that would displace this prima facie position. The Father by his own admission had moved into the matrimonial flat since May 2020 and would continue to live there. The Mother had moved out since March 2019.

### II.   Return of the Jewellery Bought by the Paternal Grandmother

42     The Father was seeking the return of jewellery that the Paternal Grandmother had melted down into gifts of jewellery for the Child and the Mother.

43     As they were gifts, and the Order specifies that parties are to retain all assets in their own names, there is no basis for me to order the return of items that were given to the Mother.

44     As for the jewellery given to the Child, such items were not sufficiently particularised in the application or supporting affidavits. There is insufficient evidence for me to determine whether these items even existed. Therefore I made no orders on them.

## F.   CONCLUSION AND COSTS

45     For the reasons set out above, I made the above orders. The Mother’s counsel submitted that the Father should bear legal costs of $2,500.00. The Father asked that no costs be ordered against him as two of his prayers had been granted. However, the bulk of the Father’s prayers had been dismissed, and the bulk of evidence and arguments brought forward in these proceedings were related to matters that were already known to the Father prior to entering into the Order. It was only appropriate that the Father pay the costs of unsuccessfully litigating these prayers and I ordered that the Father should pay costs of $2,000.00 to the Mother.
