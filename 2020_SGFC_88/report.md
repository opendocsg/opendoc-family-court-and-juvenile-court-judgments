Family Law – Consent Order – Setting Aside

Family Law – Dissipation of Assets; Adverse Inference

23 October 2020

### District Judge Christine Lee:

## INTRODUCTION

1       This case involved the Wife’s application in Summons 2543/2019 to set aside the Ancillary Matters Consent Order dated 22 April 2019 and the Husband’s cross application in Summons 2437/2019 for enforcement of the same Consent Order.

2       The case was heard over five days and Parties agreed for my decision to be rendered in writing and sent to them by way of Registrar’s Notice (“RN”) which was delivered on 18 August 2020.

3       Having heard the submissions and after considering the evidence, I dismissed the Wife’s application and granted the Husband’s application for the reasons set out below.

## BRIEF FACTS

4       The Plaintiff Wife (“the Wife”) and Defendant Husband (“the Husband”) were married on 19 November 1991 in Singapore. There are three children from the marriage who are now all aged above 21 years (“the 3 children”). The marriage lasted about 27 years before the Wife filed Writ of Divorce on 17 October 2018.

5       Interim Judgement was granted on an uncontested basis on 11 January 2019 with the Ancillary Matters (“AMs”) adjourned to be heard in Chambers. However, there was a preliminary agreement between the Parties and a “By Consent Order” was issued on 26 February 2019 purely with regard to the youngest child and the Liberty to Apply clause.

6       All the remaining AMs were subsequently dealt with in a second By Consent Order” dated 22 April 2019 (“22 April 2019 AM Consent Order”)[^1]. This Consent Order was based on a Settlement Agreement that had been signed after a full day mediation session held on 12 April 2019, which started at 9.30am and ended at 9.00pm. As such, Certificate of Final Judgement (“FJ”) was issued on 8 May 2019.

7       Prior to the mediation session on 12 April 2019, the Wife and Husband signed an ‘Agreement to Mediate’ dated 27 March 2019[^2]. The mediation was conducted at the Singapore Mediation Centre (SMC) by two lawyers who were the mediators appointed by the SMC. The Settlement Agreement was signed by the Parties’ lawyers and initialled at the bottom of each page by the Wife and Husband[^3].

8       Following the signing of the Settlement Agreement, a Draft Consent Order (“DCO”) was filed on 16 April 2019. The DCO was approved which resulted in the 22 April 2019 AM Consent Order. This provided that the Husband was to pay the Wife the sum of $2.55 million comprising cash in three tranches, the first two in the sum of $500,000 each and the balance in the sum of $342,000 together with the \[_address redacted_\] property, which was valued at $1.208 million, if the Wife elected to keep this property.

9       Should the Wife decide not to take the \[_address redacted_\] property, then the Husband was to pay her the value of $1.208 million within 12 months of the Wife’s decision not to accept or within 2 weeks of the sale of the \[_address redacted_\] property. The Wife waived her rights to maintenance, but the Husband was to pay monthly maintenance to the Wife until 29 February 2020, which is the date that the Wife was to move out of the matrimonial home.

10     On 22 April 2019, ten days after the Settlement Agreement was signed, the Wife’s Counsel informed the Husband’s Counsel that the Wife had elected to keep the \[_address redacted_\] property. On 15 May 2019, the Husband proceeded to pay the Wife the first tranche of $500,000. The Husband also proceeded to pay the monthly maintenance of up to $2,950 to the Wife.

11     Until the issuance of the FJ on 8 May 2019, the Wife (a housewife) was represented by B LLC (“the Wife’s Former Counsel”) and the Husband (who is also a lawyer) was and continues to be represented by Ann Tan & Associates (“the Husband’s Counsel”).

12     The Wife discharged her Former Counsel and appointed Dodwell & Co LLC (“the Wife’s Counsel”) who represented her for the hearing of this case (reference to Notice of Change of Solicitors filed on 30 May 2019).

## ISSUES AT THE HEARING

13     This case originally involved three Summons applications (one by the Wife and two by the Husband) in D4792/2018. All three Summons applications related to the AMs under the 22 April 2019 AM Consent Order.

14     At the hearing on 6 February 2020, I granted Leave to the Husband’s Counsel to withdraw **SUM 2734/2019.** However, on 4 June 2020, the Wife’s Counsel filed a fresh application in **SUM 1332/2020**, which I dealt with as a preliminary issue at the hearing on 26 June 2020, thereby disposing of it. The crux of this decision is therefore regarding the two remaining Summons applications in **SUM 2437/2019 and SUM 2543/2019.**

15     In the course of hearing this case, no less than seven Affidavits were filed by both Parties as follows:

**_preliminary issues_**

16     I dealt with two preliminary issues, both of which related to the striking out of portions of both Parties’ Affidavits.

17     Firstly, the Husband’s Counsel submitted that the Wife was in violation of section 10 of the Mediation Act regarding the photos and discussions during the mediation session on 12 April 2019, which were put into various paragraphs in three of the Wife’s Affidavits. It was submitted that these paragraphs fell within the definition of “mediation communication” and should be struck out.

18     I agreed with the Husband’s Counsel that the photographs taken by the Wife at the mediation session should immediately be struck out. However, I disagreed with the Husband’s Counsel that the objected paragraphs in the Wife’s Affidavits namely, in P1, P2 and P4, should also be struck out.

19     In this regard, I agreed with the Wife’s Counsel that as these portions of the Wife’s Affidavits set out the Wife’s version of the circumstances of the mediation session in support of her claim that she was not able to make decisions and give informed consent when the Settlement Agreement was signed, these portions were directly relevant and necessary to the Wife’s application in SUM 2543/2019 for setting aside the 22 April 2019 AM Consent Order.

20     The Husband’s Counsel then sought leave to obtain the mediation records leading to the Settlement Agreement. However, I ruled that this was not allowed because of section 6(2)(b) of the Mediation Act.

21     The Husband’s Counsel also sought leave for the two mediators to provide a Statement on (i) whether or not the Wife had actively participated at the mediation session in the resolution of the Settlement Agreement; (ii) whether the Wife had made a concluding statement at the end of the mediation session and (iii) what steps were taken to ensure that the Wife understood the terms of the Settlement Agreement before it was signed.

22     I adjourned the hearing to consider the implications of this request. However, I decided against making an order for the two mediators to be asked to file a Mediators Statement on what had transpired during the mediation session. Instead, I directed that the Husband file an Affidavit giving his own version of what had transpired. This was done in the Husband’s Affidavit dated 3 April 2020 (D7).

23     However, this led to the second preliminary issue whereby the Wife filed **SUM 1332/2020** to object to certain portions of the Husband’s Affidavit in D7 on the ground that there were additional portions that went beyond my directions. I agreed with the Wife’s Counsel and these portions were therefore struck out.

24     Following which, the hearing continued to complete the submissions on the remaining two Summons applications in SUM 2437/2019 and 2543/2019. After which, I adjourned the matter to make my decision, which Counsel agreed could be sent to them by RN.

## HEARING ON SUM 2437/2019 AND 2543/2019

25     The above two Summonses involved hearings on 14 January 2020, 6 February 2020, 17 March 2020 and 26 June 2020. I decided to proceed with the Wife’s application in **SUM 2543/2019** first, as the outcome of this Summons application would directly affect the Husband’s application in **SUM 2437/2019** although the Husband’s application had been filed first in time.

26     For the Wife’s application in **SUM 2543/2019** which was filed on 25 July 2019, the Wife applied for:

> Prayer 1: Stay of execution of the 22 April 2019 AM Consent Order;

> Prayer 2: That the said Order of Court be set aside;

> Prayer 3: Consequentially, directions for the ancillary matters between the Wife and the Husband pursuant to their divorce in this action to be determined pursuant to section 112 of the Women's Charter (Cap. 353);

> Prayer 4: The Husband bears the costs of and incidental to this application; and

> Prayer 5: Such further or other relief or directions as the Court deems fit.

27     At the hearing on 6 February 2020, in response to my query, the Wife’s Counsel confirmed that the Wife wanted the 22 April 2019 AM Consent Order to be set aside and that Prayer 1 was therefore redundant.

28     Regarding Prayer 2 of the Wife’s application for the 22 April 2019 AM Consent Order to be set aside, the Wife’s Counsel provided three main grounds in both the written and oral submissions as elaborated below. These were:

> (a)     the Wife’s inability to make decisions and give informed consent at the mediation session on 12 April 2019;

> (b)     the Husband had failed to make full and frank disclosure of his assets; and

> (c)     the Husband had dissipated assets that should have been included in the total pool of matrimonial assets.

**_wife’s inability to make decisions and give informed consent at the mediation session on 12 april 2019_**

29     It was submitted that the Wife was unable to make decisions at the time of the mediation session on 12 April 2019 when the Settlement Agreement (on which the 22 April 2019 AM Consent Order was based) was entered into for three reasons:

> (i)     Her mental condition of depression and alcohol abuse;

> (ii)     She was under the influence of alcohol during the mediation process; and

> (iii)     The Husband took advantage of her mental condition.

### Wife’s mental condition

30     The Wife’s Counsel relied on four medical reports in support of her mental condition. These were: (i) the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) report dated 10 July 2019 by Dr C that the Wife started at the IMH since February 2012 and remains a patient to-date[^4]. The Wife also submitted the dates of her medical visits for counselling and treatment for depression and alcohol use disorder[^5]. These pages showed the dates of the Wife’s visits to IMH from 14 February 2012 until 8 November 2018.

31     The Wife’s Counsel also relied on (ii) a medical report dated 30 June 2019 by Dr D of Raffles Hospital[^6]. The Wife had visited Dr D on 4 June 2019 and again on 24 June 2019 whereupon Dr D assessed that his observation of the Wife’s mental state as at 4 June 2019 and based on her narration of the events at the mediation session on 12 April 2019, was that the Wife suffered from concentration problems and could not find clarity of thought in making decisions. Dr D also stated that his assessment was that the Wife’s symptoms “at the mediation session would have an adverse effect on her judgement and decision-making”.

32     The Wife’s Counsel further relied on (iii) a medical report dated 6 September 2019 by Dr C of the IMH which stated that the Wife’s first visit to the Addiction Medicine Clinic was on 28 May 2013. The report also stated that the Wife was last seen on 7 August 2019 and that she suffers from Depression and Alcohol Use Disorder.

33     This report was forwarded to the Wife’s Counsel by Dr D in (iv) his report dated 24 September 2019[^7]. In this report, Dr D’s assessment, based on the Wife’s account of her vodka drinking at the mediation session on 12 April 2019, was that “Such state of mind would aggravate her capacity to make judgement and decision making”.

34     With regard to the Wife’s medical condition, the Husband’s Counsel referred to paragraphs 34 to 37 of their written submissions and submitted that this was a pre-condition since 2012 and that the Wife had been able to function on a day to day basis and take care of herself and the 3 children for the past 8 years in spite of her condition. It was also submitted that the medical reports submitted by the Wife, in particular, Dr D’s 30 June 2019 report, was based on 2 visits by the Wife in June 2019, at least 2 months after the mediation session and based solely on the Wife’s accounts. Dr D was also not the Wife’s attending doctor since 2012 and would have no knowledge of her progress up to the visit on 4 June 2019.

35     The Husband’s Counsel also submitted that the Wife’s Former Counsel “_would have known of the Wife’s medical condition and would also have done all things necessary to ensure that the Wife understood the terms of the Settlement Agreement and advised her on the same accordingly_” (see paragraph 26(h) of the written submissions). Hence the Wife’s mental condition was an afterthought and could not be used as a basis to set aside the 22 April 2019 AM Consent Order.

36     It was further submitted by the Husband’s Counsel that the Wife was given the opportunity to get a 2nd opinion during the mediation on 12 April 2019 – see paragraph 26(i) of the Husband’s Counsel’s written submissions. This referred to the Wife’s Third Affidavit dated 14 November 2019 (P3), whereby the Wife’s Former Counsel confirmed that the Wife had called and texted 3rd parties during the mediation[^8]. However, neither the Husband’s Counsel nor the Wife’s Counsel could provide any information as to who these 3rd parties were.

37     The Husband’s Counsel therefore submitted that the Wife was not in a disabled state at the mediation as she now claimed. The Husband’s Counsel also submitted that the Wife had negotiated the date of 29 February 2020 for her to move out of the matrimonial home herself. This was therefore put into the Settlement Agreement and the 22 April 2019 AM Consent Order.

38     In response, the Wife’s Counsel submitted that the Wife’s attempt to get a 2nd opinion from 3rd parties should be given little weight because the Wife’s Counsel was unable to verify who the Wife had called or texted. However, I noted that the Wife’s Counsel did not dispute the fact that the Wife did in fact call and text 3rd parties during the mediation when given the opportunity to do so.

### Under the influence of alcohol during the mediation

39     The Wife’s Counsel submitted that the Wife was under the influence of alcohol during the mediation process. The Wife had stated in paragraph 12 of the Wife’s Second Affidavit dated 25 September 2019 (P2), that she had sneaked vodka into her water because she was stressed out over the mediation process.

40     The Wife stated that she was drinking alcohol because it was a protracted mediation that had started at 9.30am and ended at 9.00pm. The Wife’s Counsel submitted that during this 12 hour mediation session, the Wife broke down many times (see paragraph 7 of P2). The Wife stated in P2 that she asked to be allowed to leave the room and be on her own which she was allowed to do. This was because she did not want to be in the same room as the Husband. Therefore, the mediators had to shuttle between the Husband’s room and her room so as to conduct the mediation.

41     In response to my query, the Wife’s Counsel confirmed that no one had forced the Wife to drink but submitted that it was her disorder acting up and the Wife had to consume the alcohol to calm her nerves at that point in time. In response to my further query, the Wife’s Counsel submitted that although the Wife had been drinking from the start of the mediation session, she was able to able to hide this from everyone because she had diluted the alcohol with water.

42     The Husband’s Counsel submitted that the Wife’s drinking of alcohol was self induced and there was no evidence that the Wife was under the influence of alcohol during the mediation. The Husband’s Counsel also submitted that there were 4 agreements signed and 6 lawyers involved so the Wife was ably and amply legally represented at all times.

43     The Husband’s Counsel also submitted that for the mediation, experienced mediators had been appointed and no issue had been raised against them. In addition, the SMC has strict rules regarding the conduct of mediation especially when a Settlement Agreement is to be signed. The Husband’s Counsel further submitted that there was participatory involvement of the Wife during the mediation and there was separate caucusing until the Parties agreed on the outcome.

44     The Husband’s Counsel further submitted that if the Wife was incapacitated at the time of the mediation, the mediators would have taken action. All the Wife had to do was to raise this with the mediators and the mediation would have been called off. Also, before the Settlement Agreement was finalised, the mediators themselves would check with the Parties that they understood and agreed with the terms before the Parties signed this agreement together with their Counsel.

45     The Wife’s Counsel responded that just because there were experienced mediators at the mediation, it does not rule out that there was no unfair advantage taken of the Wife. Otherwise this would mean that the unfair advantage principle cannot be invoked in all situations where there was a mediation leading to a settlement. However, I noted that the Wife’s Counsel did not submit that the two mediators appointed by the SMC had acted in any way that was detrimental to the Wife.

46     The Wife’s Counsel also disputed the Husband’s Counsel’s submission that the Wife should have raised the issue that she was mentally incapable at the time of the mediation and the mediators would have ceased the mediation session. The Wife’s Counsel submitted that this was speculative and that a person who is mentally incapacitated would not know when their free will was overborne in the same way that a mad person would not admit that he or she was mad.

### Husband took advantage of Wife’s mental condition

47     The Wife’s Counsel also submitted that there was objective evidence of the circumstances of the mediation session which had exacerbated the Wife’s mental condition and impaired her ability to make decisions and give informed consent to the terms of the Settlement Agreement. However, when I asked if the Wife was relying on undue influence or duress, the Wife’s Counsel responded that the Wife was not relying on either.

48     Instead, the Wife’s Counsel submitted that the Husband was a dominant personality and often belittled the Wife throughout the marriage and in front of the children. This led to the Wife suffering from low self worth and she was suicidal[^9]. It was submitted that from 9.30am to 9.00pm on the day of the mediation, the Husband took unfair advantage of the Wife’s mental condition which had affected her ability to make decisions at that point in time.

49     The Wife’s Counsel elaborated that prior to the start of the mediation, the Husband had recounted the family issues and past events during the course of the 27 year marriage to trigger the Wife’s mental condition as he was fully aware that the Wife suffers from a long standing medical condition (depression and alcohol abuse) – see paragraph 65 of the written submissions. The Wife’s Counsel submitted that the Wife was also traumatised by what the Husband had said to her at the start of the session[^10], whereby the Wife stated that the Husband had told the mediator that he had lodged several police reports against the Wife and what their son and daughter had said about her. All this contributed to her long standing medical condition and alcohol abuse.

50     The Wife’s Counsel also referred to paragraphs 8 to 19 of the Wife’s First Affidavit dated 24 July 2019 (P1), of the Wife’s account of being belittled by the Husband. The Wife’s Counsel also referred to the Wife’s discovery of the Husband’s adultery at the beginning of 2017 over which the Wife had confronted the Husband at his office. This led to the Husband physically abusing her and the photographs of this abuse were exhibited at pages 26 to 29 of P1.

51     The Wife’s Counsel also referred to paragraph 43 of P1, where the Wife stated that the frequency, duration and setting of the mediation session had exacerbated her mental condition and that she was always on the verge of nervous breakdown during the mediation session, which caused her free will to be overborne when she consented to the Settlement Agreement.

52     The Husband’s Counsel responded that the mediators held many private caucusing sessions so there was no unfair advantage taken of the Wife. The Husband’s Counsel submitted that the mediation was carried out according to the rules of the SMC which are quite stringent and was fair to both parties. There was also no evidence shown at the time of the mediation that the Wife was not capable of making a decision.

53     The Husband’s Counsel also referred to paragraphs 20 to 25 of their written submissions on the issue of unfair advantage and the Court’s power to set aside the 22 April 2019 AM Consent Order. The Husband’s Counsel submitted that the Court’s power to set aside a Consent Order is limited. The Husband’s Counsel further submitted that no unfair advantage was taken over the Wife because this case involved 2 independent mediators and there were at least 2 experienced Counsel each on both sides.

### Part Performance

54     The Husband’s Counsel also submitted that the Wife had part performed the Settlement Agreement and the 22 April 2019 AM Consent Order as the Wife had informed that she wished to keep the \[_address redacted_\] property and the Husband had already transferred the first tranche of $500,000 to her under the same. The Husband’s Counsel further submitted that the Wife had also been receiving the monthly allowance from the Husband since April 2019 under the 22 April 2019 AM Consent Order. This monthly allowance was agreed at the Wife’s request.

55     On the issue of part performance or part execution of the 22 April 2019 AM Consent Order, the Wife’s Counsel submitted that there was no active performance on the part of the Wife. The Wife had indicated that she wanted to keep the \[_address redacted_\] property because she was in fear that she would have nowhere else to stay if the Husband was to chase her out of the current residence (the matrimonial home). In addition, the receipt of the sum of $500,000 and the monthly allowances were also not active steps taken by the Wife.

56     However, the Wife’s Counsel informed that they could not verify and had no instructions if the Wife had been receiving the monthly allowances. The Wife’s Counsel further submitted that if the Court deemed the transfer of the $500,000 was partial execution, this was not a bar to setting aside the 22 April 2019 AM Consent Order because this payment was not irreversible.

**_the husband had failed to make full and frank disclosure of his assets_**

57     The Wife’s Counsel also submitted that the Husband had failed to make full and frank disclosure of material facts relevant to the actual value of the total pool of matrimonial assets for the mediation. The value of the total pool of matrimonial assets discussed at the mediation was approximately $8.9 million. The Wife claims that the total value for the pool should have been at approximately $10.6 million as stated in the Wife’s Fifth Affidavit dated 30 January 2020 in P5. The Wife’s Counsel submitted that the difference is about $1.7 million which is not negligible and the setting aside of the 22 April 2019 AM Consent Order would be fair and reasonable in the present case.

58     I noted that the Wife had stated[^11] that she was only shown the table of the Husband’s assets which was described as “Table of Agreed Matrimonial Assets” on 12 April 2019 at the mediation itself (the Table is exhibited at page 43 of P1).

59     However, this was disputed by the Husband’s Counsel who submitted that the Husband had given a copy of this table on a Without Prejudice basis to the Wife’s Former Counsel in the lead up to the mediation in January 2019 (see paragraph 27 of the written submissions). The Husband’s Counsel submitted that the same table was produced at the mediation and therefore, the Husband had made full and frank disclosure.

60     However, the Wife’s Counsel submitted that the Husband had failed to make full and frank disclosure of several items in the said Table: (i) No valuations were provided for the 6 properties (items 1 to 6) or the 2 cars (items 7 & 8); (ii) Or on item 9 – the Husband’s law practice, which was valued at $126,202.75. The Wife’s Counsel submitted that this figure was plucked out of thin air and there was no document available to verify this sum and also (iii) for the shares (listed in items 12 to 14).

### Table of Assets

61     In response, the Husband’s Counsel submitted that the title of the table was “Agreed Matrimonial Pool of Assets List With Valuation” (“Table of Assets”). The columns in the table showed “Husband’s valuation sums” and “Wife’s valuation sums” with the final column as “Value to be agreed”. The Husband’s Counsel submitted that by the time the mediation was held on 12 April 2019, there were agreed values for the list of assets for the total pool of matrimonial assets.

62     The Husband’s Counsel also disputed that no documents were produced for the Husband’s law practice and valuations of the 6 properties and submitted that this was done by exchange of letters. The Husband’s Counsel referred to the letter dated 14 January 2019 exhibited in the Wife’s First Affidavit (P1) at pages 96 to 104. This was followed by a round of questions raised by the Wife’s Former Counsel through several letters as informal discovery and interrogatories. The Husband’s Counsel responded on 8 April 2019 and that was when the final agreed table was sent to the Wife’s Former Counsel on 11 April 2019. The Husband’s Counsel submitted that this was same table that was used for the mediation on 12 April 2019.

### Valuation of the 6 properties

63     The Wife’s Counsel submitted that the valuation of the 6 properties listed in the Table of Assets were based on the Husband’s calculations. In addition, the Wife was challenging the property listed at item 5 (“Property 5”) for which the Husband took out a mortgage loan. The Wife produced a valuation report[^12] where the value was given at $2.3 million and the mortgage amount was listed at $985,267.85. The Wife claimed that this mortgage loan was taken out in 2018 after the Husband knew about the Wife’s intention to commence divorce proceedings. Therefore, the Wife was of the view that the full value of $2.3 million should have been put in the total pool and not the net value of $1.3 million and that the Husband should be asked to provide an explanation as to why he took out this loan.

64     The Husband’s Counsel informed that the Husband had taken out the mortgage loan to set up a Trust Fund for the 3 children. This loan was taken out before the Wife filed for divorce. The Husband’s Counsel submitted that the Trust Deed dated 28 September 2018 was sent to the Wife’s Former Counsel on 8 April 2019 and that this Trust Deed showed that the trust had been set up before the Writ of Divorce was filed on 17 October 2018.

65     However, the Wife’s Counsel maintained that this mortgage loan was only taken out 7 days before the commencement of the divorce to reduce the total pool of matrimonial assets. The Husband had therefore listed the property as being worth about $1.3 million when the valuation was that it was worth $2.3 million as the Husband had discounted the mortgage loan of about $1 million. The Wife’s Counsel submitted that even if the Trust Deed was dated 28 September 2018, the Husband already had notice of the Wife’s intention to file for divorce as early as April 2018. So there was a clear intention by the Husband to reduce the pool of assets. The Wife’s Counsel submitted that this property was purchased in 2010 and fully paid up. That was why the Wife was of the view that there was no necessity for the Husband to take up the mortgage loan.

66     The Wife’s Counsel also challenged the property listed at Item 6 of the Table of Assets and produced a valuation at page 177 of the Wife’s First Affidavit dated 24 July 2019 (P1). The valuation provided in P1 was in Malayan Ringgit (MYR) and the Wife’s Counsel submitted that there was no evidence to show how the Husband came to the figure in the Table of Assets (see page 43 of P1) in the sum of $326,498.84.

67     The Husband’s Counsel explained that the figures given by the Husband was between $296,817.13 (minimum) and $356,180.55 (maximum). In addition, the figure given at page 43 of P1 in the sum of $326,498.84 was provided under the Wife’s column. The Husband’s Counsel submitted that this figure was derived from the addition of the minimum and maximum figures provided by the Husband and divided by 2.

### Valuation of the Husband’s law practice

68     The Wife’s Counsel referred to pages 154 & 155 of the Wife’s First Affidavit dated 24 July 2019 (P1) where a valuation was provided by the Husband for the Husband’s law practice. However, the Wife’s Counsel submitted that there was no documentary proof of the Husband’s valuation in the sum of $126,202.75 as handwritten in that document. The Wife’s Counsel submitted that the correct valuation should have been at $245,700.75 and not $126,202.75 as was stated in the Table of Assets, the difference being $119,498.

69     The Wife’s Counsel submitted that firstly, the valuation of the Husband’s law practice was not based on an independent valuation but on the Husband’s own valuation. The Husband signed off at the end of the accounting statement and it is unsure whether this had been audited. Secondly, the values stated in the valuation statement was not a true reflection of the Husband’s earnings based on the Husband’s assets, as the earnings do not match his assets. Therefore, an independent valuer should have been appointed.

70     The Wife’s Counsel submitted that based on pages 154 and 155 of P1, the Wife had taken the net surplus figure of $79,498 on page 154 and added the total assets of $166,202.75 on page 155, which gave the total value of $245,700.75.

71     The Husband’s Counsel responded that the Husband’s valuation was based on the sum of $75,629.38 (brought forward as at 1 January 2018 on page 155) added to the Net Surplus of $50,573.37 also on page 155 = $126,202.75. The Husband’s Counsel also submitted that the Wife had the opportunity to ask for this information prior to and during the time of the mediation but she had failed to do so.

### REX Shares

72     The Wife’s Counsel submitted that the Husband had also failed to disclosure his involvement in the company known as REX. The Wife alleged that the Husband was involved in the transactional contracts entered into with REX.

73     Therefore, the Wife’s Counsel challenged the Husband’s valuation of the REX shares as correct and accurate. This was because the document exhibited at page 222 of the Wife’s First Affidavit dated 24 July 2019 (P1) was merely handwritten and the basis for the valuation of the shares was unknown. The Wife’s Counsel also questioned the Husband’s financial involvement in REX and whether he was not solely a shareholder. Finally, the Wife’s Counsel claimed that these documents were only provided to the Wife by the Husband’s lawyers two days before the mediation, that is on 8 April 2019.

74     This was disputed by the Husband’s Counsel who referred to a letter dated 22 February 2019 sent to the Wife’s Former Counsel which had provided these documents.

75     The Wife’s Counsel reiterated that the Wife had no information of the nature of Husband’s involvement in REX but she knew that the Husband had been earning income from projects with REX.

**_the husband had dissipated assets that should have been included in the total pool of matrimonial assets_**

76     The Wife’s Counsel also submitted that the Husband had failed to account for bank withdrawals up to the value of $197,898.57 (see paragraphs 53 to 59 of the written submissions) and that this amount should be put back into the total pool of matrimonial assets. The Wife’s Counsel also asked for the Husband to produce his bank account statements for 6 months for all his disclosed bank accounts from April 2018 to November 2018.

77     The Wife’s Counsel submitted that the Husband’s banks statements showed that there were large sums of withdrawals from the Husband’s bank accounts made between November 2018 to January 2019 amounting to $197,898.57 over the span of 3 months. It was submitted that these withdrawals remained unknown and unexplained even though the Husband was given an opportunity to provide details of these withdrawals prior to the Wife’s application to set aside the 22 April 2019 AM Consent Order.

78     In response to my query, the Wife’s Counsel informed that they had obtained the bank statements showing these withdrawals from the Husband’s lawyers. Whilst the Wife’s Counsel confirmed that these were the same bank statements provided at the mediation on 12 April 2019, it was submitted that the Husband was dissipating his assets and that the sum of $197,898.57 should have been part of the total matrimonial pool.

79     The Wife’s Counsel also submitted that adverse inference should be drawn against the Husband as, prior to the mediation, the Husband only disclosed his bank accounts for 3 months from November 2018 to January 2019 and that this was disproportionate given the total value of the matrimonial assets in this case of about $8.9 million. The Wife’s Counsel submitted that according to the Practice Directions (“PD”) on Affidavits of Assets and Means in Paragraph 21(2)(m) and (3), the Husband should have disclosed more than 3 months of his bank statements.

80     I noted that under PD Paragraph 21(2)(m) the Husband was required to disclose the past 3 months of his bank statements and under PD Paragraph 21(3) the Parties may apply for further discovery under Rule 63 of the FJR (which provides for discovery in ancillary matters hearings).

81     In response to my query on whether the Husband was asked to provide his bank statements for more than 3 months, the Wife’s Counsel admitted that he had not but submitted that he should have provided more than 3 months as 3 months was disproportionate to the value of the assets in this case.

82     The Husband’s Counsel informed that directions were only given for Parties to exchange 3 months of bank statements and the Husband had done so as directed. The Husband’s Counsel objected to further discovery of the Husband’s bank statements because this matter had been dealt with during the mediation and there had been many opportunities for the Wife to ask for all this earlier, which she had failed to do. The Husband’s Counsel submitted that this was actually an attempt at discovery and could only be done if the Court decided to set aside the 22 April 2019 AM Consent Order.

83     The Husband’s Counsel further submitted that there had already been discovery and interrogatories across 4 months between January 2019 and April 2019 and that the Husband had furnished all relevant documents requested by the Wife’s Former Counsel. Therefore, there was no absence of full and frank disclosure by the Husband (see paragraph 28(g) of the written submissions).

**_counsels’ reference to the case law regarding consent orders_**

84     The Wife’s Counsel referred to paragraphs 23 to 35 of the written submissions for the case law on setting aside Consent Orders in particular, to the cases of _AOO v AON <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGCA 51</span>, UMV v UMW <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGFC 60</span>_ and _Lee Ming Jai v Chua Cheow Koon <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGHC 275</span>_.

85     In citing the case of _AOO v AON_, the Wife’s Counsel submitted that the absence of full and frank disclosure by the Husband, could be ground for setting aside the 22 April 2019 AM Consent Order.

86     In citing the case of _UMV v UMW_, the Wife’s Counsel noted that the District Judge (“DJ”) in that case, had set out the basis or grounds for setting aside a Consent Order. Of the several grounds set out by the DJ, the Wife’s Counsel was relying on: (a) that the Husband took unfair advantage of the Wife; (b) there was objective evidence of the Wife’s medical condition and (c) the medical reports showed the Wife’s inability to make a decision at the time of the mediation.

87     The Wife’s Counsel also referred to the case of _Lee Ming Jai v Chua Cheow Koon <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGHC 275</span>_ where the Honourable Justice Choo Han Teck stated that what the Court should be alert to, is that one party should not take an unfair advantage over the other party in the course of negotiating and settling the terms of the agreement (see paragraph 34 of the written submissions).

88     The Wife’s Counsel also referred to their supplementary written submissions citing the case of _BMI v BMJ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 112</span>_, the Malaysian case of _Lim Thian Hock v Lim Choon Hiok <span class="citation">\[2014\] 9 MLJ 1</span>_ and _Cheong Kim Seah v Lim Poh Choo \[1992\] 2 SLR (R) 599_.

89     The Wife’s Counsel relied on the case of _BMI v BMJ (High Court decision)_ for the proposition that section 112(4) of the Women’s Charter allowed a 2nd bite of the cherry to a limited extent citing 2 of the 4 permissible grounds set out in that case as (i) where one party had taken unfair advantage over the other in negotiating and settling the terms of a consent judgment and (ii) fraudulent non-disclosure by the Husband.

90     The Wife’s Counsel relied on the case of _Cheong Kim Seah_ for the submission that the Wife’s lack of mental capacity impugned on her ability to properly instruct her Counsel. That case also went on to say that this thereby implied that \[the Petitioner’s\] Counsel were acting without authority and thus were in breach of their professional duties and responsibilities (see paragraphs 9 to 11 of the supplementary written submissions).

91     Finally, the Wife’s Counsel relied on the case of _Lim Thian Hock_ on the test to be applied to set aside an Order which cited the English case of _Masterman-Lister v Brutton \[2003\] 3 All ER 162 CA._ At paragraphs 13 to 19 of the supplementary written submissions, the Wife’s Counsel submitted that the 22 April 2019 AM Consent Order could be set aside (i) even where the Wife’s lack of capacity was unknown to anyone at the time of the mediation and (ii) there is a public interest in the protection of vulnerable people who lack the mental capacity to conduct litigation which overrides the public interest of certainty and finality in litigation.

92     The Wife’s Counsel further submitted at paragraphs 20 to 21 of the supplementary written submissions (citing _Dunhill v Burgin \[2012\] EWCA Civ 397 CA)_ that:

> If I accepted that “_the Wife’s mental capacity to give instructions was impaired at the time the Settlement Agreement was entered into and that the Wife’s informed consent was vitiated, then it would follow that the fact the Wife was represented by solicitors at the time where the Settlement Agreement was entered into is immaterial._

> _This is because the Wife could never have had given instructions to her previous solicitors and this would follow that her previous solicitors would not have had the authority to act for the Wife. In other words, the chain of instructions is broken and the AM order should be set aside on this very basis.”_

93     The Husband’s Counsel relied on largely the same cases being _Lee Ming Jai v Chua Cheow Koon <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGHC 275</span>; AOO v AON <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGCA 51</span>; TLJ v TLK <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGFC 26</span>; BMI v BMJ \[2018\] 1 SLR and UMW v UMV <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGFC 60</span>._

94     In summary, the Husband’s Counsel submitted that, in relation to the above case law:

> i.     Based on _Lee Ming Jai’s case_, section 112(4) of the Women’s Charter should not be construed as an invitation to revise the terms of a Settlement Agreement merely so that the terms appear more equitable in the objective opinion of the Court;

> ii.     Based on _AOO and TLJ’s cases_, the Judge is entitled to assume that parties of full age and capacity know what is in their best interest, especially when they are represented by solicitors;

> iii.     There were 4 agreements signed, including the Settlement Agreement and an earlier Consent Order regarding the youngest child. The Wife was represented by the same Counsel throughout and shown to be of sound mind in executing these 4 agreements;

> iv.     There were also 2 experienced mediators at the mediation session on 12 April 2019 who are also senior practitioners and that neither the Wife nor the Wife’s Former Counsel, gave any indication that the Wife’s judgement was impaired in any way; and

> v.     Based on _BMI’s (CA decision) and UMW’s cases_, the Court should be slow to re-open the Settlement Agreement unless there was clear evidence that the non-disclosure was fraudulent, that there is a need for finality unless the fraud is clearly established and that the Court would have made a substantially different order if proper disclosure had been made.

**_My reference to the Case Law regarding Consent Orders_**

95     I noted that it was not disputed that under section 112(4) of the Women’s Charter (“WC”), a Consent Order can be set aside. However, in addition to consideration of the cases cited by both Counsel, I also noted that neither Counsel referred to the Court of Appeal (“CA”) landmark cases of _AYM vs AYL <span class="citation">\[2013\] 1 SLR 924</span>_ which set out the guiding principles on the application of section 112(4) WC and _Surindar Singh s/o Jaswant Singh v Sita Jaswant Kaur <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGCA 37</span>_ which referred to both _AOO v AON’s_ case and _Lee Ming Jai’s_ case, on the weight to be given to Settlement Agreements.

96     In _AYM vs AYL_, the CA had stated, _inter alia_ and as applicable to this case, that under section 112(4) WC:

> i.     The Court’s power to vary under section 112(4) has limited operation where the Order of Court was premised on a Consent Order entered into between the Parties themselves to preserve the principles of freedom and sanctity of contract \[15\]

> ii.     However, in the uniquely matrimonial context, the CA recognised specific vitiating factors such as misrepresentation, mistake, duress, undue influence, unconscionability as well as illegality and public policy \[15\]

> iii.     The Court has no power to vary a Consent Order that has been fully implemented except in the limited case of fraud. However, the standard of proof of fraud is a very high one and not easy to satisfy \[23/30\]

> iv.     That an absence of full and frank disclosure of material facts by one of the parties might result in a Consent Order being set aside by the Court \[31\]

> v.     The CA also observed that the Appellant was attempting to obtain a further amount because the matrimonial assets were worth more than the Parties had originally thought. The CA considered such attempts to undermine the finality of Orders to be wholly undesirable as well as unmeritorious \[33\].

97     In the case of _Surindar Singh s/o Jaswant Singh v Sita Jaswant Kaur_, which was a long marriage of almost 30 years, the Parties had agreed to a Settlement Agreement after mediation. However, the Wife subsequently decided that she did not wish to be bound by the terms of the Settlement Agreement. The Husband then filed a summons for the Settlement Agreement to be recorded as an Order of Court.

98     The Appeal Judge held that the Settlement Agreement was binding at the time it was signed but “_found that the division proposed in the Settlement Agreement was not just and equitable because the Husband would receive 68% of the assets while the Wife would only receive 32% of them_” \[12\].

99     The Judge also found that this proportion did not include the other assets disclosed by the Husband and Wife, which were not provided for in the Settlement Agreement. As such, the Appeal Judge declined to give the Settlement Agreement conclusive weight and awarded equal share of the assets to each party. The Husband appealed against this Order.

100    The CA noted that a senior lawyer had been appointed as the mediator. In addition, both Parties were represented by Counsel at the full day mediation. The CA said that the Settlement Agreement was a contract for a legal purpose entered into by two mentally capable adults, legally advised, after long negotiations and was therefore legally binding.

101    The CA took special note of the fact that the Settlement Agreement resulted from a mediation process during which the Parties had independent advice. The CA said that the Court would attach significant, if not conclusive weight, to the agreement unless there are good and substantial grounds for concluding that to do so would result in an injustice.

102    Thus, I noted that the guiding principles from the above case law is that, for the Wife’s application to set aside the 22 April 2019 AM Consent Order to succeed, I needed to decide whether:

> a)     I accepted that the Wife’s mental condition was such that she was unable to make decisions and give informed consent at the mediation session on 12 April 2019 and that she did not have the capacity to agree to the terms of the Settlement Agreement on which the 22 April 2019 AM Consent Order was based; or

> b)     There was fraudulent non-disclosure and dissipation of assets by the Husband that should have been put into the Table of Assets used at the mediation session and the Husband’s fraudulent behaviour had resulted in an injustice to the Wife; or

> c)     The Husband had taken unfair advantage over the Wife in the course of negotiating and settling the terms of the Settlement Agreement on which the 22 April 2019 AM Consent Order was based, which had resulted in an injustice to the Wife.

## MY ASSESSMENT

**_Wife’s Mental Condition_**

103    I dealt with the Wife’s Mental Condition in 3 parts:

> i.     Wife’s Mental Condition before the mediation session;

> ii.     Wife’s Mental Condition at the mediation session on 12 April 2019; and

> iii.     Whether the Wife had the mental capacity to agree to the terms of the Settlement Agreement.

### Wife’s Mental Condition before the mediation session

104    I noted that in Dr D’s medical report at page 65 of the Wife’s First Affidavit dated 24 July 2019 (P1), it was stated at paragraph 7 that one reason for the Wife’s filing the Writ of Divorce was because her “_psychologist suggested to her that her illness has become protracted because of her sufferings in the marriage_”.

105    The Wife described at paragraphs 14 to 18 of her First Affidavit dated 24 July 2019 (P1), how during the 27-year marriage, she was a full-time housewife and had taken good care of the 3 children. In this regard, the Wife produced 10 pages of typewritten notes of the achievements of her 3 children which, as it showed that the age of the youngest child was then 20 years, I took to be current as at 2018 when the Wife filed for divorce. These typewritten notes were exhibited at pages 31 to 42 of P1 and showed that the Wife must have kept detailed records of the 3 children’s achievements over the years up to the time she filed for divorce in 2018.

106    The Wife also stated at paragraph 36 of P1 that “_Until today, I still go for treatments at IMH with medication and counselling_”. The Wife repeated this in paragraph 18 of her Second Affidavit dated 25 September 2019 (P2), that “_I was and still am a patient undergoing treatment at the Institute of Mental Health. I must say that I was at my worst during the entire duration of the divorce proceedings. I did not attend treatments and take my medication regularly as I was mentally unwell and emotionally wrecked_.”

107    The Wife had also attached the list of her visits to IMH from 2012 to 2018 at pages 54 to 57 of P1. In that list, the Wife had recorded that she had made 14 visits in 2018 from March 2018 to November 2018. I noted that the Writ of Divorce was filed by the Wife on 17 October 2018 and that the Wife had made a visit to IMH the week after, i.e. on 25 October 2018.

108    In response to my query, the Wife’s Counsel informed that the Wife only made two visits after filing the Writ (i.e. the visits on 25 October 2018 and 8 November 2018) and that the Wife had not made any visits in 2019 before the mediation session because she was so traumatised by the divorce proceedings. The Wife’s Counsel also submitted that after 8 November 2018, the Wife stopped her treatment sessions at the IMH which had therefore exacerbated her medical condition on the day of the mediation. I noted that the mediation session (12 April 2019) was held about 6 months after the Wife had filed the Writ of Divorce.

109    It is clear from pages 54 to 57 of P1 that the Wife had made 19 visits to the IMH in 2012, 12 visits in 2013, 24 visits in 2014, 10 visits in 2015, 7 visits in 2016, 9 visits in 2017 and 14 visits in 2018. I was struck by the fact that after making 14 visits to the IMH for 2018, which is more than 1 visit per month, the Wife had not made any visits to the IMH between 8 November 2018 and 12 April 2019.

110    I noted that the Wife also did not produce any list for her visits to the IMH in 2019. The only information provided by the Wife for her visits to the IMH in 2019, was from the medical report dated 6 September by Dr C of the IMH, which stated that the Wife was last seen at the IMH on 7 August 2019. However, the Wife did not provide any report or assessment made by Dr C or any of her attending doctors at the IMH, as to the Wife’s mental state prior to the mediation session on 12 April 2019.

111    I also noted that in P2 at paragraph 27, the Wife stated that she did not give her consent to the 5 documents listed in the Husband’s Second Affidavit dated 8 August 2018 (D2) as “_I was mentally unwell during the divorce proceedings leading up to the mediation session on 12 April 2019._”

112    I further noted that one of these 5 documents was the Consent Order issued on 26 February 2019 with regard to the youngest child. During the discussions with regard to this Consent Order, the Wife was represented by the same Counsel who represented her at the mediation session on 12 April 2019. However, the Wife did not challenge this Consent Order dealing with her youngest child.

113    In addition, I noted that the Wife also stated that at the custody hearing for the youngest child (the records show that this was held on 26 February 2019), the Judge initially ordered the exchange of documents for the period of 6 months immediately preceding the date of divorce.

114    The Wife recalled that the Husband corrected this and informed the Judge that it should only be for 3 months. The Wife stated that “\[I\] _was appalled. The short duration in the exchange of documents clearly put me in a disadvantaged position_.” The Wife further recalled that she had therefore told her Former Counsel “_that I wanted him to request for the \[Husband’s\] bank statements for at least 6 months but all these was not done_.”[^13]

115    In my view, after having decided to file for divorce on 17 October 2018, and after making 2 more visits on 25 October 2018 and 8 November 2018 to the IMH, the Wife had failed to provide any reason why she could not have continued with her treatment at the IMH between 8 November 2018 and the mediation session on 12 April 2019.

116    I was also of the view that the Wife had not provided any evidence to show that her failure to continue with her treatment at the IMH between 8 November 2018 and 12 April 2019, had exacerbated her medical condition on the day of the mediation. In fact, the Wife’s recollection of her request for the Husband’s bank statements showed that she was capable of coherent thinking in spite of her failure to continue with her treatment at the IMH.

### Wife’s Mental Condition at the mediation session on 12 April 2019

117    I noted that the Wife had, pursuant to directions given at a case conference on 15 October 2019, provided her Third Affidavit dated 14 November 2019 (P3), enclosing the correspondence between the Wife’s Counsel and the Wife’s Former Counsel regarding the Wife’s allegations against her Former Counsel as stated in paragraph 19 of her Second Affidavit dated 25 September 2019 (P2). I chose not to refer to these correspondences in my assessment of the Wife’s mental condition and capacity to agree to the Settlement Agreement, but to rely solely on what the Wife herself stated in her narration of the events on 12 April 2019.

118    The basis of the state of the Wife’s mental condition at the mediation session on 12 April 2019, was the Wife’s account of what had happened as given to Dr D on 4 June 2019, as well as the accounts in her Affidavits (as will be referred to below in the Wife’s First Affidavit dated 24 July 2019 (P1), the Wife’s Second Affidavit dated 25 September 2019 (P2) and the Wife’s Fourth Affidavit dated 6 December 2019 (P4)).

119    In Dr D’s medical report at paragraph 9 in page 65 of P1, Dr D opined that the Wife “_went into the multiple mediation sessions weakened and emotionally vulnerable as well as exacerbating her psychiatric condition while she was still receiving treatment from IMH_”.

120    For the mediation session, at paragraph 43 of P1, the Wife stated that “_I must say that the frequency, duration and setting of the mediation sessions with the \[Husband\] had indeed exacerbated my mental condition. I was always on the verge of nervous breakdown during the meditation sessions and it is clear that these overwhelming factors were one of the many reasons that caused my free will to be overborne when I consented to the terms in the Settlement Agreement that eventually formed the orders in the AM Order_.”

121    I noted that it was not disputed that the mediation session on 12 April 2019 spanned a full day of about 12 hours. It struck me that the Wife was able to make it through this full day mediation session without disclosing her drinking or without insisting that the session be stopped or suspended because she was unable to continue even though she was “always on the verge of a nervous breakdown”.

122    It also struck me that despite claiming that she was in a mental condition of depression and alcohol abuse, this did not seem to affect the Wife’s’ ability to recall how she was traumatised by the Husband during the mediation session, of being put in a separate room away from the Husband and the mediator shuttling to and from both rooms, as described by the Wife in paragraph 7, paragraphs 15 and 16 and paragraph 22 of P2.

123    For example, the Wife was able to recall in paragraph 7 of P2 that “_I asked that if I could leave the mediation room and be on my own. We then went to separate rooms to discuss with our lawyers. My lawyer…..was the one who suggested to ask for $5.7 million… I was given false hope thinking that \[Wife’s Former Counsel\] was taking care of my welfare… I did not want to go back to the mediation room with the \[Husband\] and the mediator had to shuttle between the \[Husband’s\] room and my room to conduct the mediation._”

124    The Wife further recalled in paragraphs 15 and 16 of P2 that “_During the 12 April 2019 mediation, the \[Husband\] told the mediator that he had lodged several police reports against me in December 2018_.” The Wife also recalled that “_During the initial part of the mediation on 12 April 2019, the \[Husband\] started to capitalize on my weak mental and medical condition. The \[Husband\] started by saying my son, Child E told him…. The \[Husband\] continued by telling the mediator that my daughter, Child F told him…”_

125    Further, in paragraph 22 of P2, the Wife was able to recall that “_When the \[Husband\] levied accusations against me during the mediation session on 12 April 2019, I would look at my previous lawyers in surprise of his false accusations but my lawyers would continue and allow him to intimidate me and my previous lawyers would gesture to me to keep quiet and let him talk_.”

126    With regard to P4, the Wife stated at paragraphs 7 to 10 that her “_recollection of what had transpired at the mediation is in fragments as \[I\] was mentally unwell and in a fuddled state of mind_.” Nonetheless the Wife was able to recall that her Former Counsel “_kept telling me that $2.55 million was a good deal_” \[paragraph 7\]; that she hugged her Counsel, the Husband’s Counsel and the mediators after signing the Settlement Agreement \[paragraph 8\]; and that she asked for a time-out so as not to be present in the same room as the Husband \[paragraph 10\].

127    As the Husband’s Counsel submitted that the final address at the mediation was made by the Wife herself, I directed that the Wife was to file a further Affidavit to confirm if the Wife had indeed made the final address at the mediation. This was done and the Wife’s Affidavit dated 30 January 2020 (P5), was filed.

128    The Wife stated in P5 that “_it was highly implausible that \[I\] had made a final statement at the end of the mediation on 12 April 2019_” (see paragraphs 5 and 6 of P5). In contrast, the Husband’s Affidavit filed on 3 April 2020 (D7), giving his account of the events at the mediation session, was that after the signing of the Settlement Agreement, it was the Wife who asked if she could say something (see paragraphs 34 to 36 of D7) and then proceeded to make a final statement.

129    I did not place weight on the 4 medical reports submitted by the Wife, in particular Dr D’s report dated 30 June 2019 because Dr D’s assessment was based on the Wife’s mental state as at 4 June 2019, and this was the first time that Dr D had seen and assessed the Wife. That was nearly 2 months after the mediation session on 12 April 2019 and based on the Wife’s narration of the events at the mediation session itself.

130    In my view, the Wife’s ability to recall what the Husband said, the mediators actions of shuttling from the two rooms, how the Husband had levied accusations against her, how she was filled with “false hope” and the sum of $2.55 million that was discussed during the mediation session, showed that the Wife’s mental condition was not in such state that she was unable to comprehend what was taking place during the mediation session. The Wife’s claim was primarily based on medical examinations conducted in June 2019, which was nearly 2 months later. I found this to be a retrospective claim with insufficient evidence to support it.

### Whether the Wife had the mental capacity to agree to the terms of the Settlement Agreement

131    I noted that the Settlement Agreement had included a clause for the Wife to move out of the matrimonial home by 29 February 2020. As the Wife’s Counsel had submitted that the Wife was not capable of negotiating the move out date of 29 February 2020, I directed that the Wife was to file another Affidavit to confirm if she had indeed chosen the move out date of 29 February 2020 and negotiated the terms for her monthly allowance at the mediation. This was done and the Wife’s Affidavit dated 18 February 2020 (P6) was filed.

132    The Wife stated in P6 that whilst she did not apply her mind to her move out date, she gave “_a date after Chinese New Year so \[I\] would not get chased out so soon and that happened to be the last day of February 2020_”. I was struck by the fact that at the mediation session on 12 April 2019, the Wife was sufficiently aware that a date after Chinese New Year of the following year would not be too soon for her to move out.

133    For the terms of the monthly allowance of between $2,450 to $2,950 set out in Clause 5 (3)(a) to (e) of the 22 April 2019 AM Consent Order, the Wife stated in P6 that it was the Husband who had decided on the items and she did not give her informed consent nor make any decision regarding these items. As to whether she had been receiving the monthly allowance to date, the Wife stated in P6 that she does “_not check \[my\] bank account on a regular basis and hence \[I\] would not be able to confirm whether the \[Husband\] has been keeping to the payment and whether \[I\] have been receiving monthly allowance_.”

134    I found this to be a disingenuous statement and not credible. The Wife’s apparent inability to comply with the directions given, was in my assessment, an attempt to present herself as being unable to deal with simple instructions because of her mental condition. In my view, this was incompatible with the Wife’s own narration of being the person who had been able to “_supervise and guide \[her 3 children\] in their homework and school assignments_” (see paragraph 16 of the Wife’s First Affidavit dated 24 July 2019 (P1)) and to keep records of their achievements, to the extent set out in the 10 typewritten pages exhibited at pages 31 to 42 of P1.

### (i)   Under the influence of alcohol

135    I agreed with the Husband’s Counsel that the Wife’s alleged alcoholic condition at the mediation session was self-inflicted. She chose to spike her own water with alcohol throughout the entire day of the mediation session. However, the Wife’s alleged consumption of vodka throughout the mediation process, was clearly not apparent to either side at the time of the mediation as it was not raised by anyone, not even the mediators, who would have stopped the mediation if there was any doubt as to the Wife’s mental state. This is to be distinguished from the Wife’s emotional state as Parties are generally highly emotional during such negotiations.

136    On this point, I referred to the case of _Chan Gek Yong v Violet Netto and Ravi s/o Madasamy both practising as LF Violet Netto <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 208</span>._ In that case the Plaintiff was unrepresented and the Defendants were lawyers. The Plaintiff and Defendants signed a Settlement Agreement after a mediation session by two SMC appointed mediators, one of whom was a hospital doctor and the other, a lawyer.

137    The Plaintiff’s case was that _inter alia_, the Settlement Agreement was invalid because on the day of the mediation she was unwell and drowsy and giddy because of her medication. Thus, she was not mentally and fully alert when she signed the Settlement Agreement and she did not understand what she was signing.

138    The Honourable Justice Tan Siong Thye held that on the issue of incapacity (referring to the case of _Resorts World at Sentosa Pte Ltd v Lee Fook Khuen <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 173</span> at \[21\]_), the Plaintiff had failed to prove on a balance of probabilities that:

> a)     When she signed the Settlement Agreement she was so mentally incapacitated that she was unable to understand the general nature and effect of the Settlement Agreement and

> b)     The Defendants and Mediators knew of her infirmity.

139    Justice Tan noted that the Plaintiff did not produce any documentary proof that she was suffering from giddiness on the day of the mediation. The medical reports that she had produced were not germane to the proceedings as the records showed that she consulted the doctor months after the date of the mediation. Despite feeling drowsy/giddy as she claimed, the evidence indicated that the Plaintiff was able to conduct herself during the mediation.

140    Justice Tan also noted that it was natural that parties feel anxious during court proceedings and mediation as each party would try to get the best deal for himself/herself. The Plaintiff also did not inform the Defendants or their lawyers or the Mediators that she was suffering from giddiness and drowsiness. Justice Tan held that even if the Plaintiff was belabouring under an infirmity which so impaired her mental capacity during the mediation such that she was not capable of understanding the general nature and effect of the Settlement Agreement, neither the Defendants or their lawyers or the Mediators had knowledge of her infirmity. As such, the incapacity case was not made out.

141    I also noted that the Wife’s Counsel had submitted that, based on the cases of _Masterman-Lister v Brutton_ and _Dunhill v Burgin_, even where the Wife’s lack of capacity was unknown to anyone at the time of the mediation, her inability to give informed consent at the time of the mediation gave rise to a public interest in the protection of vulnerable people which overrides the public interest of certainty and finality in litigation.

142    In my view, the Wife had failed to show that she was in that category of vulnerable persons and her mental condition was such that she was incapable of making decisions and giving informed consent to the Settlement Agreement that was finalised at the mediation session on 12 April 2019.

**_Whether there was fraudulent non-disclosure of assets by the Husband_**

### Table of assets

143    The Husband’s Counsel had disputed that no document was produced for the Husband’s law practice and valuations of the 6 properties and submitted that this was done by exchange of letters as informal discovery and interrogatories. These letters were exhibited in the Wife’s First Affidavit dated 24 July 2019 (P1). The Husband’s Counsel had submitted that following this exchange of letters, the final agreed table was sent to the Wife’s Former Counsel on 11 April 2019, which was the same table that was used for the mediation on 12 April 2019 (at page 43 of P1).

144    I noted that there were 7 letters exhibited in P1. Firstly, by letter dated 14 January 2019 at pages 96 to 104 of P1, the Husband’s Counsel sent Table A to the Wife’s Former Counsel regarding the proposed items for the pool of matrimonial assets. The Wife’s Former Counsel responded by letter dated 30 January 2019 to the Husband’s Counsel setting out the Wife’s proposals as to the valuation of the items in the said Table A. This was exhibited from pages 108 to 116 of P1. The Wife’s Former Counsel also sent another letter dated 22 February 2019 at pages 119 to 140 of P1, attaching the Wife’s supporting documents.

145    The Husband’s Counsel then sent a letter dated 22 February 2019 (at pages 141 to 148 of P1) responding to the Wife’s proposals on the items listed at Table A and attaching the enclosures exhibited from pages 149 to 255 of P1. This included the Husband’s accounts for the valuation of his law practice at pages 154 to 155 of P1.

146    The Wife’s Former Counsel replied by letter dated 18 March 2019 seeking further information from the Husband (see pages 258 to 268 of P1). In this letter, the Wife’s Former Counsel stated that “_In preparation for mediation before the \[SMC\] on 12 April 2019 our client instructs that she requires further documents and information from your client”._ The Wife’s Former Counsel sent another letter dated 4 April 2019 attaching the Wife’s supporting documents exhibited from pages 269 to 630 of P1. These comprised 361 pages of documentary evidence showing the Wife’s monthly expenditure.

147    The Husband’s Counsel responded to the Wife’s Former Counsel on 8 April 2019 also with attachments exhibited from pages 631 to 680 of P1. I noted that this included the Trust Deed dated 28 September 2018 regarding the $1 million Trust Fund to be set up for the 3 children and for which the Husband took up a mortgage loan (the Trust Deed is exhibited at pages 667 to 677 of P1).

148    I was of the view that these exhibits, which were produced in the Wife’s own Affidavit in P1, gave credence to the Husband’s Counsel’s submission that there was in fact informal discovery and interrogatories prior to the mediation session on 12 April 2019. The exchange of these letters with supporting documents that could only have been provided by the Wife to her Former Counsel, also supported the Husband’s position the Wife had known and participated in the discussions leading up to the agreed assets for the Table of Assets used at the meditation session on 12 April 2019.

149    I also took note that the Table of Assets itself that was exhibited at page 43 of P1 had several columns indicating both the Husband’s and Wife’s valuations of the 6 properties, their respective vehicles, the Husband’s law practice, their CPF Funds, their shares and bank accounts. There were also columns for “Basis for value” and “Value to be agreed”. The total valuation of the assets in this table was $8,910,960.82 (“$8.9 million”).

### Valuation of the 6 properties

150    As the Wife had alleged that the value of the matrimonial pool was more than the $8.9 million stated in the Table of Assets, I directed the Wife to provide her estimated total value for the matrimonial pool. The Wife provided a table in her Fifth Affidavit dated 31 January 2020 in P5 at pages 3 to 10.

151    In summary, the Wife stated in P5 that:

> i.     The value of the property at \[_address redacted_\] (**Property 1**) should have been $3.1 million instead of $2.75 million being a difference of $350,000;

> ii.     The value of the property at \[_address redacted_\] (**Property 2**) should have been $1.398 million instead of $1.208 million being a difference of $190,000;

> iii.     The value of the property at \[_address redacted_\] (**Property 3**) should have been $705,000 instead of $700,000 being a difference of $5,000;

> iv.     The value of the property at \[_address redacted_\] (**Property 4**) should have been $310,000 instead of $266,000 being a difference of $44,000;

> v.     The value of the property at \[_address redacted_\] (**Property 5**) should have been $2.3 million instead of $1,314,732.11 being a difference of $985,267.89; and

> vi.     The value of the **Husband’s Law Practice** should have been $245,700.75 instead of $126,202.75 being a difference of $119,498.

> The total difference was therefore estimated at $1,693,765.89.

152    However, the Wife did not state anywhere in P5 that the Husband had failed to disclose any specific asset. Instead, the Wife disagreed with the valuations set out in the Table of Assets used at the mediation session. The bulk of this difference is with regard to the valuation of Property 5, for which the Husband took out a mortgage loan of about $1 million.

153    As noted above, the Table of Assets was agreed to after an exchange of letters including voluminous attachments between the Husband’s Counsel and the Wife’s Former Counsel between January 2019 and April 2019. I noted that the Wife’s initial valuations were set out under cover of the Wife’s Former Counsel’s letter dated 30 January 2019 to the Husband’s Counsel exhibited from pages 108 to 116 of P1 as follows:

> i.     The value of **Property 1** should be $3.3 million;

> ii.     The value of **Property 2** should be $2 million;

> iii.     The value of **Property 3** should be $740,000;

> iv.     The value of **Property 4** should be $290,000;

> v.     The Wife agreed to adopt the Husband’s value for **Property 5** at $1,314,732.11; and

> vi.     The Wife requested for copies of the Profit & Loss statement of the **Husband’s Law Practice** for the past 3 years before she decided on her valuation.

154    Following the Wife’s initial valuations, the continuing correspondence between the Wife’s Former Counsel and the Husband’s Counsel showed that there was negotiation and discussion of all the valuations that were put into the Table of Assets used at the mediation on 12 April 2019.

155    I also noted that in the High Court decision of the case of _BMI v BMJ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 112</span>_ where the Wife was attempting to set aside a Consent Order on the ground that there was fraudulent non-disclosure by the Husband, (then Judicial Commissioner) Justice Valerie Thean held that a deliberate and dishonest non-disclosure would be sufficient to ground fraudulent non-disclosure.

156    Justice Thean stated that fraudulent non-disclosure was a question of fact requiring assessment of the available and admissible evidence and the threshold for fraud was high. Cogent or compelling evidence was required. In that case, the Wife maintained that the Husband had hidden assets or held them through nominees and was thus guilty of non-disclosure. On the facts of that case, Justice Thean found that the Wife’s claims were largely speculative and relied on scant and untested evidence that was not sufficiently cogent.

157    The CA decision of the same case in _BMI v BMJ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 63</span>_ upheld Justice Thean’s decision and held that any non-disclosure that was not fraudulent did not furnish any basis to set aside the Consent Order. The CA said that it would only do so if there was cogent evidence of fraudulent and material non-disclosure by the Respondent. The CA also stated that the threshold for establishing fraud was very high and not easy to satisfy unless there was cogent and compelling evidence.

158    The CA also reiterated that Parties cannot reopen settlements at will or continue to make claims indefinitely for benefits received by the other Party after the division of matrimonial assets has been completed. The CA stated that there is a need for finality, unless fraud is clearly established.

159    In my view, all the valuations that were now being challenged by the Wife, were with regard to items produced prior to and agreed at the mediation itself. In short, the Wife did not produce any supporting evidence of her claim that there was fraudulent non-disclosure by the Husband of his assets. The Wife’s claim, post-mediation, was based on her disagreement as to the valuations of the 5 properties and the Husband’s law practice set out in P5.

### The Mortgage Loan

160    I also directed that the Husband file an Affidavit on the details of the mortgage loan which was taken up with UOB. This was done and the Husband’s Affidavit dated 19 February 2020 (D5) was filed. The Husband stated in D5 that even if the loan amount was put back into the matrimonial pool, the UOB loan would still have appeared on the Table of Assets as his liability to the bank. Hence, it was submitted that the final total value of the matrimonial pool would still have been reduced by the amount of the UOB loan.

161    I noted that in the case of _TNL v TNK <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 15</span>_ the CA set out the guiding principles on dealing with substantial sums expanded by one spouse during the period (a) in which divorce proceedings are imminent or (b) after interim judgement but before the ancillaries are concluded. The CA stated that these sums must be returned to the asset pool if the other spouse is considered to have a putative interest in it and has not agreed, whether expressly or impliedly, to the expenditure either before it was incurred or at any subsequent time.

162    I noted that the Wife had been given notice of the mortgage loan on 8 April 2019 during the negotiations on the Table of Assets to be used at the mediation session on 12 April 2019. The agreed value of Property 5 at the mediation session had already taken into account this loan, as can be seen at the page 43 of P1. As pointed out above, in the Wife’s Former Counsel’s letter dated 30 January 2019, the Wife had agreed to adopt the Husband’s value for Property 5 at $1,314,732.11, which took into account the mortgage loan. In my view, the Wife had therefore expressly agreed to this expenditure.

### Valuation of the Husband’s law practice

163    As there was clearly a need for an explanation on the valuation of the Husband’s law practice, I directed that the Husband file an Affidavit to deal with the Wife’s allegation that the valuation should have been $245,700.75 and not $126,202.75. This was done and the Husband’s Affidavit dated 19 February 2020 (D5) was filed. The Husband stated in D5 that the Wife had incorrectly added the total assets on page 155 of $166,202.75 as she had failed to take into account the total liabilities as well. The Husband went on to explain his computation of the valuation that he had given in the sum of $126,202.75 for the Table of Assets. I was satisfied with the explanation given.

### REX Shares

164    I was of the view that there was a distinction between the Husband acting for REX and whether the Husband had any proprietary interest in REX, for example as co-owner or shareholder of REX. In my view, the latter was relevant for the matrimonial pool. Hence, I directed that the Husband also file an Affidavit to explain his interests regarding REX and the REX shares.

165    This was done and the Husband’s Affidavit dated 29 January 2020 (D4) was filed. The Husband stated in D4 that REX was a public company and explained how he had arrived at the total share value of his 201,548 REX shares. This was in the sum of S$279,067.47 which was the value stated in the Table of Assets. The Husband also stated that he was only a shareholder of REX. I was satisfied with the Husband’s explanation.

166    In my view, the Wife had failed to show that there was fraudulent non-disclosure of assets by the Husband for the Table of Assets used at the mediation session which was the basis of the Settlement Agreement made on 12 April 2019.

**_Whether the Husband had dissipated his assets_**

### Regarding the bank withdrawals

167    I was of the view that as the Husband had complied with the legal requirements for the provision of 3 months of his bank statements, that it was not appropriate to allege, many months later, that he should have provided more. I also noted that in the Wife’s table in her Fifth Affidavit dated 31 January 2020 in P5 at pages 3 to 10, on being directed by me to elaborate on her estimated total value for the matrimonial pool of $10.6 million, the difference was based on the Wife’s increased valuation for 5 properties and the Husband’s law Practice only. There was no mention of adding the alleged dissipated assets of the bank withdrawals in the sum of $197,898.57 into her estimation for the total pool of matrimonial assets.

168    I also referred to the case of _BOR v BOS <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGCA 78</span>_, where the CA observed that not every unexplained withdrawal or decrease in value in a bank account over time will be sufficient to raise a prima facie case of dissipation. Withdrawals of money which may be legitimately explained as personal expenditure should generally be disregarded. Withdrawals which may legitimately be explained as genuine expenditure in business or investments ought similarly to be disregarded. This is necessarily a fact sensitive matter and the Court will consider the evidence in the context of the parties’ habits, lifestyles, business activities and amount of withdrawals in relation to the total value of matrimonial assets in question.

169    I noted that the Wife’s Counsel had confirmed that they had derived this amount of $197,898.57 from the bank statements that were provided to the Wife by the Husband before the mediation session on 12 April 2019.

170    I further noted that the Wife’s Former Counsel had queried the withdrawals from the Husband’s bank accounts in the letter dated 18 March 2019 to the Husband’s Counsel. This was detailed at pages 264 to 268 of P1, which amounts are largely the same amounts being queried by the Wife’s Counsel now for the bank withdrawals amounting to the sum of $197,898.57. In my view, as the Husband’s Counsel had responded to these queries by letter dated 4 April 2019 before the mediation session, the Wife had failed to raise a prima facie case of dissipation.

### Adverse inference

171    The Wife’s Counsel had also referred to paragraphs 36 to 52 of the written submissions for the case of _Koh Bee Choo v Choo Chai Huah <span class="citation">\[2007\] SGCA 21</span>_ that adverse inference should be drawn against the Husband for the absence of full and frank disclosure of the assets owned by the Husband. I noted that the CA in that case stated that for such an allegation to be sustained, the legal burden of proof continues to lie on the Wife.

172    I also referred to the case of _BPC v BPB and another appeal <span class="citation">\[2019\] 1 SLR 608</span>_. In that case, the CA stated that for adverse inference to be drawn, the Court must be satisfied that (a) there is a substratum of evidence which establishes a _prima facie_ case against the person for whom the adverse inference is to be drawn and (b) that person has some particular access to the information that he/she is said to be concealing or withholding.

173    In my assessment, the Wife’s complaint appeared to stem from the fact that the Wife’s Former Counsel did not do what she wanted them to do (for example obtain the Husband’s bank statements for 6 months) or obtain a higher amount for her based on her valuations of what she thought she ought to have received.

174    I also noted that under the 22 April 2019 AM Consent Order based on the Settlement Agreement, the Wife was to receive the sum of $2.55 million from the Husband. Together with her own assets valued at $770,000, this meant that the Wife’s total share was $3.32 million out of the agreed pool of matrimonial assets in the sum of approximately $8.9 million. This sum of $3.32 million is approximately 36% of the total pool of $8.9 million.

175    As stated by the CA in _Surindar Singh’s_ case, where the Wife received 32% under that Settlement Agreement \[55\], “there is judicial recognition that divorce is a very personal matter and there may be private reasons as to why certain concessions were made in reaching a settlement agreement.” The CA in _Surindar Singh’s_ case also referred to _Lee Ming Jai’s_ case quoting _Dean v Dean_ “Where an agreement between parties had been reached at arm’s length and the parties had been separately advised, the agreement itself would be prima facie evidence of the reasonableness of its terms, and a formal discovery would probably be unnecessary.”

176    Although I noted that it did appear, from the documents provided at the hearing, that the Husband did not provide 6 months of his bank statements as requested by the Wife. However, in my view, the Wife’s Counsel had no basis to seek adverse inference to be drawn against the Husband for not providing 6 months of his bank statements. This was tantamount to saying that adverse inference should be drawn against the Husband for failing to provide more than what he was legally required to do.

**_Whether the Husband had taken unfair advantage over the Wife in negotiating and settling the terms of the Settlement Agreement_**

177    The Husband’s Counsel also submitted that the Wife’s Former Counsel would have known of her condition and would have done all necessary things to ensure that she understood the Settlement Agreement at the mediation before she signed it. I noted that in one the letters exchanged prior to the meditation session (the letter dated 4 April 2019 to the Husband’s Counsel), the Wife’s Former Counsel attached the Wife’s receipts for ‘Counselling National Addiction (see pages 269/270 and pages 563 to 583 of the Wife’s First Affidavit (P1)) which gave credence to this.

178    I also noted that the Wife referred to an email sent to her by one of her lawyers at paragraph 24 of her Second Affidavit dated 25 September 2019 (P2). The email itself was exhibited by the Wife at pages 32 to 33 of P2. I noted that the email was actually dated 8 August 2018 and not 31 May 2019 as stated in paragraph 24 of P2 and was therefore sent to the Wife at least 8 months before the mediation session on 12 April 2019. The writer of the email, stated that the Wife’s Former Counsel’s “_professional ethics will not allow him to conform to your Husband’s wishes_”.

179    I noted that the Agreement to Mediate was signed by the Wife and Husband on 27 March 2019[^14]. This was at least 2 weeks before the actual mediation itself. Thus, in my view, the Wife had ample opportunity to seek medical assistance or counselling at the IMH which she failed to do.

180    I also noted that the Settlement Agreement was only signed after a full day mediation before the two SMC appointed mediators and that both the Wife and Husband had independent legal advice throughout. The Settlement Agreement was signed in the presence of the Parties, their Counsel and the two mediators.

181    In addition, there was a 4 month period prior to the mediation session where the Parties’ Counsel had many exchanges on the assets and valuations to be used for the mediation session. As stated above, I found that the Wife had not shown that there was any fraudulent behaviour on the part of the Husband regarding the assets or the valuations in the Table of Assets used at the mediation session.

182    I also noted that during the entire mediation process, the Wife had access not only to her own lawyers but also to the SMC appointed mediators, from whom she could have sought assistance to stop the mediation at any time, which she failed to do.

183    As to the Wife’s consumption of alcohol during the mediation session, the Wife admitted at paragraph 8 of her Fourth Affidavit dated 6 December 2019 (P4), that she had hugged her Counsel, the Husband’s Counsel and one of the mediators after signing the Settlement Agreement on 12 April 2019. In my view, it was not plausible that four lawyers and two mediators would not have noticed that the Wife was under the influence of alcohol throughout the mediation session, and in particular, when the Wife hugged them at the end of the session.

184    In addition, I noted that after the mediation on 12 April 2019, there was a time lapse of 10 days before the 22 April 2019 AM Consent Order was issued. The Wife did not raise any issue during these 10 days.

185    I further noted that under the Settlement Agreement, Clause 5 provided that the Wife was to inform the Husband within 3 months of 12 April 2019, if she wished to keep the \[_address redacted_\] property. The Wife was able to instruct her Former Counsel to inform the Husband of her desire to keep the \[_address redacted_\] property within 10 days of signing the Settlement Agreement and, within one month thereof, to accept payment of the sum of $500,000 in May 2019 as the first tranche of payments under the Settlement Agreement.

186    I also referred to two other cases regarding the issue of Consent Orders. These were _UMM vs UML <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHCF 13</span>_ and _CDV v CDW <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 61</span>._ In _UMM vs UML_, the principles enunciated in the CA case of _AYM vs AYL <span class="citation">\[2013\]1 SLR 924</span>_ were elaborated by the Honourable Justice Debbie Ong, who stated that the Court’s power to set aside or vary a Consent Order on ancillary matters is to be exercised narrowly. The Applicant must prove one of the vitiating factors \[as set out in _AYM v AYL_\].

187    In _UMM’s_ case, the Husband attempted to set aside the AM Consent Court Order on the grounds that he was under duress exerted by the Wife and two children when he signed the 1st DCO. As he was not legally represented, the Husband claimed that they misrepresented the contents of the 1st DCO to him. He also claimed that when he signed the 1st DCO, he was in a despondent state of mind and reeling from emotional turmoil. On the facts of that case, Justice Ong agreed with the DJ that no particulars of the alleged duress or misrepresentation (such as the words used or the specific conduct) were provided.

188    Justice Ong also held that it was a serious matter for someone to sign a legal document before a Commissioner for Oaths or before a lawyer and that the Husband could have sought assistance or expressed that he needed more time to consider the DCOs (noting that more than 1 year had elapsed between the signing of the 1st and 2nd DCOs). Justice Ong further held that regarding the Husband’s submission that the terms of the AM Orders operate oppressively against him and do him injustice, it must be emphasised that Consent Orders are the end of a process of “give and take” to harmoniously resolve a dispute between Parties. Justice Ong also held that the need for finality was a significant consideration.

189    In the most recently reported case on Consent Orders being the case of _CDV v CDW <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 61</span>_, the Honourable (then Judicial Commissioner) Justice Dedar Singh Gill also referred to the CA case of _AYM vs AYL <span class="citation">\[2013\]1 SLR 924</span>_ on the guiding principles for applications to **extend, vary, revoke or discharge** a Consent Order under section 112(4) WC. Justice Singh noted that in the _AYM_ case, the Husband was seeking to undermine the finality of the Consent Order because he wanted to obtain a greater amount as the Matrimonial Home had become worth more.

190    Justice Singh held that the high threshold for invoking s.112 of the WC strikes the appropriate balance between finality and the need to achieve a just and equitable result where the facts of the case warrant it. In deciding to grant a variation application, the Court should scrutinise the precise facts and circumstances to determine whether an applicant is bringing the application in good faith or simply re-opening old wounds and concluded orders. Justice Singh noted that this point was emphasised in _AYM_ where the CA cautioned against frivolous applications that would constitute an abuse of the process of Court.

191    In my view, the Wife had failed to show that the Husband had taken unfair advantage over the Wife in negotiating the terms of the Settlement Agreement or that any injustice had been committed against the Wife which had resulted in the Settlement Agreement.

## MY DECISION

192    Regarding the 5 prayers in **SUM 2543/2019:**

> i.     The Wife’s Counsel had agreed that Prayer 1 of the Wife’s application in SUM 2543/2019 for the 22 April 2019 AM Consent Order to be stayed was redundant;

> ii.     I was of the view that Prayer 2 of the Wife’s application in SUM 2543/2019 for the 22 April 2019 AM Consent Order to be set aside was without merit and therefore dismissed it;

> iii.     As such Prayer 3 of the Wife’s application in SUM 2543/2019 was therefore also dismissed;

> iv.     I was also of the view that the Wife was not entitled to costs under Prayer 4, and awarded costs of $3,000 to be paid by the Wife to the Husband; and

> v.     The Wife’s Counsel informed that no other relief was being sought under Prayer 5 so no order was required for this Prayer.

193    Regarding **SUM 2437/2019** which was filed by the Husband on 18 July 2019, wherein the Husband asked for the following orders:

> Prayer 1: The Wife shall deliver to the Husband within five (5) days from the date of the order made here, the Transfer documents (having previously been delivered to the Wife's solicitors, Messrs Dodwell & Co, on 4 June 2019) duly executed by the Wife and witnessed by the Wife's solicitors and the certificate of correctness duly indorsed by the Wife's solicitors, in respect of the following 2 properties :-

>> (i)    \[_address redacted_\] Property 1; and

>> (ii)   \[_address redacted_\] Property 3.

> Prayer 2: The Registrar, Deputy Registrar or Assistant Registrar of the Family Justice Courts is empowered to execute, sign or indorse the Transfer documents relating to the transfer of the Wife's rights, title and interest in the above mentioned 2 properties to the Husband, upon written confirmation by the Husband's solicitors that the Wife has neglected or failed to do so as ordered in paragraph (1) above.

> Prayer 3: That the signature of the Registrar, Deputy Registrar or Assistant Registrar on the Transfer instruments shall have the same effect as the execution of the Transfer instruments by the Wife and the indorsement of the Wife's solicitors.

> Prayer 4: The Wife pays to the Husband the costs of this application on an indemnity basis.

> Prayer 5: There be such further or other order or relief as the Court deems fit.

194    I granted an Order-In-Terms for Prayers 1, 2 and 3 of SUM 2437/2019.

195     For Prayer 4 on costs: The Wife’s Counsel submitted that if the Husband’s application was granted, that there should be no order as to costs. This was because the Husband’s summons application could have been filed after the Wife’s summons application to set aside the Consent Order, had been dealt with.

196    The Wife’s Counsel submitted that they had put the Husband on notice of the Wife’s intended application through letters (see paragraphs 27 to 30 of the Wife’s first Affidavit dated 24 July 2019 (P1)). Three letters were sent in this regard, 3 June 2019, 21 June 2019 and 25 June 2019, thereby putting the Husband on notice that the Wife was going to apply to set aside the 22 April 2019 AM Consent Order. Therefore, the Wife’s Counsel submitted that SUM 2437/2019 filed by the Husband was an afterthought and had not been necessary.

197    The Husband’s Counsel submitted that the Wife should pay costs to the Husband in the sum of $10,000. I noted that the Husband had also initially filed SUM 2734/2019 on 8 August 2019 to strike out the Wife’s application in SUM 2543/2019. I had granted leave for the withdrawal of this Summons at the hearing on 6 February 2020.

198    I agreed with the Wife’s Counsel that the Husband’s application in SUM 2437/2019 could have been held in abeyance once the Husband had been put on notice of the Wife’s intended application in SUM 2543/2019.

199    Therefore, I was of the view that each Party should bear their own costs for this application.

200     For Prayer 5 on Other Relief: The Husband’s Counsel also sought for an order for an Extension of Time (EOT) of 3 months from the date of my Court Order for the payment of the second tranche in the sum of $500,000 that was due to have been paid in November 2019 to the Wife and for payment of the third tranche in the sum of $342,000 that was due to have been paid on 12 May 2020 to the Wife to be paid 6 months after that i.e. 9 months later. I agreed to the EOT.

201    Accordingly, the Order of Court based on the above reasons, was sent to Parties by RN on 18 August 2020.

## Conclusion

202    On 28 August 2020, the Wife filed an appeal against the whole of my decision given by way of RN on 18 August 2020. I have nothing further to add to my reasons given above.
