Family Law – Guardianship of Infants Act – Access

14 March 2021

### District Judge Cassandra Cheong:

## Introduction

1       This was essentially the Plaintiff Father’s (“the Father”) application for the following orders[^1]:

> (a)     joint custody of the only child of the marriage (“C”) with care and control to the Defendant Mother (“the Mother”) and liberal unsupervised access to the Father.

> (b)     The Mother shall not bring C overseas except with the Father’s consent in writing. Alternatively, either party may bring the child overseas for holidays provided written notification is given to the other party of the travel itinerary including flight details, accommodation and contact details at least one (1) month prior to departure.

2       The Mother disagreed with the Father’s application for liberal unsupervised access, including overseas and overnight access.[^2]

3       After hearing parties’ and reading the reports by the Divorce Support Specialist Agency (“DSSA”), I made the following orders:

> (a)     Parties shall have joint custody of C, with care and control to the Mother.

> (b)     The Father shall have unsupervised access to C on:

>> (i)       Tuesdays from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. at the Garden Room of the Mother’s residence (“the Garden Room”).

>> (ii)       On Saturdays from 10.00 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. at the Garden Room, Petir Park, HillV2, Bukit Panjang Plaza or the RailMall.

>> (iii)       To ensure a gradual transition for the child, the Mother or a person authorised by the Mother (“authorised person”) is to bring the child to meet the Father at the access venue.

>> (iv)       The Father shall decide on the access venue from the options stated at paragraph 3(b)(ii) above and inform the Mother at least 48 hours beforehand where to bring C to meet him at the access venue.

>> (v)       The Mother/authorised person may accompany C and the Father until C has warmed up to the Father and gradually handover C to the Father within the first 10 - 20 minutes of meeting the Father.

>> (vi)       Both parties are to assure C that the Father and C will meet again with the Mother/authorised person at the end of the access session.

>> (vii)       The Father shall inform the Mother/authorised person where to meet him and C later at the end of access for the Mother/authorised person to bring C home.

> (c)     In the event either the Father or C is unavailable on the designated day or time of access, unless it is due to medical reasons or unforeseeable circumstances, the other party is to be informed at least 48 hours in advance so that an alternative day or time may be arranged.

> (d)     If parties are unable to reach an agreement on an alternative day or time 24 hours before the stipulated day or time of access, the following make-up arrangements shall apply:

>> (i)       In the case of weekday access, the Father shall have access to C on the Wednesday evening of the affected week from 5.00 p.m. to 7.00 p.m. or if it is due to medical reasons, the next available Wednesday, from 5.00 p.m. to 7.00 p.m.

>> (ii)       In the case of weekend access, the Father shall have access to C on the Sunday morning of the affected week from 10 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. or if it is due to medical reasons, the next available Sunday, from 10.00 a.m. to 12.30 p.m.

> (e)     Where access is cancelled due to medical reasons, the affected party shall provide a medical certificate setting out the ailment and the days the party is unfit.

> (f)     In the event that C is unwell, the Mother is to inform the Father accordingly of C’s condition, when she will bring C to see the doctor, the name of the clinic, the doctor’s diagnosis, prescribed treatment and medication administered.

> (g)     Parties shall attend mandatory counselling at the Centre for Family Harmony @ Commonwealth. A counselling report shall be furnished to the Court at the end of the counselling sessions.

> (h)     A review of the counselling orders and access orders shall be fixed in 4 months’ time.

4       The Father appeals against my decision, save for the orders that both parties shall have joint custody of C with care and control to the Mother and the order granting the Father unsupervised access to C.

5       I now set out the reasons as to why I did not find it in the best interests of C for the Father to be granted liberal, overnight or overseas access at the time of the hearing. Given the complex and inextricable nature of the facts, I will address the reasons for the orders on access generally, without limiting it to the parts appealed against, for better understanding.

## Facts

### The parties

6       The Father is an Indian National and currently working in Singapore on an Employment Pass. The Mother is a Singapore Citizen.

7       Parties were married in Singapore on 23 August 2017 after a brief period of courtship of about 7 months. After the marriage, parties stayed briefly with the Father at his rental accommodation before moving to the Mother’s apartment at Leedon Residence (“Leedon Apartment”).

8       Their only daughter, C, was born on xx March 2018. At the time of the hearing, she was 2 years and 7 months old.

9       Parties had an explosive and tumultuous relationship throughout the marriage. There were cross allegations of family violence, excessive smoking and alcohol abuse made by the Mother against the Father, and by the Father of the Mother as being deceitful and potentially suffering from Borderline Personality Disorder, resulting in her violent outbursts and emotional instability, leading to the separation of parties and the breakdown in their relationship. It is against this backdrop that the facts are set.

### Background to the dispute

10     Shortly after C was born, the Father moved out of the Leedon Apartment on 8 April 2018 due to differences between parties. About three months thereafter, on 23 June 2018, the Father returned to live in the Leedon Apartment together with C and the Mother, in the hope of reconciliation. However, things did not work out between parties and the Father eventually moved out of the Leedon Apartment again on 4 August 2018. The Mother subsequently moved out of the Leedon Apartment with C to live with her parents in their home at Chestnut Drive. Parties have been living separately ever since.

11     Pursuant to the separation, the Father wrote to the Mother on 31 December 2018 through his solicitors for unsupervised and unrestricted access to C. The Mother disagreed and replied through her former solicitors that, as she had concerns over C’s safety, she would only allow the Father supervised and controlled access to C until she was assured that the Father would act and conduct himself in the best interest of C.

12     On 2 April 2019, the Father filed an application essentially for joint custody of C, with care and control to the Mother and liberal access to the Father on condition that, _inter alia_, the Mother sought psychiatric evaluation and complied with the recommended medical treatment. In the alternative, the Father requested for sole custody, care and control of the infant with access to the Mother.

13     The Mother disagreed with the Father’s application and sought instead for a dismissal of the Father’s application on the basis that it was unsafe for C to have access to the Father, given his propensity for family violence, poor anger management and alcohol abuse. In the alternative, if the Court was minded to grant the Father access, only supervised access should be granted.

14     In order to appreciate the nature of parties’ relationship, it is pertinent at this juncture to set out the procedural history of the case.

### Procedural History

#### Orders for Interim Access dated 16 May 2019

15     At the second Status Conference on 16 May 2019, orders were made by consent for the Father to have interim access to C as follows:

> (a)     Supervised Visitation at DSSA once a week for a duration of 2 hours for a maximum of 8 sessions.

> (b)     Weekend access every Saturday from 10 a.m. – 12 p.m. in a public place. If the DSSA access takes place on a weekend, the access will be changed to every Wednesday 6 p.m. – 8 p.m. Access is to be supervised by the Mother.

> (c)     In default of an agreed place of access by parties, the morning access shall take place at the nearest playground to the Mother’s home and the evening access shall take place at the MacDonald’s at Hillion Mall.

> (d)     The above orders are without prejudice to the parties’ position taken in FC/OSG 56/2019.

> (e)     A report to be submitted to the Court after the 6th Supervised Visitation session and a review to be convened.

> (f)     The Father is to notify the Mother via WhatsApp if he was to be delayed by informing the Mother half an hour in advance.

16     In addition, on 29 August 2019, parties were ordered pursuant to mediation to undergo a second tranche of 8 supervised visitation sessions and to attend the Children-In-Between Programme at DSSA.

#### The Mother’s application for a Personal Protection Order

17     On 27 June 2019, the Mother filed an application for a Personal Protection Order (“PPO”) on behalf of C and herself against the Father. She was granted an Expedited Order. The application for a PPO on behalf of C was based primarily on a single incident that had occurred during one of the access sessions, when C had fallen from a slide and hurt her head.

18     The Mother subsequently withdrew her application for a PPO on 3 February 2020 pursuant to an undertaking provided by the Father.[^3] The undertaking of the Father was given without any admission to liability. The application for a PPO on behalf of C was withdrawn unconditionally.

#### Access arrangements pursuant to the 16 May 2019 orders

19     Pursuant to the interim access orders made on 16 May 2019, the Father complained that the Mother would make attempts to frustrate his access to C. She would cancel access, on the pretext of being ill, without providing the Father any make-up access to C or deny him access if she disagreed with a proposed venue as being too far or inconvenient. She would also use safety issues to restrict the Father’s access to C. As a result, access failed to take place whenever parties could not agree on a venue or an alternative day for access.[^4]

20     In view of the above, on 23 October 2019, I ordered parties to attend co-parenting counselling at the DSSA to work out their communication issues in relation to the access arrangements. This was to help parties resolve conflict, reduce acrimony and assist them to better communicate with each other at arranging access.

21     On 1 November 2019, the Father filed the Originating Summons (Amendment No.1). I have set out in detail the prayers sought at \[1\] above. Essentially, the Father no longer sought sole custody, care and control of C.

22     At the case conference on 27 December 2019, the Father sought further directions on interim access pursuant to the 16 May 2019 orders as parties still could not reach an agreement on a venue for access. Parties were thus directed, _inter alia_, as follows:

> (a)     Weekday access to take place every Tuesday, from 6 - 8 p.m., either at Kidzland or Cafe Benedicto

> (b)     In the event that either party is unable to attend, parties are to arrange another weekday access in the same week itself.

23     In addition, I ordered parties to undergo a third tranche of supervised visitation for 6 sessions and to continue with co-parenting counselling on 31 January 2020, in view of the missed access sessions outside of DSSA and temporary suspension of earlier counselling orders by DSSA pending the resolution of the Mother’s PPO application.

#### Father’s application for interim physical access to the child

24     On 7 April 2020, in view of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the circuit breaker measures, the Mother unilaterally ceased all physical access arrangements and offered the Father virtual access to C instead. By this time, all supervised visitation programmes at DSSA had similarly been suspended.

25     Left with no better alternative, the Father accepted the arrangement and virtual access took place between both the Father and C on 16 April 2020 and 18 April 2020 via remote video-conferencing through Zoom for about 10 minutes, given the short attention span of C and technical difficulties encountered by the Father.[^5]

26     Dissatisfied with the arrangement, on 12 May 2020, the Father filed an application in FC/SUM 12XX/2020 for the earlier physical access arrangements to C to resume on Tuesdays 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. and Saturdays 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. at the Botanic Gardens, Dairy Farm Nature Park or Chestnut Nature Park, or such other venue as the Court may decide. The Father also requested for make-up access for the missed access since 7 April 2020.

27     The Mother objected to the Father’s application on the basis that her approach was in line with Regulation 4(3)(d) COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020 (“Covid Regulations”).[^6] She further averred that C was able to handle video-access as she was already engaging very well in Home Based Learning with her school on a daily basis, and proposed for the Father and C to start with thrice weekly virtual access. Contrary to the Father’s evidence, the Mother disagreed that access only took place for 10 minutes and stated that the Father’s inability and inflexibility to work through teething problems, when faced with technical difficulties, led to the breakdown in the virtual access sessions.[^7]

28     After hearing parties on 8 June 2020 and 15 June 2020, I made the following orders[^8] (“Interim Access Orders”) pending the hearing of the main case in FC/OSG 56/2019:

> (a)     The Father is to have supervised access to the child of the marriage as follows:

>> (i)       On Tuesday evenings, from 5.00 p.m. to 7.00 p.m. at the Singapore Botanical Gardens, Petir Park or the Garden Room of the Mother's parents' place.

>> (ii)       In the event that parties are unable to reach a consensus on the venue, access is to take place on alternate weeks at Petir Park and the Singapore Botanical Gardens.

>> (iii)       If there is wet weather and parties are unable to proceed for access at any of the outdoor venues, access is to take place at the Father’s home. In the alternative, parties may arrange makeup access on another weekday for a duration of two hours.

>> (iv)       On Sundays, from 10.00 a.m. to 1.00 p.m. Access is to take place at the Father’s home. The Father may bring the child out to eat or play with the supervision of the Mother.

>> (v)       On non-DSSA weekends, in addition to the access on Sunday, the Father shall have access on Saturday to the child for three hours, at a time and venue agreed upon by parties. In the event parties are unable to reach an agreement, access is to take place at a public venue from 10.00 a.m. to 1.00 p.m.

>> (vi)       Alternatively, on non-DSSA weekends, if the Father wishes to bring the child out on an excursion, he shall have only one weekend access to the child either on a Saturday or Sunday for a duration of 6 hours from 9.30 a.m. to 3.30 p.m., subject to the child's schedule. The Father is to inform the Mother of the excursion venue beforehand.

> (b)     Access is to be supervised by the Mother or any other person whom she authorises.

> (c)     For the supervised access sessions at the Father's home, the Mother is entitled to bring her helper along. In the event, the helper is unavailable, she may bring along another person subject to the consent of the Plaintiff.

> (d)     Parties are free to change any of the above orders by written agreement.

> (e)     For avoidance of doubt, the previous order made on 31 January 2020 for the third tranche of supervised access at DSSA is to stand.

29     The above orders were made with the following in mind:

> (a)     At the time of the hearing, circumstances had changed such that parties were no longer bound by the earlier Circuit Breaker measures, which ended on 1 June 2020, in view of Singapore entering Phase One. Nonetheless, to minimise the risk of transmission, it was prudent to minimise parties’ and C’s exposure to public areas. I note further that the Father had prepared a room for C in his home, with the necessary furnishings and toys, which was conducive for access.[^9]

> (b)     Although the Mother had withdrawn her application for a PPO based on an undertaking by the Father, allegations of violence committed by the Father against the Mother remains.[^10] As this was an application for the continuation of earlier supervised access arrangements, I took into account the Mother’s request for the presence of a third-party during access at the Father’s home.

> (c)     Given the missed access time between the Father and C, it was crucial to assist the Father and C to maintain and develop the bond which had been gradually built over two tranches of supervised visitation at DSSA, especially after the cessation of the supervised visitation sessions at the DSSA pursuant to the pandemic. However, instead of tallying the number of days of make-up access with missed access, I increased the duration of weekly supervised access. The aim was to ensure overall regularity and predictability for C in her access to the Father.

30     These interim orders are relevant as they provide the context for parties’ submissions in the hearing of the main OSG application.

#### Compliance with other DSSA Orders (apart from the Supervised Visitation Programme)

31     At the hearing on 30 November 2021, both parties confirmed that they had completed the Children-In-Between Programme.

32     With regards to the mandatory co-parenting counselling order, DSSA reported that parties had attended the initial intake session. The Mother subsequently attended one counselling session while the Father attended a telephone counselling session. Parties subsequently voluntarily agreed to participate in Schema Therapy at the invitation of their assigned DSSA counsellor (“the counsellor”) to work on the management of their emotions. It was indicated to parties that the Schema Therapy sessions would not be used in Court and was meant to assist the counsellor with her Schema Therapy training.

33     The professional relationship between the counsellor and the Father subsequently broke down when the Mother filed an affidavit exhibiting a private email exchange between her and the counsellor, where the counsellor appeared to empathise with the Mother on her safety concerns in relation to the Father having access to C.[^11]

34     The Father eventually informed the counsellor at the counselling session on 20 June 2020 that he wanted to stop all counselling sessions as he was of the view that the counsellor had formed an alliance with the Mother. It is not disputed that at the material time, the Father had been under the impression that the Schema Therapy sessions were purely on a voluntary basis and outside the scope of mandatory counselling.[^12]

35     In view of the above, the Father’s counselling case was closed while the Mother continued to attend mandatory counselling. The Mother was subsequently referred by DSSA to Care Corner Project Start for counselling on her safety concerns.

## The Applicable Legal Principles

36     Section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act (Cap 122) states that:

> " Where in any proceedings before any court, the custody or upbringing of an infant or administration of any property belonging to or held in trust for an infant or the application of the income thereof is in question, the court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration and save insofar as such welfare otherwise requires, the father of an infant shall not be deemed to have any right superior to that of the mother in respect of such custody, administration or application nor shall the mother be deemed to have any claim superior to that of the father."

37     It is clear that the overriding and paramount principle is the welfare of the child. In _Wong Phila Mae v Shaw Harold_ \[1991\] SLR 93, the Court of Appeal made the following observations in relation to the ‘welfare principle’ when custody is fought for:

> “Obviously the court has to take all relevant factors into account in considering the welfare of the children… We agree with counsel for the appellant that some of the relevant factors are these:

>> (i)    the conduct of the parties;

>> (ii)   the wishes of the parents and the wishes of the child where he or she is of an age to be able to express an independent opinion;

>> (iii)   a young child would be best look after by its mother;

>> (iv)   which party can offer better security and stability; and,

>> (v)    that siblings should not be separated.

> We also agree that the fact that one parent is more capable of providing material comfort for a child does not necessarily render that parent a better parent and thus entitles him or her to the custody of the child. In the final analysis it is an exercise in weighing the relevant factors which often conflicts.”

38     With regards to whether a parent's access to a child ought to be supervised, it was held in _APE v APF_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 17</span> that:

> “…unsupervised access should be awarded, unless the following exceptional circumstances are present:

>> (a)    there are serious welfare concerns regarding the noncustodial parent such as violence or inappropriate parenting if the child were left unattended with the noncustodial parent;

>> (b)    on an examination of the state of the relationship between the non-custodial parent and the child before the commencement of the divorce proceedings and after the commencement of the divorce proceedings, it is found that the child has been estranged from the noncustodial parent such that the parental-child relationship is in need of serious repair (for instance, if the child is fearful in meeting the non-custodial parent); or

>> (c)    factors exist such that it is difficult for unsupervised access to be effectively implemented (eg, where the relationship between both parents is so acrimonious that the custodial parent frustrates the effectiveness of unsupervised access orders and unsupervised access is not possible without detriment to the child)."

39     The Court in the above case went further to state at \[33\] that even if the child should view the non-custodial parent in a fearful or negative light, the Courts should nevertheless seek to repair the parent-child relationship where the circumstances permit.

40     With regards to whether there are serious welfare concerns in relation to the non-custodial parent, it was noted by the Court in _BKJ v BKK_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGDC 261</span> at \[23\]-\[25\] that there must be a reasonable basis for the allegations of abuse or danger, and a mere unsubstantiated fear or suspicion is insufficient to justify supervised access. In that case, the Court found that while the Defendant Mother did not think much of the Plaintiff Father’s parenting skills, there was no evidence that the Plaintiff’s parenting skills were so very bad that the child would be in danger of them.

## The Parties’ Cases

41     The Mother did not have any objections to the Father’s prayer for joint custody of C and with care and control to the mother. The main dispute between parties related to the Father’s application for liberal and unsupervised access as well as overseas access to C.

42     With respect to liberal and unsupervised access, the Father specifically sought the following orders[^13] in his affidavits and submissions:

> (a)     Unsupervised access on Tuesdays after school from 4 p.m. – 7 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 a.m. – 6 p.m.

> (b)     Progressive overnight access as follows:

>> (i)       For the first 3 months, once a month from Fridays after school from 4 p.m. to Saturdays 6 p.m.

>> (ii)       For the next 3 months, twice a month on alternate weekends from Fridays after school from 4 p.m. to Saturdays 6 p.m.

>> (iii)       Thereafter, weekly overnight access from Fridays after school from 4 p.m. to Saturdays at 6 p.m.

> In the event school ends earlier than 4 p.m., the Father’s access shall commence after school.

> (c)     Alternate Public Holiday access from 10 a.m. – 6 p.m.

> (d)     School Holidays to be shared equally with liberty for either parent to take C for overseas holiday provided written notification is given to the other party of the travel itinerary including flight details, accommodation and contact details at least once a month prior to departure, with effect from the June holidays in 2021.

> (e)     The Father shall pick C up from and drop her off at the Mother’s residence for each access.

> (f)     In the event that C is unwell and unable to go for access, the Mother shall produce a medical certificate and there shall be make up access within the same week, with liberty for the Father to visit C at the Mother’s residence to visit her for not more than half an hour

> (g)     In the event that C is unwell, the Mother shall inform the Father. If C is taken to the doctor, the Mother shall inform the Father of all the details of such a visit, including the reason for the visit the diagnosis, treatment and medication administered. The Father is also at liberty to accompany C to the doctor.

43     The Mother on the other hand sought the following orders[^14]:

> (a)     The Father’s access to C shall continue to be supervised at DSSA twice a week on Tuesdays 5 p.m. – 7 p.m. and on Saturdays 10 a.m. – 12 p.m.

> (b)     Only if DSSA supervised access sessions are not possible, then the following supervised access arrangements shall apply:-

>> (i)       On Tuesday evenings, from 5 p.m. – 7 p.m., at the Garden Room;

>> (ii)       On Saturdays from 10 a.m. – 12 p.m. at the Petir Park. In the event of wet weather, such access shall take place at the Garden Room;

>> (iii)       All access is to be supervised by the Mother and/or another person whom the Mother authorizes. There should be no requirement of needing the Mother’s consent for the Father to bring along another person for these access sessions;

>> (iv)       Direct communication between the Parties are to be kept to the minimum, with communication restricted only to changes to the access arrangements due to exigencies. Parties are to refrain from using abusive and aggressive language in their communication with each other;

>> (v)       There shall be no provision for make-up access.

>> (vi)       The Father shall not bring the child overseas except with the Mother’s consent in writing. In the event that the Mother consents to it, the Father is to provide the necessary details for such overseas trip one month in advance, including but not limited to the flight details, where the child will be staying and the contact details which the child can be reached; and

>> (vii)       The Mother is at liberty to bring the child overseas provided that the Mother provides the Father with the necessary details for such overseas trip one month in advance, including but not limited to the flight details, where the child will be staying and the contact details which the child can be reached.

### The Father’s Position

44     In total, the Father filed 7 affidavits, including an affidavit from a family friend who was aware of the conflict between parties, and tendered video footages of various access sessions taken from the security camera installed in his home. The Father alleges that since the Interim Access Orders were made, the Mother continues to interfere with and frustrate his access to C, thus hindering C from developing a meaningful relationship with him.

45     In support of his application for unsupervised access, the Father categorically states in his affidavit that the Mother has persistently blocked and prevented the Father from bonding and developing his relationship with C. She has made it difficult for the Father to exercise access by:

> (a)     Complaining about the distance to access venues, restricting and/or rejecting the proposed venues for access, persistently being late for access and at times leaving early, cancelling access at the last minute on the account of purportedly being unwell.

> (b)     Deliberately refusing to communicate with the Father on access arrangements and provide him with any information to arrange and prepare for access.

> (c)     Falsely accusing the Father of alcohol abuse, excessive smoking, engaging in alienating behaviour and lacking the ability to care for C during access.

46     In addition, the Orders that the Mother sought aimed to curtail the Father’s access to C and were a regression from the current Interim Access Orders in terms of scope and duration.

### The Mother’s Position

47     In total, the Mother filed 7 affidavits, including a joint affidavit from her parents and an affidavit from A, contesting the Father’s application for unsupervised access on the basis that the Father is ill-equipped to care for C for the following reasons:

> (a)     he is aggressive and has serious anger management issues;

> (b)     he is a severe alcoholic and smoker;

> (c)     he is oblivious to C’s safety concerns;

> (d)     he is not attuned to C’s physical and psychological needs; and

> (e)     he is estranged from C.

48     In addition, the Mother objected to overseas access on the basis that the Father is not a Singaporean Citizen and is only here on an employment pass. As his residence in Singapore is not permanent, he is able to leave Singapore without ever returning and is therefore at flight risk with C if overseas access is granted.[^15]

## The Court’s Findings

49     As the Father’s appeal concerns mainly the subsequent orders I had made pursuant to the general order for unsupervised access, I will touch briefly on the reasons for my order for unsupervised access.

#### Court’s Findings on the Allegations Made by the Mother against the Father

50     From the affidavits filed by the Mother and her witness A, who would accompany the Mother to the Father’s place during the interim access sessions at the Father’s place, I did not find any incidences of violence or aggression against the child. Most of the alleged incidents raised by the Mother pertained to interactions between the Father and the Mother.

51     With regards to the Mother’s allegation of the Father as an excessive smoker and alcoholic, I find that there is no evidence to show that he had smoked in the presence of the child during access. There is also no evidence in support of the Father being inebriated or intoxicated during access, apart from a bare allegation by the Mother and A that they smelt alcohol on the Father’s breath. On the contrary, from the video footage of the alleged incident, the Father did not appear to be inebriated or intoxicated during the access session. In addition, the child appeared to be actively playing and being engaged in activities with the Father. I note further that there were no allegations of abuse or misconduct stemming from the alleged intoxication or inebriation.

52     With regards to the Mother’s allegation of the Father being oblivious to C’s safety, I dismissed the allegation as I find from the video footages tendered that the Father would proactively ask the child not to sit at the edge of the sofa, on the edge of the bed or too near the television. He has come a long way from the initial incident on the slide and has over time become more aware and attuned to the safety of the child.

53     I note further that the Father also proactively takes an interest in C’s wellbeing. Despite the acrimony between parties, after being informed by the Mother that C is on an organic and vegetarian diet, the Father made efforts to consult a dietitian and to ascertain from the Mother whether the food or fruits he intended to feed C during access were suitable for her.[^16] The Father would also take the effort to bring toys and books for C’s enjoyment during access sessions outdoors[^17] and at the DSSA. He even had a room set aside in his own home specially for C to play in, which is referred to as the “the princess room”.[^18] When access had to be cancelled as C fell ill, the Father would proactively enquire with the Mother on C’s wellbeing and request for updates on her progress or contact C’s clinic directly to enquire on her condition.[^19] I did not find any evidence from the interactions between Father and child, that the Father was estranged from C.

54     In the case of _BKJ v BKK_, the Court had found that although the mother did not think much of the father’s parenting skills, there is no evidence that the father’s parenting skills in that case were so very bad that the child would be in danger of them. I find that to be true in the present case as well and granted the Father unsupervised access.

55     I wish to add that apart from a bare allegation, I did not find any evidence to support the Mother’s concern of the Father being at flight risk with the child.

#### Observations on C’s Behaviour

56     I now come to the reasons why I did not grant the Father liberal unsupervised access, overnight access and overseas access. In addition, I had specified the access duration, venue and manner of transition for C.

57     In making the orders, I had taken into consideration the behaviour of C observed from the following sources of evidence:

> (a)     C’s behaviour in school, as noted from her Parent and Teacher Communication Book; and

> (b)     C’s behaviour during access as noted from the video footages tendered by the Father.

58     In her affidavit dated 28 September 2020, the Mother exhibited pages from C’s Parent and Teacher Communication Book (“Communication Book”) raising behaviours exhibited by C in school from 23 June 2020 to 3 August 2020 and observed by her teacher, S.[^20]

59     For ease of reference, I have summarised the observations in the table below:

60     In addition, the Mother had also exhibited an email dated 31 August 2020 from C’s teacher and a letter dated 28 August 2020 from one Dr P, a private child psychiatrist.[^21]

61     In the email dated 31 August 2020 from S to the Mother, S summarised the observations made in the Communication Book and noted that with longer stay at home periods, C’s behaviour has eased and had been slowly returning to normal. She further noted that on 26 August 2020, C informed S that “nobody loves her, only her daddy loves her”.

62     In her letter dated 28 August 2020, Dr P states that the behaviour exhibited by C are triggered by external stressors and that the behaviours exhibited are unlikely to be from a developmental or internal medicine issue. Dr P further recommended that C be referred to a child psychiatrist for assessment for custodial issues.

63     Counsel for the Father submitted that the behaviour exhibited by C on 23 June 2020 took place in the morning of the first Tuesday access that the Father was to have to C pursuant to the Interim Access Orders. Furthermore, given that the Orders made were for supervised access, it could not be a case of the Father alienating the child from the Mother. On the contrary, there were possible concerns instead of the Mother instilling unwarranted fears into C.[^22] There were moments in the Father’s interaction with C when C would inform the Father that “daddy is bad” and “mummy doesn’t like daddy”.[^23]

64     With regards to the external stressors referred to in Dr P’s email, counsel for the Father further submitted that external stressors influencing C is not limited to the Court’s orders or the Father’s alleged influence and could be anything, including the Mother’s alleged influence over the child.[^24]

65     While I find that there is no evidence in support of either the Mother or Father influencing the child, it is clear and evident to me that C was suffering from distress arising from the issues between the Father and the Mother. Here was a child who was in need of parental comfort and the reassurances of both parents, and who needed the security of knowing that she would not be abandoned by either.

66     I note further from the video recordings of the supervised access that took place at the Father’s residence that the child was not inhibited in her interactions with either the Father or the Mother. In fact, she appeared to be at ease playing together with the Father in “the princess room” or watching television with him holding her on the bed in his bedroom. From time to time, C would wander out of either “the princess room” or the Father’s bedroom and look for the Mother. At times, she would pull the Mother into the room to be with her and the Father. Her need for both parents is clear to me.

67     At this juncture, I wish to commend both the Father and the Mother. Despite the acrimony between parties, they have made efforts to put aside their own personal reservations and co-operate in order to give effect to the supervised orders. It is clear to me that both parties do have C’s interest at heart. I wish to impress upon the parties that even if the legal relationship between parties may end, the parental relationship with C will continue to deepen and grow along with C, as C grows. It is the co-parenting relationship that needs to improve and grow for the benefit of C. Admittedly, this is not without its challenges.

#### Unsupervised access to take place gradually

68     Unsupervised access has to take place gradually. I note the child has been used to having the presence of the Mother during access over the last one and a half years. This is supported by the Court's observations from the videos furnished by the Father that the child would seek out the Mother from time to time during the supervised access sessions to assure herself of the Mother's presence. Given the young and tender age of the child whose sole caregiver has been the Mother, it is important that unsupervised access begins gradually for the child to get used to access with the Father alone in the absence of the Mother. The aim is to help the child to transition from supervised access to unsupervised access in a manner that would mitigate her separation anxiety or stress.

69     To achieve this, I saw it necessary therefore for unsupervised access to take place first in places that are familiar to the child and over a shorter duration, until the child has grown accustomed to having access alone with the Father in the absence of the Mother. It is important that the child is not given the impression that by being with one parent, she is at risk of losing the other. Both play an equally important role to the child. It is also for this reason that I did not make any orders for overnight access and overseas access at the time of the hearing, pending the review of the counselling and access orders which was to take place in four months’ time from the date of the Order.

70     It is in this spirit that I made the orders as stated at \[3\] above. In making the orders, I bore in mind the following facts:

> (a)     On more than one occasion, interim access had failed to take place previously as parties could not agree on a particular venue.[^25] As such, in order to facilitate co-operation between parties and minimise conflict, I ordered access to take place at specified venues familiar to the child.

> (b)     From the text messages exchanged between parties, their conversations in relation to the child, for the purposes of access, tend to be filled with hurtful and accusatory words against each other, both of which are not constructive or effective for co-parenting.[^26]

> (c)     Parties have not completed their co-parenting counselling. In order to help parties acquire and develop the relevant skills to co-parent effectively, there is a need for parties to undergo counselling in relation to nurturing parenting skills, positive communication skills, stress-management skills and co-parenting skills. This is also in line with DSSA’s recommendations. As such, I ordered for parties to attend mandatory counselling at DSSA in the hope that this would aid them in their co-parenting for the benefit of C.

> (d)     There have been moments during interim access when C was caught in between parties’ dispute.[^27] As such, I found it necessary to provide some form of guidance in my orders for the handing over of C by the Mother to the Father for unsupervised access in order to minimise her separation anxiety and to provide some form of predictability for C during the unsupervised access sessions.

> (e)     The Mother had on certain occasions cancelled access without providing the Father with any make-up access to the child. I note further that make-up access did not take place when parties could not reach an agreement on the day or venue.[^28] It was therefore necessary to specify in my orders the manner in which make-up access would take place in the event parties were unable to reach an agreement on the same.

71     Given the existing issues between parties, as highlighted above, the orders are meant to assist the parties and C to transition from supervised to unsupervised access, with a review fixed for four months later after parties had completed their mandatory counselling at DSSA.

72     With regard to the venues for unsupervised access, I now explain the reasons why I had ordered unsupervised access to take place on weekdays at the Garden Room of the Mother’s home and on weekends at nearby malls, which the Mother had suggested in her proposals to the Father.

73     Pertinently, these were venues that were familiar to C and were located near C’s home[^29], therefore minimising the travelling time and the chances of C being late for access – an issue which the Father had consistently raised against the Mother. I did not see it necessary to confine access to just one venue so as to allow for some variety in the environment and the activities the Father could engage C in. With regard to the Garden Room, which is a separate annex on the grounds of the Mother’s parents’ home, the Father had objected for access to take place here in view of the numerous pieces of furniture, making it unconducive and potentially dangerous for C. I note however that steps were subsequently taken by the Mother to remove the furniture in the room. I note further that access actually took place once on 26 September 2020 at the Garden Room when C was ill[^30]. As the Garden Room was located next to a garden, the Father and C were not limited to playing just in the Garden Room itself. I therefore find the Garden Room a suitable venue for the Father to have access to C on weekdays after her return from school in the evenings.

74     Counsel for the Father had asked for the Court’s rationale for not ordering specified access to take place at the Father’s house. I had explained the reason for this at the hearing on 30 November 2020.[^31] It was to mitigate any potential stress or separation anxiety that C might have during unsupervised access alone with the Father at the Father’s house, without the presence of the Mother.

75     In relation to the Father’s proposed access arrangements during school holidays, I did not make any orders as C is still attending pre-school, which does not have a fixed school holiday period as primary and secondary school going children do. I also did not make any orders in relation to access on public holidays, pending the review of the unsupervised access orders.

76     The Father had also requested for liberty to accompany C to the doctor when she is ill. I did not see it necessary to provide for this in my orders since parties have joint custody of C.

## Conclusion

77     At the end of the hearing, parties agreed to file written submissions on costs and for the Court to deliver its decision via Registrar’s Directions thereafter.

78     The Father submitted for the Mother to pay $15,000 in costs as the Mother’s conduct had created further acrimony between the parties. Such a cost order would send a signal to the Mother to be more co-operative in parties’ co-parenting endeavours.

79     The Mother on the other hand submitted for no orders as to costs on the basis that to do so may unnecessarily aggravate the acrimony and bitterness between parties. This outcome would be highly undesirable since parties must continue to co-operate with each other to co-parent C. In support of her submissions, the Mother relied on the case of _JBB v JBA_ \[2015\] SGHCF 61 (_“JBB v JBA”_).

80     After reading parties’ submissions, in light of the facts of the present case, I agree with the Mother that an order for cost would further aggravate matters between parties. Although the decision in _JBB v JBA_ was made in the context of matrimonial proceedings, the observation made by the Court in that case is relevant to the present case. I therefore ordered parties to bear their own costs.
