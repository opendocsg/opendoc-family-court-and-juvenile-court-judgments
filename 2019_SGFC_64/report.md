Family law – Relocation

17 June 2019

### District Judge Chia Wee Kiat:

## Background facts

1       The Plaintiff shall be referred to as the “Mother” and the Defendant shall be referred to as the “Father”. In the main, this is an application filed by the Mother under FC/SUM 237/2019 (“SUM 237”) to be granted “leave of court to leave the jurisdiction of Singapore permanently with the children of the marriage by a date to be determined by the court and in any event no later than July 2019 to settle on a permanent basis in Danbury or its surroundings, in Chelmsford, United Kingdom (“UK”)”. The circumstances leading up to this application are briefly as follows.

2       The parties are Portuguese citizens and both hold Singapore Permanent Residency. The Mother is 38 years old while the Father is 40 years old. They have been resident in Singapore since 2008 and became Singapore Permanent Residents (“PRs”) in 2011.[^1] They have two children to the marriage, a boy aged 6 and a girl who turns 11 in June. In this judgment, I shall refer to them as Xavier and Yvette (not their real names) respectively. The children are Portuguese citizens and Singapore PRs. They were born in Singapore and have lived here all their lives. Yvette is in Year 6 whilst Xavier is in Year 1 in an international school in Singapore.

3       The Father has a successful career in an architecture firm where he has worked for over 10 years and has risen to the position of Executive Principal. The Mother is also an architect by profession.

4       The Mother met the Father whilst they were both studying at the university in Lisbon, Portugal. They were married on 22 December 2007. In 2008 they moved to Singapore. She is currently a Director of Project Management of a subsidiary of a multinational company.

5       On 16 February 2015, the Mother filed for divorce in the Family Court. The divorce was initially contested with the Father filing a Defence and Counterclaim on 6 March 2015. Shortly thereafter, the parties came to a resolution on the divorce and an Interim Judgment was granted on 18 June 2015 on an uncontested basis. On 8 July 2015, the parties entered into a global settlement on the ancillary matters (hereinafter referred to as the “consent order”). Final Judgment was granted on 29 September 2015. The divorce proceedings were thus concluded on an amicable note.

6       Under the consent order, the parties agreed to have joint custody of the children with care and control to the Mother and reasonable access to the Father, for a minimum of one day and one night every weekend per week, such access to be agreed around both the parents’ and the children’s respective schedules. Paragraph 3(c) of the consent order, which provides for the possible relocation of either party, states as follows:

In the event of a possible relocation by either party, the Plaintiff and the Defendant agree that parties will mutually discuss and come to a mutual consensus and/or agreement of the same taking the children’s welfare as paramount consideration.

7       Both parties have moved on in their lives and formed new relationships. The Mother has a partner \[“A”\] who is British. According to the Mother, A has lived with the Mother and the children since October 2017 and shares “a beautiful and strong bond” with the children.[^2] A has two daughters aged 14 years and 10 years respectively who are residing in Chelmsford, UK. A’s daughters have met Xavier and Yvette on several occasions over the years during the occasional school holidays and summer breaks. Xavier and Yvette have developed a close bond with A’s daughters. The Mother and A have decided to relocate to the UK. The Mother intends to marry A in Spring-Summer 2020 and hopes for a new beginning for the children.[^3]

8       The Father has a partner \[“B”\] who owns her own media company. According to the Father, the children share a close relationship with B who thinks of them as her own children. Since 1 January 2019, the Father has moved in to live with B in her three-room condominium on account of his firm intention to establish a life with B on a more permanent basis. B has two daughters who share a close bond with Xavier and Yvette.

9       The Mother filed SUM 237 on 18 January 2019. Prior to the filing of the application, the Mother had asked the Father in August 2018 if he was agreeable to the children relocating to the UK with her. Unfortunately, the parties were unable to come to a consensus on this matter. In light of the Father’s objection to the relocation, the Mother proceeded to take out the present application.

10     The application was heard before me on 22 May 2019. In her supporting affidavit, the Mother had alluded to the family’s apprehensions about Xavier having to serve national service (“NS”) in Singapore. According to the Mother, the family had intended to leave Singapore before Xavier turns 11 years old before he gets called up for NS.[^4] The Father disputes this assertion. According to the Father, Xavier will not be exempted from NS just because he leaves Singapore before the age of 11. Moreover, the Father is proud to see Xavier undergo NS when that time comes.[^5]

11     I reserved my decision upon confirmation from counsel for the Mother that she would seek the necessary clarification with regard to Xavier’s NS requirements. Although this is only one of the matters to be taken into consideration, it is important for the issue to be clarified so that the correct fact is properly presented to the court. Moreover, important decisions affecting children should not be based on erroneous assumptions, especially on a matter as serious as relocation.

12     Counsel for the Father has no objection for the clarification to be provided to the court by way of correspondence. Parties are also agreeable for the decision of the court to be thereafter rendered in writing. This is permissible under Rule 670(2) of the Family Justice Rules which provides as follows:

In any proceedings referred to in paragraph (1), the Court may, with the consent of all the parties to those proceedings, give a judgment, or make an order, a decision or a determination, on any matter in those proceedings without the attendance of any party to those proceedings.

13     The proceedings referred to in paragraph (1) of Rule 670 include proceedings in a Family Court and hence apply to the present case. The parties have also indicated that they would prefer to submit on costs in writing after a decision has been rendered.

14     Counsel for the Mother has since reverted to the court _vide_ letter dated 30 May 2019 on the issue of Xavier’s NS requirements. Counsel for the Father has also written to the court _vide_ letter 4 June 2019 on the same issue. I shall refer to the contents of these letters in the later part of this decision.

15     As noted earlier, this application concerns the permanent relocation of two young children of a marriage that has irretrievably broken down. Relocation of children is one of the most challenging decisions that the court is called upon to decide in family disputes. As the Court of Appeal observed in _BNS v BNT_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGCA 23</span> (at \[2\]) (“_BNS (CA)”_):

Cases of this nature are never easy to decide. As Mostyn J observed pithily in the English High Court decision of _Re AR (A Child: Relocation)_ \[2010\] EWHC 1346 (Fam) at \[4\], “\[t\]hey involve a binary decision – either the child stays or he goes” and hence, whichever way the court decides, the decision is bound to cause considerable pain and anguish to one of the parties. The relocating parent will be aggrieved by a refusal of the application as that ostensibly ties him or her down, against his or her wishes, to an environment which he or she has little affinity towards. On the other hand, it is the left-behind parent who suffers if the relocation application is allowed because that naturally curtails not just the quantity but also the quality of that parent’s contact with the child (or children).

16     These observations of Debbie Ong JC (as she then was) in _TAA v TAB_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHCF 1</span> (at \[7\]) (“_TAA_”) also bear reiterating:

The legal principle guiding the courts in relocation applications in Singapore is similar to that in many countries: the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration. This principle itself is simple enough in concept but very challenging in its application to each unique case. The main difficulty rests in the tension between upholding the primary carer or custodial parent’s freedom to relocate and the child’s interest in maintaining a relationship with both parents within the same country.

17     I have considered very carefully the parties’ submissions and weighed all factors relevant to the inquiry. In the final analysis, I find that the scales do not tip in favour of relocation at this time and accordingly, the Mother’s application should be refused. I should state, at the outset, that my decision is not intended in any way to deny the Mother’s wish to start a new life. On the contrary, I find it heartening that both parties have moved on and found new partners of their own. However, a decision on relocation is based ultimately on the welfare of the children. On the facts before me, I am simply unable to find that the Mother’s wish to relocate is compatible with the best interests of the children. I set out below the reasons for my decision.

## The Mother’s application

18     The Mother submits that it is in the children’s best interests to be relocated with her to the UK in July 2019.[^6] These are the key points from the Mother’s written submissions:

(a)     Firstly, the parties had never considered Singapore as their permanent home, and that relocation to another country was always a long-term intention.[^7]

(b)     Secondly, the Mother has planned and informed the Father of the relocation since August 2018. The Mother has spent extensive time and effort to plan for the relocation to the UK, supported by her extensive research done regarding the family’s accommodation, children’s school and co-curricular activities.[^8] The children are now both confirmed and enrolled in the UK schools.[^9]

(c)     Thirdly, it would be in the children’s utmost interests to relocate in July 2019, for the reason that the children will be commencing their formal Primary and Secondary education in the UK in September 2019 at the start of the Academic Year 2019/2020, and when the children finish their school term in Singapore. The extra month would provide some buffer for the children to acclimatize to the environment and also enable the Father to visit the children if he wants to.[^10] Relocation will be increasingly difficult as the children grow older as they would have deeper ties in Singapore, which will make it more difficult for them to adjust and fit in with the new environment.[^11] This is a one-off relocation and not an interim move, as the Mother’s intent is to have the children attend senior school and university in the UK.[^12]

(d)     Fourthly, the Mother has always been the only one involved in the evaluation and selection of the children’s schools in Singapore. The Mother spent extensive time and effort in the last two years, planning for the children’s smooth and practical relocation to the UK.[^13] The children’s education in the UK is cheaper than the children’s current education in Singapore.[^14] The children’s first language is English and they are not likely to have difficulties adjusting to the language spoken in the UK. As the children have always been in the international school in Singapore, it is not likely that there will be issues adjusting to schooling in the UK.[^15]

(e)     Fifthly, the children have never integrated with the local community in any way, nor have they assumed the culture of the country.[^16] The children are aware that they are Portuguese citizens and their roots that the Mother and their grandparents share with them. All of the children’s friends have been expatriates and hence they are likely to find a closer connection with the European culture than Singapore’s culture.[^17]

(f)     Sixthly, the Mother has secured a location for the family to live at Danbury, UK in a spacious 5-bedroom house. The location is well connected to London for the Father’s and their relatives’ visits, and the children’s easy access to their schools from the home.[^18]

(g)     Seventhly, the children will have an extensive support network in the UK, closer in proximity than in Singapore. The children will have extended family in Essex in the UK where A’s mother, sister and daughters live.[^19] The Mother plans to bring the children to visit Portugal more frequently as it is only a 3-hour flight away from the UK. The grandparents and relatives are also highly likely to visit and live with the Mother. As citizens of the European Union (“EU”) countries, they are able to live in the UK with the Mother for extended periods of time than they are able to in Singapore.[^20]

(h)     Eighthly, the Mother intends to bring the helper \[“C”\] who has been consistently present in the children’s lives. This will ensure continuity and familiarity in the children’s lives. [^21]

(i)     Ninthly, the Mother has a good employment history and the company is supportive of her relocation to the UK with the children. She was told that she would maintain her position in the same company in the UK and be given flexible work arrangements to work from home in the UK if they relocate.[^22] This would be ideal for the children as they will be able to benefit from the Mother staying at home for them to adjust to the UK.[^23]

(j)     Finally, there will not be a loss of relationship between the children and the Father.[^24] The Mother has been the primary care giver of the children since their birth.[^25] In contrast, the Father has been uninvolved with the children since their birth because he had always prioritised his work above family and the children.[^26] Even if the relocation application is denied, the Father is unable to provide for the daily care arrangements for the children.[^27] Although the Father may see less of the children if they move to the UK, they could still maintain a positive and loving relationship through a combination of physical and remote access.[^28] The Mother proposes that there is liberal access and there is an increase in access time available for the Father.[^29] The Father travels frequently for work purposes and it takes him to Europe. As an Executive Principal, he exercises substantial control over his work and projects involved, work hours and flights. Also, the Father is Portuguese and returns to visit Portugal. He will be able to visit the UK from Portugal.[^30] Additionally, the children are used to using technology to contact the Father. They have been using their iPads and phones to contact their Father. This form of communication is not new to them and would merely continue in the UK should the relocation be granted.[^31] Further, the Mother has always supported the Father’s access to the children.[^32]

## The Father’s objections

19     The Father’s objections, as set out in his written submissions, are based on the following grounds:[^33]

(a)     The Mother has not given any good reason for her desire to relocate; and

(b)     In any event, the Mother has not established that relocation to the UK is in the children’s best interests.

20     With respect to the first ground, the Father submits as follows:

(a)     The Mother is not a trailing expatriate wife attempting to relocate back home – she is asking to relocate to the UK, whereas her country of origin is Portugal;[^34]

(b)     The Mother is a capable employee herself and is not a trailing homemaker. She is not relocating because she lost her job in Singapore;[^35]

(c)     The Mother’s affidavits are not clear as to why she wants to relocate with the children. She has not explicitly stated any particular reason for her relocation;[^36]

(d)     There is nothing in the Mother’s evidence to suggest that there has been a “transference of the Mother’s insecurity and negative feelings onto the child” unless she relocates;[^37]

(e)     The Mother’s omission to state any reason for her desire to relocate is fatal to her case;[^38]

(f)     If the Mother’s wish to relocate is to be with her new partner, this is not a reasonable wish to relocate.[^39] Firstly, the Mother is not married to A or even engaged to him. Secondly, even if the Mother is engaged to A, the question remains as to why she has to relocate with A to the UK. No explanation has been given as to why A is moving to the UK.[^40] The lack of details pertaining to A’s intended relocation to the UK means that the Mother has failed to discharge her burden of proof.[^41] It suggests that the move to the UK is by choice, not by compulsion;[^42]

(g)     If the Mother is relocating purely because she desires that the children study in the UK, this is also not a reasonable wish.[^43] The Mother has cited no strong ground for why the children ought to be educated overseas.[^44] She has not explained why the children will do better in the UK than in Singapore.[^45] The children are in fact thriving in Singapore.[^46] The children have been educated in Singapore for the entirety of their lives and have benefited from the high quality of education in Singapore. Singapore’s education system has been consistently ranked highly in the world, in contrast to the UK. The children have performed very well academically and the Mother has not shown that the UK schools provide further benefit that the children’s school in Singapore currently does not offer;[^47] and

(h)     As the Mother has not shown cogent reasons for wanting to relocate, her intention to relocate is a matter of her personal preference and not made in the best interests of the children.[^48]

21     With respect to the second ground, the Father submits as follows:

(a)     Neither party disputes that the other is unable to discharge their roles as parents. [^49] By and large, parties are both able to provide for the children’s physical and emotional needs. This is evidenced by the rather balanced lifestyles that the children enjoy outside of school, during the time spent with both parents;[^50]

(b)     The Mother has not provided any evidence of actually having secured employment in the UK even though she claims that her current company is supportive of her decision to relocate. The Mother has no experience in the UK property market and there is a considerable amount of uncertainty in the UK due to Brexit. The mother cannot say with any certainty that her circumstances in the UK are stable at all;[^51]

(c)     The Mother does not have any support network in the UK. The Mother’s only sibling, her sister, currently lives in Singapore (in the same condominium as the Mother) with her family. The Mother’s mother had passed away in 2017, and the Mother’s father has been spending extended periods of time in Singapore since her mother passed away. The Mother claims to have a support network from Portugal in the form of her extended family. However, she has been silent as to who the members of her “extended family” are and who would be able to assist in supporting her. Even if the “extended family” reside in Portugal, they are still a 3-hour flight away from the UK;[^52] and

(d)     The Mother has not married A. Should her relationship with A unfortunately come to an end, the Mother does not have a support network of her own, to provide her assistance in caring for the children’s physical and emotional needs. In contrast, the Father has a strong support network in Singapore who will be able to assist the parties in the event of emergencies.[^53]

22     Aside from the above, the Father highlights that the children currently benefit from being part of two loving family units in Singapore.[^54] Whilst the Father has not sought to deny the Mother’s contributions in terms of her caregiving, the Father asserts that the Mother has gone to great lengths in her affidavit to cast aspersions on the Father’s caregiving and involvement in the children’s lives.[^55] The Father emphasises that the children share a strong relationship with him.[^56]

23     According to the Father, the only feasible form of recurring access between the children and the Father is remote access in the event that relocation is granted. The Mother proposes for the Father to have daily Facetime/Skype/phone access during weekdays from 7.15 – 7.30 am (UK time). The Father points out that this translates to around 2.15 – 2.30 pm in Singapore, which is right in the middle of a working day.[^57] The quality of access between the children and the Father will be severely compromised.[^58] The Mother’s proposal for the Father to have a total of five weeks per year to exercise physical access is also unfeasible. In order to exercise his physical access, the Father would have to take around 30 to 35 days of leave each year, which is more than the 25 days of leave he is entitled to.[^59] Relocation will leave the Father with severely curtailed access to the children, which will erode the strength of the relationship and bonds that the children and the Father share presently.[^60]

24     Furthermore, the Father has no confidence that the Mother will facilitate any form of access even with a court order. He cites two examples where the Mother had allegedly breached the consent order.[^61] The Father alleges that the Mother has not been generous with access[^62] and has exhibited a propensity of disrupting the Father’s access.[^63]

25     The Father highlights that he has consistently taken the position that relocation was only a last resort if both parties could no longer be gainfully employed in Singapore and had no choice but seek employment elsewhere to support the family. The plan was always for the family to relocate together and this plan has not changed even though the marriage has broken down and parties are living separate lives.[^64]

26     The Father points out that the children have resided in Singapore since their birth and this is the only home they have known. The children have firmly embraced the local culture and have vastly assimilated through cultural experiences. The children relish in Asian cuisines and have actively taken part in traditional customs such as dressing up for Chinese New Year celebrations.[^65] The children have no ties at all whatsoever to the UK[^66]. The UK is certain of leaving the EU and when Brexit occurs, it is likely that neither the Mother nor the children will have a right of abode in the UK as they are not UK citizens.[^67] If the Mother loses her right of abode in the UK, there is no guarantee that she will be able to return to Singapore and the risk applies similarly to the children.[^68] Relocation to the UK would create very significant disruption to the children’s lives, for no apparent benefit to them.[^69]

## Principles on Relocation

27     The principles guiding the courts on relocation applications are summarised in _UFZ v UFY_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHCF 8</span> (at \[7\] & \[8\]) (“_UFZ_”) as follows:

7.    The applicable legal principles in relocation applications have been set out by the Court of Appeal in _BNS v BNT_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 973</span> (“_BNS_”). As with all proceedings where the custody or upbringing of a child is in issue, “**_the welfare of the child is paramount and this principle ought to override any other consideration_**” \[emphasis in original\] (at \[19\]). This principle is also the statutory direction in s 125 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) and s 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act (Cap 122, 1985 Rev Ed).

8.    The inquiry of what is in the welfare of the child involves a consideration of a multitude of factors. Relocation applications involve one parent exercising his or her authority to relocate the child to another jurisdiction. Two important factors that will come into play will unsurprisingly be: (i) the reasonable wishes of the primary caregiver; and (ii) the child’s loss of relationship with the ‘left-behind’ parent (_BNS_ at \[28\]). These factors, amongst others, are pertinent in helping the court assess what the best interests of the child are. This assessment is “**_an intensely fact-centric exercise_**” \[emphasis in original\] (_BNS_ at \[28\]) and will remain a very difficult one in all relocation cases. I emphasise that every relocation case is unique, because every family’s circumstances and dynamics are unique. Thus, while past cases are useful in elucidating the various factors the court will consider, each case will be decided on its own facts.

28     In _ULV v UKZ_ \[2018\] SGJCF 19 (at \[24\]), it was also observed as follows:

There is no presumption in favour of allowing relocation where the primary caregiver’s desire to relocate is reasonable. Rather, the relocating parent’s reasonable wish to relocate is only relevant to the extent that there would be a transference of the relocating parent’s insecurity and negative feelings onto the child, since it is the child’s welfare that lies at the heart of the inquiry, and not the interests of the relocating parent (_BNS v BNT_ at \[20\]; see also _TAA v TAB_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 2 SLR 879</span> (“_TAA v TAB_”) at \[17\]). There is no pre-fixed precedence or hierarchy amongst the various factors to be weighed in the overarching inquiry into the child’s welfare. Where the factors stand in relation to one another depends, finally, on a consideration of all the facts of the case (_BNS v BNT_ at \[22\]).

29     As noted above, the inquiry as to what is in the welfare of the children involves an intensive assessment of the facts. It is to the facts that I shall now turn to.

## Mother’s reasons for relocation

30     The Father has asserted that it is not clear why the Mother wants to relocate with the children. Since the grounds of the application are stated in the Mother’s affidavit dated 18 January 2019 filed with the summons (“supporting affidavit”), I shall begin by examining the supporting affidavit.

31     In her supporting affidavit, the Mother states that she had asked the Father in August 2018 if he was agreeable to the children relocating to the UK with her. She explained to the Father that parties were in agreement that Singapore would always be temporary and as such presented to him that both she and A were considering to relocate. The Mother asked the Father whether he had plans to relocate in the near future and the Father indicated that he had no set plans. According to the Mother, the Father objected to the relocation on the basis of him wanting to be close to the children regardless of how positive and beneficial the UK would be for their upbringing.[^70] In the ensuing part of the supporting affidavit, the Mother went on to explain why relocation to the UK is in the children’s best interests.[^71] The Mother also discloses that she and A have since secured the tenancy of a 4-bedroom detached house in Danbury, Chelmsford.[^72]

32     It is clear from the above that the Mother’s wish to relocate is a decision taken with her partner. The question that arises is whether the wish is reasonable and compatible with the interests of the children.

33     As noted in _TAA_, in many cases where relocation was permitted, the circumstances under which the applications were made were rather dire. An example cited was the case of _AZB v AYZ_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 627</span> (“_AZB_”). In _AZB_, the High Court was of the view that the wife’s decision to relocate back to the US was “perfectly understandable and eminently reasonable”.[^73] Amongst other things, the court noted that the wife, a 49-year-old American, felt alienated and isolated in Singapore which compelled her to be heavily reliant on her Malaysian husband despite the breakdown in their relationship.[^74] The family had been living in Singapore since January 2005, having lived in Malaysia and San Francisco before that. The wealthy husband had adamantly refused to support her application to become a PR ostensibly because she would not be able to drive a cheaper Malaysian registered car in Singapore if she became a PR.[^75] The husband was not only keenly aware of the wife’s vulnerability and insecurities, but had sought to exploit it to his advantage.[^76] The problem was exacerbated by the fact that she was married to an extremely rich and allegedly influential man whilst she had no family members or close friends in Singapore to act as a support group for her.[^77] The court found that the wife’s decision to relocate back to Illinois would enable her to get the support she needed to move on from the messy breakdown of her marriage.[^78]

34     The present case does not fall within the category of such cases. The Mother has resided in Singapore for over a decade and is a Singapore PR. She is a successful career woman in her own right[^79] and clearly valued by her employer, as is evident by the employer’s support of her decision to relocate to the UK and willingness to accommodate her request to work from home.[^80] She lives the life of an expatriate[^81], having previously worked in Macau, China for four years from January 2004 to January 2008 before relocating to Singapore.[^82] Although her marriage to the Father has ended, the parties have been able to maintain a positive co-parenting relationship post-divorce. It is clear from her affidavits that the Mother is fully aware of the benefits of providing good access and communications to the Father and she has supported and encouraged this since the divorce in 2015.[^83] According to the Mother, she would always make it a point to extend an invitation to the Father during birthday parties and family events so that the latter is included and the children are not affected.[^84]

35     Although the Mother is in a relationship with A, she acknowledges that A will never replace the Father as the children’s father:

Whilst \[A\] will never replace the Defendant as their father he is no doubt a very loved male figure that supports me on principles and the children’s mindfulness, at our home for the past 1.5 years. The Defendant needs to accept that he has moved on and so did I. [^85]

36     In her relocation plan, the Mother states further as follows:

I will do my utmost to ensure that the Defendant continues to enjoy and maintain a close and meaningful relationship with the children despite the long distance as I understand a father’s love can never be replaced and that \[Xavier\] especially will require a father figure in his life.[^86]

37     From the accounts given by the Father and the Mother, the children are happy and well-adjusted. They enjoy going to school and the times they share with each parent[^87], including going on holidays to Portugal and the UK.[^88] During access times, the children have fun and games, play-time and overseas trips with the Father.[^89] The ability of both parents to move beyond past hurts and build a new post-divorce relationship that is nurturing and loving for the children is commendable indeed.

38     Both the Mother and the Father have found new partners. The children get along with the adults and their children. In caregiving, the Mother is assisted by the helper C who has been with her for four years. The children have grown fond of C and see her as part of the family.[^90] The Mother’s sister, along with her brother-in-law and only niece, are living in the same condominium as the Mother. They have been residing in Singapore since 2012.[^91] Since the demise of her mother in March 2017, the father has visited the Mother for an extended period of time.[^92]

39     By all account, the Mother is doing well. She is a capable woman who has manged to find a balance between her career and her children’s needs.[^93] Her main unhappiness, in her own words, are as follows:

I note that the Defendant himself has plans to relocate and to be “closer to home” in the future albeit no definite strategy or plan has been shared. It is unlikely our timings and job opportunities will ever align. Nevertheless, I strongly feel that it is shortsighted and unfair on the part of the Defendant to object to our relocation and expect that the children, my partner and I put our lives on hold and disregard the benefits for the children and our household.[^94]

40     It is understandable that the Mother, who is divorced from the Father and has found a new partner to whom she intends to get married to, should be free to follow her heart and live the life that she desires. However, “\[t\]he law expects parents to put the interests of the children before their own” (_TAA_ at \[17\], cited by _BNS (CA)_ at \[20\] and \[29\] and _UFZ_ at \[18\]) and this “often require the parents to make personal sacrifices for their children” (_UFZ_ at \[18\]). For these reasons, the Mother’s wish to relocate would have to be tampered by the expectation of the law that the relocation must be compatible with the interests of the children.

41     The present case is unlike those cases where it was necessary for the primary caregiver to relocate. In the present case, the Mother has the real option of staying put and thriving in Singapore. She has been staying in Singapore since 2008. She is used to the life of an expatriate and has carved out a successful career of her own.[^95] She is not dependent on the Father for her maintenance and is connected to her family, friends and colleagues. She is a Singapore PR which means she can choose to stay on and continue to work in Singapore for as long as she wants. Her children are PRs, have lived in Singapore all their lives and are very well taken care off .[^96] Explaining why she and the Father had taken up PR status in Singapore for themselves and the children, she said:

We also wanted to benefit the mandatory CPF contribution which we saw as an additional savings plan. It also allowed us to consider non-expatriates employment salary options. Finally, we saw PR status as a safeguard against disruption of the children’s schooling when they reached school-going age.[^97]

42     The Mother has a healthy and loving relationship with A,[^98] who according to the Mother has been a good father figure to the children since October 2017.[^99] The Mother did not explain why she and A have to relocate to the UK. Although A is a British citizen, he has been residing in Singapore, since October 2017 at least. The Mother has not provided any information regarding A’s occupation and employment history. There is no suggestion that A is compelled by work or personal reasons to relocate to his home country. The parties are not relocating to A’s home, but to a property in Danbury that she and A have rented.[^100]

43     In the circumstances, it would appear that the Mother’s wish to relocate to the UK is a matter of choice. There is no real necessity to relocate as such. However, this does not _ipso facto_ mean that the wish to relocate is unreasonable. Afterall, who is to say that the Mother should not have a second chance at happiness? She is divorced and deserves to leave the past behind and follow her heart wherever it may take her. Moreover, this is not a case where the move abroad is done in bad faith (for example, to end access) which “would be a very strong factor to refuse the application” (_Re C (an infant)_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] SGCA 50</span> at \[22\]). In fact, the possibility of a relocation was contemplated in the consent order. Furthermore, the parties and the children are not Singapore citizens. So it is not entirely unexpected for a relocation to be considered.

44     On the other hand, it is undeniable that the move at this point would affect the children as they would be deprived of the presence of one parent. The Mother has a real enough option of staying in Singapore where the children can continue to benefit from the love and guidance of both parents. How then should the reasonableness of the Mother’s wish be evaluated in a situation such as this? In my view, where a relocation is a matter of choice, the reasonableness of the wish of the primary caregiver would have to be evaluated against the impact of the relocation on the welfare of the children. Where the relocation is compatible with the interests of the children, one would be hard put to say that the wish is unreasonable. On the other hand, if the relocation is incompatible with the interests of the children, it would not be difficult to see why the wish is unreasonable as the relocation would be at the expense of the welfare of the children.

## Uprooting the children

45     The relocation to the UK involves the uprooting of two young children from Singapore where they have lived all their lives. They will have to fit into a new environment and a different education system whilst missing out on the weekly dinners, stayovers and activities with the Father.

46     The Mother’s plan is to enrol Yvette in The Sandon School (“Sandon”) and Xavier in Danbury Park Community Primary School (“Danbury Park CPS”).[^101] Her research reveals that Sandon is a popular mixed comprehensive school with an excellent reputation in the local area and within the community.[^102] The property that she has secured with A at Danbury is within the school catchment area and the school term for the academic year 2019/2020 is expected to commence in September 2019.[^103] Likewise, Danbury Park CPS is a popular school within the community and some of the school’s achievements includes a grade of “Outstanding” from the 2018 Ofsted report.[^104] Both schools are conveniently only 3.7 km away from one another, and a mere 3-minute drive. There are also direct buses that connect both schools.[^105] It is the Mother’s desire that the children may one day be admitted to the top universities in the UK such as the University of Oxford, University of Cambridge, Imperial College of London and London School of Economics and Political Science.[^106]

47     The Father points out that while the Mother has gone to great lengths to highlight the achievements of Sandon and Danbury Park CPS, she has not shown why relocation to the UK would better serve the children’s educational needs.[^107] The Father highlights that the children are doing very well in the _status quo[^108]_ and I note, in this regard, that the Mother has confirmed that the children are “performing well in Singapore”. In fact, that is the reason why the Mother is confident that the children are “well-equipped with the necessary foundation to thrive in the UK’s education system come July 2019”.[^109] The children have received very positive feedback from their teachers. It is evident from the teachers’ testimonials that the children are eager to learn and contribute in classes. The children have clearly impressed the teachers with their attitude, enthusiasm and achievements.[^110] The teachers have found them to be warm, helpful and caring, which must be heartening to know for any parent.

48     As the children are doing well, the question that naturally arises is why is there a need to upset the _status quo_. It is important to answer this question squarely as the change of the _status quo_ involves many trade-offs, no less of which is the loss of relationship with the Father which will affect the wellbeing of the children.

49     In HCF/DCA 71/2015 (referred to in _UFZ_ at \[12\]-\[13\]), Debbie Ong J affirmed the Family Court’s decision to allow the mother with care and control of the children to relocate with them to her home country, Australia. The court took into account a number of factors, including the fact that the education system in Australia would better support the special needs of one of the children. As Australian citizens, the mother and children also had citizen privileges in Australia.

50     Whilst each case must be decided on its own facts (_UFZ_ at \[17\]), HCF/DCA 71/2015 serves to illustrate the point that one of the factors the court will take into consideration in a relocation application is whether the children will derive any benefit from a foreign education system. In a case such as the present where the Mother has placed such great emphasis on the children’s educational needs in support of her wish to relocate, the answer to the question assumes even greater significance.

51     Yet, it has not been shown why relocation to the UK would better serve the children’s educational needs. Whilst the overall cost of education for the children in the UK is expected to be lower than the cost education for the children in Singapore,[^111] there is no suggestion that the parties are unable to continue to fund the children’s education in Singapore or that that cost is even a reason for the relocation.

52     The children are currently doing the International Baccalaureate (“IB”) Programme in school. By her own account, the Mother has been very particular in the selection of the children’s school in Singapore from the start[^112] and the school they have found for the children is “excellent”.[^113] In her supporting affidavit (at \[45\]), the Mother describes the benefits of the school (anonymised in this judgment as “\[S\]”) as follows:

45.    Enrolling the children in an international school was the ideal choice for us. What more, \[S\] offers the following benefits:

a)    Teachers are well-trained and experienced in dealing with international students;

b)    There is no dominant culture or nationality group. The student bodies in \[S\] comprise of pupils from all corners of the globe, exposing the students to a culturally diverse environment that is similar to university campuses. This way, students spontaneously learn about different cultures and traditions giving them a more holistic approach to people. It also develops in them the ability to work well in a diverse socio-cultural context. We found this to be benefit for the children as we envisioned that we not be in Singapore for the children’s tertiary and university education;

c)    A diverse and extensive language programme;

d)    A balanced education through its arts, sports and academic-based teaching methods. Singapore is well-known for having one of the toughest public educations systems in the world. This was a concern for us and our children whom are trying to adjust to a new culture, curriculum and ultra-competitive academic environment;

e)    Excellent learning opportunities for access to universities worldwide; and

f)    Flexibility of existing the school and re-joining another international educational programme. \[S\] offer the International Baccalaureate (IB) curriculum, a curriculum that has similarities with the National Education system in England.

53     It is not disputed that the children are getting an excellent and holistic education in Singapore. It is also not disputed that the children have flourished and thrived. The Mother expressed it well in these words:

I verily believe that having been expatriate children is an amazing and unique exposure to different cultures for the children. No doubt \[Xavier\] and \[Yvette\] will benefit from the experience they had to-date, it is a great foundation to have ... [^114]

54     At this point, the astute observation of Ormrod LJ in _Chamberlain v de la Mare_ (1983) 4 FLR 434 (cited in _Re C (an infant)_ at \[22\]) bears reiterating:

The question therefore in each case is, is the proposed move a reasonable one from the point of view of the adults involved? If the answer is yes, then leave should only be refused if it is clearly shown beyond any doubt that the interests of the children and the interests of the custodial parent are incompatible. One might postulate a situation where a boy or girl is well settled in a boarding school, or something of that kind, and it could be said to be very disadvantages to upset the situation and move the child into a very different educational system. I merely take this as an example. Short of something like that, the court in principle should not interfere with the reasonable decision of the custodial parent.

55     There is always a risk involved when children are uprooted from a country they are familiar with and placed into a different society and education system. They may adapt and flourish or they may not. However, the risk can be mitigated and the chances of success enhanced if they continue to enjoy the love, care and support of both parents. As noted in _BNS v BNT_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 187</span> (“_BNS (HC)_”) (at \[21\]), citing _BG v BF_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 3 SLR(R) 233</span>), “a child will feel more secure if both his parents continue to be involved in his life”. It was further noted in _BNS (HC)_ (at \[22\], citing _HKMB v LKL_ \[2007\] HKCU 291) that it was “important for the child’s “emotional and psychological stability” to maintain “regular and meaningful contacts” with both parents and that the child would experience a “sense of loss” if his relationship with the parent who is left behind was adversely affected”.

56     In my assessment, it would be disadvantageous to upset the current situation when there is no real advantage to be gained where the children’s education is concerned. The change would also result in the loss of emotional and psychological support from the Father at a time when it is most needed. Whilst the loss of an opportunity to have a meaningful relationship with the parent who is left behind is a separate factor for consideration in a relocation application, it is important to bear in mind that the loss would also affect the capacity and resilience of the children to adapt to a new environment. The Mother’s optimism in the children’s ability to thrive in the UK education system, whilst encouraging, should be tampered by these considerations.

57     Moreover, as highlighted by the Father, the Mother was unsuccessful in securing a place for Yvette in Sandon. Yvette was instead offered a place in William de Ferrers School which is located 11 km away from the Mother’s place of residence. It would mean travelling for a distance much further than what the Mother had originally anticipated. The Mother has appealed to Sandon to reconsider Yvette’s application and the appeal hearing will take place at the end of June 2019. The Mother has applied for places in school for the son and the posting results will only be known in mid-June 2019.[^115]

## Loss of children’s relationship with the Father

58     The Father is concerned that the Mother will not facilitate any form of access in the event that a relocation is granted. This application has unfortunately re-opened some old wounds. The Mother has indicated that it was never her intention to revisit these old wounds as she had hoped that parties would have moved on with their respective lives. She had even instructed her solicitors to avoid rehashing certain unpleasant past incidents of the parties and of the marriage. It has, after all, been more than four years since the Writ was filed and she had hoped that the Father would likewise do the same.[^116] She was however compelled to respond to the allegations of the Father to set the record straight.[^117] The Father, not unexpectedly, has his side of the story to tell.

59     Divorce is one of life’s most stressful events. The upheaval that a divorce brings to a family can be traumatic particularly where there are young children involved. The impact of the parents’ divorce can be acutely felt by the children in each developmental stage as they cope with the new realities of a separated family. The parents have to manage their emotional, mental and financial wellbeing as they re-organise their lives post-divorce. They have to overcome their emotional baggage to communicate with each other and make joint decisions for the welling of the child.

60     Despite all the challenges that would typically confound a family under stress of divorce, the parties in this case have been able to put aside their differences and come to an amicable resolution of the divorce and the ancillary matters. Despite the stress of marital breakdown, the parties have been able to shield the children from the harmful effects of the divorce and have cooperated successfully to ensure that the children continue to benefit from the love, care and guidance of both parents.[^118] They have both recognised the need to avoid involving the children in this matter as far as possible.[^119]

61     The children have greatly benefited from the enlightened approach of their parents, as can be seen from the progress they have made in their developments, the many heart-warming photographs shown to the court and the testimonials of their teachers. Therefore, I do not think that there can be any justification in the suggestion that the Mother would impede access in the event of the relocation being granted. Issues with access and misgivings are bound to arise from time to time but they should not be unnecessarily amplified. The Mother’s efforts in facilitating access since the divorce ought to be duly acknowledged and recognised.

62     However, it is undeniable that the quality of access between the children and the Father will be severely compromised because of the long distance between the UK and Singapore and the difference in the time zones. Whilst the Father is not the primary caregiver of the children, he has participated actively in the children’s lives. For example, on account of wanting to remain close to the children even after he had moved out of the matrimonial home, the Father rented an apartment near the Mother’s condominium sometime around October 2014. He would walk to the Mother’s condominium to see the children every morning and give them a kiss, before seeing them off to school. He would try to get back early from work to play with both of them in the playground adjacent to the Mother’s condominium.[^120]

63     The Father has played an active role in the children’s enrichment activities such has taking them to Capoeira classes, a Brazilian martial arts form, every Sunday at their request.[^121] He has taken the children out on many activities such as visits to the Science Centre, Kidszania, the Singapore Zoo, Jurong Bird Park, River Safari and the ArtScience Museum. In 2014, he brought Yvette for a football game between Brazil and Japan at the National Stadium. In 2017, he brought the children to the Formula 1 practice race and the Cold Play music concert and in 2018 to the Chainsmokers and Clean Bandit music concerts. He brought the children frequently to the cinema and for mountain climbing, ice skating and cycling sessions.[^122] All these despite the fact that he has a busy career.

64     He has actively been encouraging the children to pursue their interests in areas outside of academics so that they may be exposed to the cultural diversities of Singapore. Yvette for example, is actively involved in volunteering with her music teacher from school. She has joined a programme where students develop activities and performances for the elderly to develop friendships outside of school. [^123]

65     The Father has also been involved in Yvette’s progress at school. For example, Yvette was assigned to do a group project in March 2019 and she chose the theme “Construction”. The Father was heartened as this showed her admiration for the Father. The Father was also very pleased that he could readily offer his help. The project group dedicated a section to the Father’s firm and the Father was interviewed by them _via_ Skype. Yvette also accompanied the Father to his offices on a Friday afternoon where he showed her around and introduced her to one of his colleagues who is one of the owners of the firm. After the project, the Father received an email from the teacher thanking him for his time for the interview.[^124]

66     The children have their own room filled with their own toys, books and games at the condominium where the Father resides with B. According to the Father,[^125]

They enjoy coming over to our place very much and would look forward to spending time with us as a family. Currently, the children come over at least every weekend during my access, as well as on special occasions such as Public Holidays and my birthday. Whenever the children stayed over at our place, \[B\] would frequently read them books before they went to bed.

67     The current access arrangements that the Father has with the children are as follows:

(a)     Every morning (provided that he was not travelling), the Father would wait for the children at their school, and see them briefly before they go for their classes.

(b)     Every night before 8 pm, the Father would Facetime the children to ask them about their day and see them before they go to sleep.

(c)     During the weekend, the Father spends 7pm on Saturdays to 7 pm on Sundays to bond with the children. They have meals together and go for frequent outings and bond through cultural activities. The Sunday activities include riding bicycles and sometimes scooters at East Coast Park, having picnics at the Botanic Gardens, Gardens by the Bay and East Coast Park, and accompanying the children to their friends’ birthday parties.[^126]

68     The Mother has suggested that the Father only started to play a more active role in the children’s lives since she broached the topic of relocation to him in August 2018.[^127] However, having considered all the circumstances, I do not think that this is a fair criticism to make, in the same way that I do not think that it was fair for the Father to suggest that the Mother would impede access. The allegations and cross-allegations are most unfortunate. I find that both parents are genuinely interested in the welfare of the children and have each done their best to help maintain a sense of normalcy in the lives of the children post-divorce. If they would only focus on the kinder aspects of each other, there would be perhaps be less room for misgivings.

69     The Mother points out that she too has also been bringing the children to one-off activities all these years and she considers these to be normal parent-child activities in the spirit of co-parenting.[^128] Just as the Father has exhibited at TAB 27 of his affidavit in reply photographs taken during outings with the Father,[^129] she too has “hundreds or thousands of photographs and selfies with the children over the years” and exhibited some of them at TAB 41 of her 2nd affidavit.[^130] She states as follows:[^131]

For the avoidance of doubt, a summary of the Defendant’s access with the children since September 2014, and allowing the school summer holidays/Christmas holidays etc. when the latter takes the children on holidays which I estimate to be on average approximately 15 days per annum and another 10 days for additional access for play, is as follows:

Plaintiff : 286

Defendant : 79

This is 72% to 28 %

Even when there were occasions that I had given the Defendant additional access days, it does not sway to equal parenting time. During these times, again, it is only play. The Defendant does not go through the children’s homework and/or academics with them.

70     There is no doubt in my mind that the Mother as the primary caregiver of the children has played a very significant role in all aspects of the children’s lives and wellbeing, and the role is in no way diminished by the role that the Father has played. However, the roles of both parents are complementary and it would serve no purpose to pit one parent against the other. What is important to note is that even by the Mother’s account, the Father has been actively involved in the children’s lives, granted to a lesser extent compared to the Mother. There can be no doubt that the children share a close relationship with the Father. In my assessment, there is a real likelihood that the bond that currently exists between the children and the Father will be undermined if the children are relocated to the UK. In this regard, the observations of Judith Prakash J in _BNS (HC)_ (at \[44\]) bear restating:

Granting the mother’s relocation application would likely mean that the father’s role in the children’s lives will be greatly reduced. The reduction of the father’s role would be detrimental to the children’s development. It is in the children’s best interests for them to continue to have a meaningful relationship with both their mother and father. Given that the children are young, they would benefit from more regular interaction and physical contact with both parents. Given the fact that the father is an active and involved father who is genuinely concerned about the children’s welfare, the reduction of his role in the children’s lives would be all the more distressing and should be avoided.

71     These observations, though made in the context of the factual matrix in _BNS (HC)_, are just as relevant to the present case. Although the Mother has suggested that the children are used to using technology such as iPads and phones to contact the Father, such form of communication can never replace the closeness that can only be provided by the activities that the children currently get to do with the Father every weekend. As also noted in _BNS (HC)_ (at \[35(c)\],

The facts of the children’s young ages and the difference in time zones between Canada and Singapore will make it difficult for their father to sustain the closeness of his present relationship with them. With younger children, closeness is promoted by physical contact and frequent interaction in routine activities. Telephone and internet access are frequently unsatisfactory due to technical difficulties and generally permit only one type of interaction: conversation. Normal family life consists of much more than conversations between parent and child – there are joint activities, routines, projects, discipline and learning from the examples set by the parents in all sorts of situations.

72     The children are young and the relocation would severely disrupt the regular physical contact with the Father. The Facetime contact suggested by the Mother is not the most ideal given the time zones difference between the UK and Singapore.

## Other considerations

#### Culture and roots

73     The Mother contends that the current expatriate environment is not one that fosters any deep fusion into everyday life lived by Singaporeans. What the children see is a community that is ever-changing and unable to imprint any sort of permanence on them. While the expatriate lifestyle has taught them to have a high appreciation and respect to people from all countries and religions, they do not develop a sense of belonging and cultural identity. The Mother believes that a sense of belonging, commitment and attachment to a culture is important as it plays a strong role in one’s self-esteem and identity and hence it is important for the children to “transition closer” to their roots, their family and traditions.[^132]

74     However, the Father points out as follows:

Finally, the Mother’s claim that the children will integrate better into European culture is so broad and sweeping as to be ridiculous. Europe is a huge continent, and there is no such thing as “European” culture. Each European country has its own culture – indeed, even within countries there are usually many distinct and disparate cultures. There is thus no equivalence between Portuguese culture and “European culture”. Furthermore, we point out again that both children were born in Singapore and have lived in Singapore and have lived in Singapore all their lives. Even though they are technically Portuguese citizens, they have not lived in Portugal. They are thus more socialised into Singapore society than Portuguese society.[^133]

75     The Father points out that the children embrace the local culture and have vastly assimilated through various cultural experiences. For example, the children currently learn Mandarin and are able to converse and write in simple Mandarin. They are also familiar with Asian food such as Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Chinse and Cantonese cuisines, and even relish them more than traditional Portuguese or Brazilian food. During Chinses New Year celebrations every year, the children too love dressing up in traditional costumes and dance the Lion and Dragon dance.[^134] Moving them to an unknown and unfamiliar environment is not in any way facilitative of establishing any “roots”. The children have lived in Singapore for the entirety of their lives and their current support network comprises their friends and teachers here, as well as the Father and the Mother. The children will have to start over and rebuild their lives again from scratch if the Mother is allowed to relocate with them to the UK. This will severely disrupt the stability that the children currently enjoy.[^135]

76     As noted above, the Mother is concerned that the perceived lack of belonging and cultural identity would affect the children’s self-esteem and identity. However, such fear is unwarranted. The objective evidence shows that the children are not lacking in self-esteem and identity. On the contrary, they are confident, happy and thriving as is evident from all that has been presented to the court. As the children have lived in Singapore for the entirety of their lives, there is no reason to believe that they have not integrated well in the local community and culture. The children are aware that they are Portuguese citizens and the roots that the parents and their grandparents share with them.[^136] They get to travel to Portugal about once a year on the average during the holidays for about two weeks[^137] and they like listening to stories, and hear about their family history and culture from their grandparents.[^138] They also get see the Mother’s sister, her husband and their daughter who live in the same condominium.[^139] In school, they get to interact with students from all over the world.

77     As the Mother herself has acknowledged, the children are getting an amazing and unique exposure to different cultures.[^140] This, as the Mother has also pointed out, is a great foundation to have. Such multicultural exposure at an early age broadens their minds, develops their confidence and stands them in good stead. At the same time, their natural affiliation with Portuguese culture through their interactions with their parents, grandparents and relatives and the yearly holiday visits to Portugal would have deepened their Portuguese roots. The current arrangement has worked well for the development of the children as they have turned out to be confident, well-rounded and well-adjusted. The monocultural plan proposed by the Mother appears to be a regressive step in a globalised world compared to the rich multicultural exposure the children are currently experiencing.

#### The son’s NS obligations

78     I return now to the son’s NS obligations. Through her counsel’s letter dated 30 May 2019, the Mother indicates that she is willing to renounce the PR statuses for herself and her children. The Immigration and Checkpoint Authority (“ICA”) has confirmed that renunciation of the PR status may be done when Xavier is at any age. Xavier is currently 6 years old and does not require an Exit Permit (“EP”). An EP is only required for a PR at 13 years of age. In any event, if the Mother and her children are granted the relocation and have not renounced their PR status on time when Xavier turns 13 years, the Mother will apply for an EP for Xavier and will ensure compliance of the obligations while they reside in the UK. The Mother confirms that she will be in full compliance of any regulations and directions by the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and the ICA, including a possibility that Xavier is required to return to Singapore.

79     The Mother contends that even if Xavier would need to return to serve NS in the future, this factor in itself does not outweigh the Mother’s application. Citing precedent cases, the Mother contends that the courts have been willing in the past to grant relocation for male children who will need to return to Singapore to complete their NS obligations. The courts had not put “determinative any weight” on the subject of NS when deciding the relocation, but merely considered it before relocation was ultimately granted.

80     The Father, through his counsel’s letter dated 4 June 2019, confirms that in order for Xavier to avoid having to serve NS, he will need to renounce his PR status. The Father highlights that the renunciation of PR status is a decision that falls within the ambit of joint custody. The renunciation of PR status is an extremely serious matter and is not a decision that should be made on a whim. The Father states that if the Mother wishes to renounce Xavier’s PR status, she should discuss this matter with the Father.

81     The Father is concerned that if Xavier renounces his PR status without completing NS, it is likely to preclude Xavier from any future application for PR status. Thus, if Xavier’s PR status is renounced, it will prejudice his future ability to return to Singapore to live in the long-term, and there may be an adverse impact on the parties’ own PR statuses as well. Hence, the Mother should not be unilaterally making decisions to renounce Xavier’s PR status.

82     The requirement to serve NS is a relevant consideration in a relocation application (see _UFZ_ at \[40\] when the child’s NS obligations were discussed under the heading “_Other relevant considerations_”). The court must be satisfied that the relocating parent has thought through the consequences of relocation on the NS requirements (see HCF/DT 4196/2012 cited in _UFZ_ (at \[14\]) where the court noted that “\[t\]he Mother has thought through the consequences of relocation on NS requirements and has assured the Court that she will apply for any exit permit for \[Eric\] and ensure he returns to serve NS”).

83     In the present case, it does not appear that the Mother has given sufficient thought to the consequences of the relocation on Xavier’s NS obligations. The Mother has proceeded on the initial assumption that Xavier will not get called up for NS if he leaves Singapore before turning 11. It is now clear that the assumption is incorrect. Xavier is required to fulfil his NS obligations unless his PR status is renounced. Leaving Singapore in a hurry will not make a difference. The Mother now says that she is prepared to renounce the Singapore PR statuses for herself and her children. This unilateral decision on her part without consulting the Father appears to be an incidental decision rather than a considered one. The Mother did not appear to have considered whether it is in the best interests of the children to renounce their PR statuses in Singapore where they were born and brought up. The Mother intends to relocate permanently to the UK but as the Father has pointed out, there is a real risk that the Mother and the Children will not even have a right of abode in the UK when Brexit occurs. This is because the Mother and children are not UK citizens. Although the Mother now says that she is prepared to ensure that Xavier return to Singapore to serve NS if that this is required, the causal manner in which these decisions were taken does not inspire confidence that the Mother has given careful consideration to these important matters or that the decisions were made with sufficient regard to the welfare of the children in mind.

## Welfare of the children

84     To reiterate, “there is **_only one fundamental_** – indeed, **_critical_** – legal principle upon which everything else (including the ultimate decision of the case itself) depends. And it is this – in considering relocation applications, **_the welfare of the child is paramount and this principle ought to override any other consideration_**” (_BNS v BNT_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGCA 23</span> at \[19\]).

85     The Mother’s wish to relocate to the UK, whilst understandable from the perspective that she should be free to start life anew after her divorce, comes with trade-offs that would adversely impact the welfare of the children. The stability which the children currently enjoy will be disrupted without any real benefit to them. The relocation will result in a significant loss of relationship with the Father. The sudden absence of the Father from their lives will be all the more distressing for the children at a time when the presence of both parents is most needed to help them cope with the drastic changes. This is likely to have an adverse impact on the children’s ability to adapt in the UK and their emotional and psychological wellbeing. The children are currently doing very well in every aspect of their lives. Other than the Mother’s wish to relocate, there is no cogent reason to uproot them. As the Mother has the real option of staying in Singapore and the relocation if allowed would be at the expense of the welfare of the children, I do not find the wish to relocate to be a reasonable one. I find, in this regard, the following observations in _TAA_ (at \[18\]) to be especially pertinent:

A parent with care of the children is no longer as free to live life as he or she may have been had he or she been single or divorced without children. Parents in functional families make sacrifices in their lifestyles all the time for their children. One may have to decline an attractive overseas job posting because of the needs of the children. Raising children requires heavy commitment. The law expects no less from parents in post-divorce circumstances. This is not to say that the law does not recognise the difficulties and pain parents may have to bear, but children do grow up and such sacrifice is not demanded endlessly of a parent. Sacrifices may have to be made temporarily in the years when the children require them. The law chooses to place the welfare of the child above all else.

86     The Mother plans to relocate permanently to the UK but there is a real risk that the Mother and the children will not even have the right of abode after Brexit. The Mother’s decision to renounce the children’s Singapore PR statuses appears to be hasty decision just so as to get through the relocation application. It does not appear to be a considered decision with sufficient regard to the welfare of the children. As noted in _TAA_ (at \[20\]), “\[t\]he law will not permit hastily made unilateral plans that fail to consider the welfare of the children. But well made plans that promote both the common interests of the parent and the children can be considered.” The renunciation of the PR statuses was not even discussed with the Father.

87     Weighing all the different factors, I find that it would be contrary to the welfare of the children for this court to grant the relocation application. Accordingly, the application is dismissed. As noted in _TAA_ (at \[20\]), “\[a\] refusal to allow relocation at the time of application does not necessarily mean that a future relocation can never be possible”. At this point, I do not find the relocation to be in the interests of the children.

## Procedural arguments

88     Before concluding, I should for completeness mention that the Father has in addition to the substantive arguments on the merits of the relocation application, raised a procedural matter in respect of an alleged defect in the summons application. The Father contends that SUM 237 is defective in that the Mother has not invoked any statutory provision in support of SUM 237, whether in the title to the action or in the “grounds of application” section of her “summons or otherwise”.[^141] The Father also contends that that the Mother must first show that there has been a material change in circumstances on the supposition that the application was made pursuant to s 128 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353).[^142]

89     I did not find any merit in these lines of arguments. There is no requirement in the Family Justice Rules or the Family Justice Courts Practice Directions which mandates that the relevant statutory provision must be expressly spelt out in the “summons or otherwise”. Counsel for the Father has not provided any authority in support of the argument either. With respect to the second argument on the need to prove a material change in circumstances, one needs look no further than _TAA_ (at \[3\]) which similarly involved an application for relocation after the divorce was finalised and ancillary orders made with regard to the custody, care and control of and access to the children. The legal principle applied by the court was the welfare of the child. There was no separate inquiry into a material change in circumstances. Even where an application is expressly framed as a variation application such as in _ULA v UKZ_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHCF 19</span> (“_ULA_”) (at \[9\]), the court had applied the same welfare principle (_ULA_ at \[24\]). As such, I find the argument made to be wholly unsupported by any case authority.

90     Be that as it may, this does not affect the outcome of the case. Based on the substantive merits, I have found that the relocation would not be in the best interests of the children.

## Conclusion

91     For the above reasons, the Mother’s application in SUM 237 is dismissed. I would encourage parties to agree on the issue of costs. If there is no agreement, they are to file and exchange submissions on the issue of costs within 21 days from the date of this judgment.
