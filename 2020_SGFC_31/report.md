Family law – Guardianship of Infants Act – Care and control

18 March 2020

### District Judge Kathryn Thong:

## Introduction

1       These are my grounds of decision for granting the Plaintiff Father sole care and control of parties’ son, J. The Defendant Mother appealed against my decision as she wanted sole care and control; the Father appealed against the joint custody order.

2       In all the circumstances as they stood at this time, I could not find it would be in J’s best interests to be in his Mother’s care and control even though he was affectionate towards her during the supervised visitation (“SV”) sessions as observed in the various DSSA reports.

## Background

3       The 49-year-old Father is a Director in an Accounts Executive role earning more than $25,000 a month and the 36-year-old Mother is unemployed and has been an undischarged bankrupt since July 2013.

4       Parties married after a whirlwind romance. Shortly after meeting each other, the Mother had moved in with the Father in April 2016 and quickly fell pregnant. It appeared that both were keen to have a child and parties married in October 2016.

5       J was born in March 2017 and the Mother stayed home to care for J. Home then was a rented 3-storey landed property. A domestic helper engaged by the Father also assisted her and to this day, this helper cares for J.

6       Trouble brewed early in the marriage. The Mother had cut up photo albums; smashed crockery; wielded a scissors in front of the Father amongst other unusual behaviour. The Father had some inkling then that the Mother could be extreme in her behaviour and was on medication. As the Court appointed psychiatrist, Dr S. would later point out in his report: “\[The Father\] was aware that \[the Mother\] did not have a stable family background or any social network but his desire to have a child did not let him act on those warning signs.”

7       Matters escalated in October 2017 when the Mother repeatedly sent expletive laden messages to the Father concerning him and his family. She also sent vitriolic messages to the Father’s sister; on one occasion, this numbered up to 180 messages even though the sister deigned to respond to any of these messages. Many of these messages were accusatory and referred to the Father’s sister, her husband and their son being murderers and rapists.

8       The Father also obtained a memo dated 5 December 2017 from an IMH psychiatrist who saw the Mother in October 2017. In the memo, the said psychiatrist stated she had reason to believe that: “the current marital crisis is activating her borderline personality traits, leading to being easily triggered into episodic agitation, intense anger, violent gestures and paranoid ideation….If she is currently experiencing \[an episode of intense agitation\], she may require a safe and secure psychiatric environment for her containment and in which to stabilise.”

9       On 10 January 2018, the Father told the Mother to take a shower after which the family would go for a walk. Unbeknownst to the Mother, whilst she was in the shower, the Father took J, the helper and left the matrimonial home for good.

10     On the same day, the Father’s then solicitors, wrote to the Mother that in the interim, parties could have joint custody of J with sole care and control to the Father, and she could see J only on a supervised basis.

11     Eventually, there was an agreement for the Mother to have supervised access at Paragon. On 17 January 2018, after access ended, the Mother refused to return J to the Father as agreed. The police were called in where the Mother claimed the Father had kidnapped J. Parties then proceeded to Tanglin Police station whereupon the Mother warded J at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (“KKH”), alleging that J had a whooping cough and had been abused.

12     The Father then took out OSG 12/2018 on an urgent basis and the Mother did likewise shortly thereafter, _vide_ OSG 21/2018. On 26 January 2018, an interim order was made for J to remain at KKH and for parties to have equal access to the child.

13     Child Protection Services (“CPS”) subsequently got involved when a referral was made to it on 19 January 2018. CPS brokered an arrangement between parties to care for J whilst he was warded in KKH. However, there were problems with carrying out the agreement. CPS expressed concerns over the Mother’s mental and emotional instability and inability to abide by the visitation agreement. It thus invoked on 8 February 2018, the Protector’s Order for J to be committed to a place of safety, _i.e._ KKH, until the matter could be brought to the Youth Court’s attention.

14     On 9 February 2018, the Youth Court made a care and protection order, finding _inter alia_, that the Mother was uncooperative in disclosing her mental health history and that J “was at risk of being ill-treated by the Mother”. He also found that “there is a risk that the Mother would act in an unreasonable and/or unstable manner which is likely to endanger the safety of the child.”

15     CPS subsequently delivered a report on 6 April 2018 where they found that there were no care or protection concerns and recommended that the order for care and protection lapse. The Youth Court agreed and declined to make further orders.

16     On 17 May 2018, a consent order was recorded after mediation for the Mother to have supervised exchange of J at the DSSA every Monday, from 2pm to 6pm, pending the final hearing of OSG 12/2018 and OSG 21/2018.

17     However, before the final hearing, the Father filed on 12 June 2018 and thereafter, a series of interlocutory applications for discovery and interrogatories against various medical professionals. In response, the Mother took out an application for increased interim access.

18     Counsel for the Father, Ms Foo Soon Yien, urged the Court to order discovery of: “ \[a\]ll medical and/or clinical records, including but not limited to notes, memos, and reports, whether recorded electronically, typed or handwritten, and correspondence between \[the relevant hospital/the relevant doctor\] and the \[Mother and/or the Mother’s representatives and/or the Mother’s solicitors\] relating to \[the Mother’s\] psychiatric/medical condition and treatments and/or consultation with \[the relevant Doctor\].

19     The summonses also prayed for the Father’s solicitors to inspect and take copies of the same if required, and for an order of cross-examination to be made against the relevant doctors if there were inadequate and/or in dispute.

20     The Father’s case was simply that the Mother clearly had a mental condition which he was very precise about – borderline personality disorder (“BPD”) – and that she needed to be assessed. After having uncovered her patient history at the IMH and having discovered how many psychiatrists she had been visiting and how much medication she had obtained from them, the Father wanted the Mother to have supervised access only. It was clear that J could be in danger, as the Mother was not only emotionally unstable as seen from her tirades of abuse against the Father and his family, but also the fact that such medication had side effects and the Mother appeared to be consuming large doses of them.

21     The Mother through her counsel, Mr Imran Khwaja and Mr Hariram, case contended that her psychiatrist (at \[11\] above) had merely stated she had BPD _traits_. It was a leap to suggest that she had BPD itself. All the Mother had was social anxiety disorder. The Father was running a vicious campaign that the Mother had a mental condition when she was the primary caregiver of J and nothing impaired her ability to care for J. While she had indeed purchased benzodiazepines from various psychiatrists, her principal psychiatrist had simply ordered to take them on an “as need” basis. The said psychiatrist had found that there was no contraindication to the Mother caring for J.

22     Mr Khwaja submitted that the Father had obviously intended to thwart the final hearing by applying for discovery and interrogatories at such a late stage, and to further deprive the Mother of access. Giving the Father access to the underlying memos _etc_. would also give the Father more ammunition to perpetuate the falsehood that the Mother was mentally unfit to care for J.

23     Ms Foo countered that the Father had found out about the Mother’s visit to various psychiatrists because she had made the claims for their payment through his employer. It was only when he approached his employers for details of the claims that he discovered the copious amounts of medications she had been consuming. If there was nothing that the Mother was hiding, why could she not just consent to the disclosure of her medical records? Instead she persisted in being uncooperative just as she was with CPS, which was why the Father was compelled to take out these discovery and interrogatories applications. I thought Mr Khwaja’s rejoinder made much intuitive – why should the Mother he contended, who was mentally sound, allow such an invasion of her privacy and fodder to propagate more lies?

24     As I had indicated to Ms Foo at the hearing, I did not see the need for such extensive discovery and interrogatories, and less reason for the Father to have access to the underlying documents. In any event, the Father appealed against my decision to adjourn these applications to when the Court psychiatrist was appointed, if at all.

25     I will not delve into the minutiae of what transpired thereafter, save that I appointed a Court expert, Dr S., from the IMH to assess the Mother. I was concerned about the not insignificant amounts of medical drugs the Mother had purchased, even though there was no direct evidence that she was consuming them. The somewhat blithe explanation that she was directed to take them on an “as need” basis failed to explain why she had to visit more than seven psychiatrists in a span of 9 months and obtained large quantities of Xanax and Valium from them. While there had yet to be any medical evidence that the Mother was not sound as the Father claimed _ad infinitum_, and no evidence of direct harm on J, given the circumstances, I needed to be satisfied as to the state of her mental health.

26     Three issues were set out for Dr S. to address: (i) whether the Mother has a psychiatric condition(s) or any other mental health issues; (ii) should the Mother possess any mental health issues or present with any such concerns, how does that impact her daily living and interactions with people, if at all? and (iii) following from (ii), what would possible treatment options be and the expected duration of such treatment(s). The various psychiatrists who were the subject of the Father’s discovery and interrogatories applications were to grant Dr S. access to the Mother’s psychiatric records and other relevant information, if requested. The Father would have no such access to these records.

27     Eventually, Dr S. found that the Mother had:

> (i)     “limited or poor capacity to regulate emotions in day to day social situations”

> (ii)     “limited or impaired capacity to sustain close, mutually meaningful relationship with her own family members, friends as well as others”

> (iii)     “limited or poor ability to sustain and grow in occupational functioning” and

> (iv)     “limited or poor financial discretion and management skills”.

28     He continued that such behaviour and functioning had been present since adolescence or early adulthood “without showing signs of attenuation over the years so far”. It was thus “possible to conclude that \[the Mother\] has certain dysfunctional personality traits. A diagnosis of Personality Disorder, although likely, is best kept in abeyance due to lack of adequate objective information from her own family members, relatives and friends who have known her for many years…”.

29     After the IMH report was delivered to the Court and counsel, Mr Hariram informed the Court at a case conference that the Mother had issues with some matters raised in the report, for which she wanted to “set the record straight”. Ms Foo countered that this would mean the psychiatrist would have to be given an opportunity to respond and I agreed. In the end, both counsel agreed that the final hearing would proceed without further delay and the Mother would not be filing a further affidavit to set the record straight.

30     By this time, the Mother had been having paid tranches of SV sessions at the DSSA. The Father paid for these sessions. While the Mother could have access outside the DSSA subject to supervision by a person assessed to be suitable by the DSSA, the Mother had been unable to find anyone to supervise such access. Her mother had initially been supervising such access, but dropped out after the Mother had an argument with her. The Mother’s access was thus limited to the DSSA SV sessions.

## Parties positions at the hearing

#### The Mother’s case

31     Mr Hariram submitted that the Mother had always been the primary caregiver before J was taken from her at 10 months old. Despite being deprived of access to J, he continued to enjoy the limited time with the Mother, demonstrating that mother and child shared a close bond.

32     Further, there was no adverse report from the DSSA in relation to the Mother’s interactions with J. In fact, none of the authorities – DSSA, CPS or the Youth Court had found any behaviour of concern.

33     As for the Mother’s alleged mental condition, Mr Hariram submitted that the Father had been running a cruel campaign that she had a “mental condition” and was unfit to care for J. This was a contrived case from the manner in which the Father misrepresented the Mother’s mental condition to various third parties, and how he kept shifting his stance in the proceedings, from allowing unsupervised access to then insisting on supervised access.

34     The Father’s case was run on speculation – “what if” the Mother harmed J, but there was simply nothing in evidence to show that she presented with such a likelihood simply because she had visited several psychiatrists and obtained medication from them.

35     The fact of the matter was that the Mother had no mental condition which would prevent her from caring for the child. That she had been able to withstand the constant pressure of the proceedings was reason enough for the Court to find that nothing impairs her ability to care for J.

36     In relation to the IMH report, Mr Hariram submitted that little weight ought to be placed on it as most of the information was derived from an information pack provided by the Father. Affidavits were also provided by the Father but it was unclear if the Mother’s responses were supplied as well. In essence, the Father had likely provided information that was advantageous to him and had a certain narrative that favoured him.

37     He also pointed out that Dr S. had placed much emphasis on the Mother’s (chequered) past when it was the Mother’s present mental health and condition that were relevant.

38     Further, he had not assessed the Mother and the child together, and his views should be given little weight as they did not shed light on which parent would be better suited to care for J. (To be fair, this was not asked of Dr S. nor did he opine on this issue).

39     Notwithstanding the above, Mr Hariram sought to rely on Dr S.’s finding that J would be the “most important stabilising factor” for the Mother, and urged the Court to grant the Mother care and control of J.

40     In any event, a mental condition should not be an impediment to the Mother having care and control. In this vein, Mr Hariram cited several authorities where the mother was granted care and control, the first of which was _ACU v ACR_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 1 SLR 1235</span> (“_ACU v ACR_”) where the mother had threatened to commit suicide with both children. She had been diagnosed with reactive depression but was granted care and control. The Court agreed that the mother was the primary caregiver and her condition was temporary and would be resolved by the resolution of the marriage. The IMH psychiatrist also found that the mother did not suffer from any psychiatric impairment that would inhibit her from caring for her children, and did not require any follow-up.

41     In _Cheok Wah Jin v Guo Xiao_ Ying <span class="citation">\[2003\] SGDC 72</span>, the mother therein had been diagnosed with acute psychosis by IMH and was diagnosed with Brief Reactive Psychosis. She was nonetheless granted care and control.

42     In _Soon Peck Wah v Woon Che Chye_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] SGCA 49</span>, the mother suffered from post-natal depression and thyrotoxicosis, conditions which made her emotionally unstable. Her condition was however kept under control by medication. The Court noted that even when the mother was not undergoing treatment, she was aggressive only towards her husband and not the infant.

43     In _XQ v XR_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGDC 163</span>, the mother suffered from bipolar disorder and was admitted to IMH on 3 occasions. And in _UIG v UIH_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 149</span>, the mother suffered from psychotic depression. The Court did not think that the mother’s illness would adversely affect her care for the child.

44     The conduct of litigants was also a factor that the Court could consider. Citing _TSF v TSE_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGCA 49</span>, Mr Hariram submitted that the Father’s relentless pursuit of his vicious campaign cast doubt on whether he would be able to guide J and his own ability to judge the correctness of his actions. Indeed, J could well be brainwashed into believing that the Mother was unsound and unable to care for him. It would not be in the best interests for J to be exposed to such behaviour.

45     In this regard, he pointed out that the handovers at the DSSA had not always been smooth as the Father’s family members had been present at the DSSA. This he submitted, was calculated to instigate and provoke the Mother to further his cruel campaign against her, because the family members later filed affidavits against the Mother on the handovers.

46     As for the Father’s claimed support network, the Father’s immediate family were all based in Australia. The only support system he had in Singapore was the domestic helper. His claims that he was the primary caregiver was unbelievable given that he was working full time and there was little to prove that his working hours were as flexible as he claimed to be – after all his job was a demanding one and had an international dimension to it. The helper was obviously the one caring for J mostly and it was undesirable that she be the primary caregiver when the Mother was available to do so.

47     As for the Father’s prayer for sole custody, both parents ought to be involved in J’s life. The Mother had already been deprived of precious growing up experiences and ought not to be deprived further. An order for sole custody would only reward the Father’s “despicable behaviour”.

#### The Father’s case

48     Ms Foo submitted that the Mother had always been hands off with J since he was born, and had shown scant interest in him. She only enjoyed taking photos of J and have the helper dress him in new clothing and go on occasional outings. Some WhatsApp messages revealed the Mother stating that she found J too heavy to carry and was tired and depressed. Most of the time, the Father alleged, she would leave the helper to care for J.

49     As for the submission that there were no care and protection concerns found by the CPS and the Youth Court, Ms Foo pointed out that this was a controlled situation. The Mother had started from 4 hours of access during the period 9 February 2018 to 6 April 2018, and then CPS applied their standard access expansion model which increased it to 6 to 8 hours’ access per week. Given that the Mother was being supervised for such a brief period each time, it was not difficult for her to behave in a manner that would lead CPS and the Youth Court to conclude that there were no protection concerns as of 6 April 2018. They did not have opportunity to witness the Mother’s behaviour when she was not under scrutiny, but the Father and others did.

50     Ms Foo also harped on the CPS’ findings that the Mother was uncooperative in disclosing her mental health history and the Youth Court judge’s finding that J “was at risk of being ill-treated by the Mother” and “there is a risk that the Mother would act in an unreasonable and/or unstable manner which is likely to endanger the safety of the child.” One could not sweep the Father’s concerns under the carpet simply because CPS dropped out eventually.

51     The IMH report by Dr S. finally vindicated the Father’s concerns that the Mother had a mental condition. It was thus untrue that the Father had launched a cruel and vicious campaign against the Mother. The Father initially thought the Mother had BPD because of the memo stating she had BPD traits and their marriage counsellor’s view that she had to undergo some form of therapy, designed for people with BPD. The Father’s belief was proven not to be without basis, as Dr S. explained that a diagnosis of BPD was “likely” but declined to state definitively due to the lack of adequate, objective evidence.

52     Also, the Father was not shifting his case as alleged by the Mother. The reason why he agreed to supervised exchange at the start was because he was unaware then of the number of psychiatrists and amount of medication the Mother had been consuming. Only after the consent order was arrived at did the Father manage to obtain these receipts. It shocked him that the Mother was consuming copious amounts of medication and J’s safety was a real concern.

53     In fact, the Mother’s bizarre pattern of behaviour began early on in the marriage. Before meeting the Father, the Mother had a host of issues as the IMH report revealed. Ms Foo iterated that the Father’s concerns had always and only been J’s best interests. It was not speculative to suggest that J could be harmed by the Mother because she was simply so unstable as evidenced by various psychiatrists and third parties. Her behaviour and language were appalling and she had episodes of rages where she would sent avalanches of text messages to the Father and his family members, accusing them of vile things. It could not be in J’s interests to grow up with such a mother.

54     There was no reason to cast doubt on Dr S.’s report. Ms Foo pointed out that Dr S. himself had highlighted in the report that there were conflicting sources of information and yet, had come to the findings that he did. Further, it was always open to the Mother to provide her own information pack to Dr S. and there was no basis for the Mother to suggest he had been biased.

55     As for J being the “most important stabilising factor” for the Mother, this certainly could not be a basis to grant the Mother care and control – the test was what was in J’s best interests, not the Mother’s.

56     As for the authorities relied on, Ms Foo sought to distinguish them as follows. In _ACU v ACR_, the Court therein had relied on a recent report, whereas in the present case, the only report favourable to the Mother was from an assessment made in October 2017. Further, the Mother was not J’s primary caregiver.

57     As for _Soon Peck Wah_, the psychiatrist had found that the mother no longer suffered from post-natal depression and that her conditions were well controlled with maintenance medication. Here, there was uncertainty over the Mother’s mental state and whether it was under control.

58     In _Cheok Wah Jin v Guo Xiao_ Ying, the mother had an episode of psychosis in 1997 but was given a clean bill of health in 2002. The mother there was involved in the children’s care and the father in that case was too preoccupied with his business and in dire financial straits. In contrast, the Mother here presented with numerous red flags over her mental health and she did not have a clean bill of health. The Father was also an involved parent.

59     As for _UIG v UIH_, by the time the Court passed judgment, the mother had been discharged by her doctor. This was unlike the Mother’s case here where she was still visiting psychiatrists and obtaining large quantities of medication.

60     Last but not least, in _XQ v XR_, the mother’s psychiatrists had reported her favourable response towards treatment and she had progressed from requiring 4 types of medication to just one type. Here however, the Mother had been prescribed with numerous types of medication and had not shown evidence of improvement or stability.

61     In relation to _TSF v TSE_, it was the Mother’s own conduct that should preclude her from having care and control. There was no merit to the submission that the Father was running any cruel campaign against the Mother.

62     As for the handovers at the DSSA where the Father’s family members were present, CPS had previously designated his family as “safe adults” and the Court had allowed the Father to appoint proxies to drop off and pick up J. The Father was working and could not always make it for these sessions. The Father’s family were close to him and had offered to help care for J when they were in Singapore. There was nothing sinister in them being present at the DSSA.

63     As regards the Father’s prayer for sole custody, Ms Foo submitted that the Mother’s dysfunctional personality traits as identified by Dr S., coupled with a poor track record of compliance with treatment, meant it would be impossible for parties to co-operate. An example of the Mother’s un-cooperation was refusing to allow the Father to enrol J in a renowed preschool or to apply for an Australian passport for J. (The Father is Australian). Joint custody should only be awarded where there is a reasonable prospect of parties cooperating.

## My decision

64     In _VET v VEU_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHCF 4</span>, the High Court observed at \[14\]:

> A child’s welfare refers to her well-being in every aspect, that is, her well-being in the most exhaustive sense of that word. It refers to her physical, intellectual, psychological, emotional, moral and religious well-being. It refers to her well-being both in the short term and in the long term: _UKM v Attorney-General_ at \[45\]; _TSF v TSE_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 2 SLR 833</span> at \[51\] and \[52\].

65     In _ABW v ABV_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 769</span> (“_ABW v ABV_”) at \[23\], the High Court observed that in considering the child’s welfare, matters such as the importance of maintaining ties of affection enjoyed by the child (_Soon Peck Wah v Woon Che Chye_ \[1997\] 3 SLR(R) 43) was important. Other circumstances to be taken into account included the need for both parents to be involved in the child’s life, stability for the child, the maternal bond and which parent shows the greater concern for the child.

66     While I was of the view that J and the Mother shared a fairly close bond, its mere existence was not a presumption of care and control being granted in favour of the Mother and cannot be the sum total of the analysis.

67     I noted that for the first 10 months of J’s life when the Mother cared for J with the assistance of the domestic helper, nothing untoward had happened to him, and even the Father himself did not allege that J was in danger. There were also no adverse reports from the DSSA on J’s interactions with the Mother.

68     While these factors were in the Mother’s favour, when weighed against the other concerns posed by her behaviour and her personal circumstances, they were not enough to cross the threshold of it being in J’s welfare or best interests to be in her care and control.

69     The Mother has a volatile temperament as seen in the vitriolic messages she sent to the Father’s family members which I will not reproduce here. Suffice to say, many of them were vulgar, pregnant with hatred and plainly bizarre.

70     I recognise that in the throes of a tumultuous marriage, she may have gotten into rages which she also did express regret over on occasion. Insofar as this was past behaviour, I found that these instances revealed what the Mother was capable of, but what was more relevant was how she reacted and managed her anger going forward.

71     Yet, at the DSSA handovers when some of the Father’s family members were present, the Mother was triggered by their presence. She flew into a rage and called the Father’s sister’s son “autistic” although she claimed this was in response to a vulgarity hurled by the Father’s sister. On another occasion, she described the Father’s mother as a “geriatric” and tried to film her carrying J. Yet in a further incident, she allegedly pinched her own mother in the presence of the Father’s own father and yelled at her. This was witnessed by the Father and his own father.

72     Despite knowing she had limited access to J in the form of these SV sessions, the Mother clearly could not contain her anger and acted bizarrely in front of J, and risked thwarting the access sessions. She was also aware that her behaviour was being observed by the evaluator and that where relevant, feedback would be given to the Court. Knowing all of this did not stop her from being carried away by her anger.

73     The Mother has to learn to manage this aspect of her personality. It was apparent from the various affidavits filed by third parties including but not limited to the Father’s family members, that she was triggered by anyone who she thought sided with the Father, including the domestic helper whom she accused the Father was having an affair with. If she could not exercise self-restraint in a controlled environment such as the DSSA, and whilst in the presence of J, it gave rise to concerns as to how she would behave in a less controlled environment, and whether she was alive to her behaviour’s potential impact on J.

74     While I found it was unlikely that the Mother would wittingly harm J in the physical sense, as stated earlier, the child’s welfare is to be seen in a broader sense. Her intense hatred for the Father’s family meant that if she had care and control, it was almost certain he would not get to see his paternal grandparents and extended family.

75     Even if the Mother did allow J to see them, everyone would be on tenterhooks dealing with the Mother and their contact with J may not be meaningful. An altercation could also result, where J would have to witness the ugly fracas.

76     For the above reasons, I found that should the Mother be awarded care and control, the ties of affection J shared with the Father’s immediate family would be undermined and likely cut off altogether. There was every indication that it would happen with the Father as well. After I delivered my decision, I made interim orders of supervised access to the Mother pending further evidence on parties’ schedules and J’s schedule. However, the Mother has since forgone that access to J because she does not want to see the Father. This reinforces my belief _ex post_ that she would keep J away from the Father should she have care and control.

77     I was thus of the view that there was a real risk that J could lose his relationship with the Father and the extended family, should the Mother be granted care and control. Whereas the Father was generally facilitative of the DSSA-SV sessions and appeared to be more reasonable about access. In _ABW v ABV_, it was precisely this trait that tipped the scales in favour of the parent who was granted care and control.

78     Apart from the Mother’s behaviour, I found also that she was bereft of close relationships with kith or kin. She herself stated she had no family support. Yet, when I ordered supervised access outside the DSSA, it was her own mother who she was estranged from, who stepped in to supervise access. Unfortunately, she ceased helping the Mother after the Mother had an argument with her (see \[74\] above). From 21 February 2019, the Mother could not have access outside the DSSA as her mother was unavailable to supervise the access.

79     The Mother then rued to the Court she was being set up for failure as the access ordered outside the DSSA was on weekdays, and none of her friends could make it to supervise her access. The Court thus additionally ordered alternate weekend access in May 2019. Even then, no one came forward to help her - the Mother even tried to enlist the help of several domestic helpers.

80     In contrast, the Father has a strong support network even as they are based in Australia. They are close enough to him such that they tried to intervene when the marital woes began, and before litigation commenced. In particular, the Father’s sister had good-naturedly sent emails to the Mother urging her to be more tolerant of the Father who she conceded, was not the easiest to get along with. Whether it was intervention or interference is a matter of the each party’s perspective and is beside the point. The point was that it was clear that the Father’s family are people whom J can turn to for love and affection, support and guidance, and that is important in his psychological, emotional well being, and gaining the necessary social skills. In December 2019, J had also travelled with the Father to visit his grandparents and other relatives in Australia. This was in stark contrast to the Mother’s circumstances, where even at J’s birth, none of her family was present. It is truly unfortunate and may not be the Mother’s fault that she has no kith or kin to rely on. But the fact remains that she did not have close relationships with anyone.

81     I thus found that the inexorable conclusion was should care and control be granted to the Mother, J would likely not form meaningful, life-giving relationships with other people given the Mother’s seemingly isolationist existence. She was also without a job despite the Court’s urging in March 2019 that she re-enters the workforce. Thus, even colleagues at the workplace could not be a source of friendship for her. As Dr S.’s report noted, she only had “transient” relationships.

82     In my view, J’s best interests would be best served with the Father even as the Father was heavily assisted by the domestic helper. Mr Hariram submitted that it was unsatisfactory that J was being cared for by a domestic helper rather than his natural mother. I agree it is most unfortunate. However, the Court can only decide based on the circumstances before it and not idealised scenarios, and it is worth noting that the Mother had no complaint about the Father’s care of J save that he overstates how much time he actually spends with him. In any event, J is now in preschool and does not spend as much time at home.

83     Apart from the Mother’s personality and poor / absent relationships with others, I found her dependency on benzodiazepines troubling. It suggested a lack of control over managing herself. She was no doubt an intelligent and resourceful woman, but this dependency was not in her own interests in the long run which she admitted to Dr S. . Even without the benefit of an expert opinion, the available evidence revealed an inability to regulate her emotions, thereby impacting her relationships with others. As I have set out earlier, this was manifested in her dealings with the Father, his family members and even her own family.

84     I turn to the findings of Dr S.’s report. As there was no challenge formally brought on it, I saw no reason to reject Dr S.’s findings. Even if there were inaccuracies in reporting the parties’ and other interviewees’ accounts as alleged by the Mother, the observations made were consistent with what this Court would have inferred from the available evidence.

85     Dr S. found that notwithstanding the various conflicting accounts/information, he could make the findings as set out at \[30\] and \[31\] above and diagnosed the Mother as “Benzodiazepine dependence and Anxiety disorder with dysfunctional personality traits”.

86     He also observed that the Mother’s problem of benzodiazepine dependence was a “fall out of her anxiety problems as well as her tendency to self-medicate to stave off the withdrawal symptoms.” Yet, her anxiety or depressive issues was not an “independent clinical state” but rather ought to be viewed as “the symptomatic expression of her inflexible personality traits.”

87     The most important stabilizing factor for the Mother he noted, was the company and association of J. However, she would need to be “under strict treatment regimen, preferably an addiction specialist, and must stop self-medicating with benzodiazepines. She has to engage in long term counselling sessions that should aim to improve her control of emotions, interpersonal skills and tolerance of others’ behaviour.”

88     He also noted the Mother’s poor history of poor compliance with therapist and her frequent change of specialists. Nonetheless, he was hopeful that the Mother’s motivations to be a good mother and improve her personal circumstances would ensure she does not fall back into bad habits.

89     Dr S.’s observations and diagnosis, coupled with the Mother’s lack of a support network meant as far as this Court was concerned, it simply could not be J’s best interests to be in her care and control. She had to manage herself first, before raising her child. While J may not immediately or directly be in harm’s way should the Mother have care and control of him, in the long-term, he could well continue to be collateral damage in the fall out the Mother has with the Father, his family and other persons.

90     As I pointed out to Mr Hariram, if the Mother sought the necessary treatment, and demonstrated stability in her life through for instance, securing a job, matters may look very different by the time the ancillaries are heard. It was not immutable that the Father would have care and control.

91     At this juncture, I address briefly the authorities relied on by Mr Hariram. I find that those cases concerned mothers whose conditions were temporary and/or for which, a course of treatment had been prescribed and complied with, thereby auguring well for their recovery (if they had not already recovered). The Mother in the present case did not fit into any of these scenarios, even as she indicated to Dr S. that she was motivated to change.

92     As for the issue of custody, I ordered joint custody, which was what the Father had initially prayed for, though he changed his position in the course of these proceedings.

93     The law is clear that joint custody is to be the norm and acrimony in and of itself is insufficient for a sole custody order to be made. The Mother at least at this point in time, deserved to have a say in the major decisions concerning J who was still very young. She was attuned to J’s interests and the DSSA sessions largely had positive feedback on her responding to J’s needs during the session. It would be in J’s interests for the Mother to be consulted on major decisions in his life for her to lend her perspective on matters and so that J does not grow up believing that his mother has abandoned him or does not care for his welfare.

94     This concern that J does not feel abandoned is particularly significant given that historically, there had been a period of two months or so where the Mother had not seen J, and yet did not ask the Father how J was faring or ask to see J remotely. (This was after her own mother had ceased supervising access outside the DSSA.) As I would be ordering supervised access and no longer ordering SV at the DSSA, an order of sole custody would most likely cut her out of J’s life.

## Postscript

95     No one should arrogate to themselves the right to describe someone as being mentally disordered no matter how sincere their belief. That is the preserve of experts such as psychiatrists and/or psychologists, not counsel nor spouses. Mental illness is complex. A litigant instructing his counsel does no service to his case to allege that his spouse is mentally unsound in the absence of cogent medical evidence; a counsel is of little assistance to the Court repeating claims of mental unsoundness as the mere mouthpiece of the client. Flogging the allegation that a parent is mentally unfit on little more than inferences or extrapolation, can give rise to a perception that a party is attempting to distract the Court from the actual inquiry of what is truly in the best interests of a child and to instead focus on the other party’s mental health. As I indicated at the various interlocutory hearings, the fact that the Mother may have a mental illness was beside the point – the question was whether such an illness if any, affected her ability to raise J independently.

96     Marital disputes especially where a child is concerned, can bring out the worst in people. In _AZZ v BAA_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 44</span>, the High Court piquantly observed at \[40\]:

> Any marriage, even a short one, endows each spouse with an intimate knowledge of the other spouse’s trigger points. When the parties’ relationship breaks down, _it is all too easy for one spouse to use that knowledge to engage in ostensibly innocuous behaviour which is in fact carefully calculated to provoke the other spouse and then to present the retaliatory response to the provocation to the court as evidence_ of acrimony warranting excluding the retaliating spouse from custody. \[own emphasis\]

97     The Father was always aware of the Mother’s instability as Dr S. pointed out. I would not discount the possibility that some of the Father’s actions had the _effect_ whether intended or otherwise, of wearing the Mother down.

98     If it is a party’s case that his spouse has a mental disorder or a pre-disposition towards one, then he should take extra care to avoid worsening or triggering the condition. Waging litigation upon litigation under the banner of “best interests of the child” might actually undercut his case, for how does it advance a child’s interests for a parent’s mental health to suffer through unending and tedious litigation? To this end, I urge all counsel to be sensitive and mindful of the nature and modalities of their litigation strategy where allegations of mental illnesses are concerned. One should not be trumpeting to all and sundry – the police, neighbours, and other third parties and the Court, that a spouse has a mental disorder. There is already much needless stigma surrounding mental illnesses. A spouse with mental health issues may then seek to conceal the true extent of her condition and delay seeking treatment, for fear of being labelled “mentally unstable” and prejudiced in the litigation. As the authorities produced by Mr Hariram has shown, mental conditions do not in and of themselves militate against the granting of care and control. Rather, it is the effect of such mental conditions and how it correlates to a child’s welfare. Otherwise, decrying a spouse’s mental condition is no different from telling the Court that a spouse has a bad temper.

99     Without her solicitors, I think it would have been much harder for the Mother to “withstand the pressure of the litigation” as Mr Hariram put it. As divorce proceedings are afoot and contested, I hope good sense can prevail on both sides and parties can soon move on with their lives whilst co-parenting J.
