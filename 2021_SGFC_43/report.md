Family law – Ancillary matters

23 April 2021

### District Judge Kathryn Thong:

## Introduction

1       This was a long marriage of 30 years which produced two sons who were 23 and 26 years old at the time of the hearing. The only issues were thus the division of assets, spousal maintenance and maintenance for the younger son, whom I shall refer to by the pseudonym, ‘Jack’.

2       The known asset pool which included the matrimonial flat (“the flat”) and a condominium unit (“the condo”) that was under construction at the time, came up to $2,742,888.15.

3       Adopting the classification methodology for the division of assets, I ordered that the Plaintiff Wife (“the Wife”) was entitled to 55% of the matrimonial pool (excluding the condo) and the Defendant Husband (“the Husband”), the remaining 45% of the matrimonial pool.

4       As for the condo, I ordered that the Wife was entitled to 31% of the _net_ value of the condo and the Husband entitled to 69% of the same. Parties were to retain all assets held in their sole names unless agreed otherwise, and they were to work out the consequential orders between themselves.

5       No spousal maintenance was ordered for the Wife and a sum of $6,650 as backdated maintenance for Jack was ordered against the Husband.

6       The above orders were made on 3 April 2020. On 15 June 2020, the Husband filed an application for extension of time to file his notice of appeal out of time. On 4 December 2020, Judicial Commissioner Tan Puay Boon granted the application. Hence, these grounds.

## Background facts

7       Parties married in May 1988. Interim judgment (“IJ”) was granted on 12 June 2018 on the basis that the Husband had behaved in such a way that the Wife could not reasonably be expected to live with him. Such behaviour included the Husband requesting the Wife to accept his mistress into the family and into the matrimonial home, which the Wife agreed to.

8       At the time of the hearing, the Wife was 56 years old and earning a gross income of some $5,600 as a technician in the civil service. The Husband was 54 years old and a self-employed financial consultant with a declared income of some $1,290 though in the preceding year, it averaged around $5,000 per month.

9       Parties were largely working throughout the marriage with both the Husband and Wife working in the civil service when they first married. A POSB joint account (“the Joint Account”) was opened with both parties contributing from their salaries. At the material time, parties’ salaries were about $1,000 to the Wife and $1,300 to the Husband. It was from this Joint Account that most big-ticket expenses were paid such as the renovations for their first flat.

10     Sometime around 1991, the Husband embarked on part-time course to earn a Master’s Degree in Business Administration (“MBA”). It was an endeavour that would take 10 years.

11     Parties’ first son was also born in 1991. Seeking better career prospects, the Husband left the civil service to become a regional marketing and sales director. When he left the civil service, the Wife was earning $3,000 and the Husband, slightly more. His new job entailed much travel to Asia-Pacific.

12     A few years later, parties upgraded to a condominium and with the arrival of their second son, Jake, parties also secured a domestic helper. The family would reside at this condominium for the next 15 years during which time, the Husband was steadily promoted. And when the Husband was appointed Sales and Marketing Director, the family purchased a second car. By then, the Husband was drawing a salary of $10,000.

13     Unfortunately, in 2008/2009, the Husband was retrenched. At the time the Wife was drawing a salary of $4,000 per month and over the next few months, the family depended on her income. After trying his hand as a trainer for three months which paid $4,000 monthly, the Husband decided to call it a day and joined the insurance industry sometime around 2010.

14     When the Husband first started out as an insurance agent, he had no clients, and the family depended once again on the Wife’s salary. Parties also tightened their belt: they sold the second family car, and the family downsized to the current matrimonial flat. Parties also transferred the monies from the Joint Account into the Husband’s personal OCBC bank account at his behest, for more efficient management of parties’ finances. Her salary was meant to meet the household expenses whilst the monies in the Husband’s personal OCBC account was meant to be parties’ savings and for investments.

15     Thereafter, parties ceased contributions towards the Joint Account. However, it remained active because of GIRO arrangements and the Wife would transfer monies into it from time to time to meet these obligations. As a last resort, she would only draw down on the Husband’s above-mentioned OCBC account if there were insufficient monies to meet the family’s expenses.

16     The Husband did well as an insurance agent, and sometime in 2013, he was transferred to a new team and that was presumably when the affair began.

17     Sometime in 2014, the Husband sought the Wife’s acceptance of his mistress to which she reluctantly agreed to. From thereon, the mistress was almost like a part of the family. The Husband claimed in these proceedings that the Wife was happy with this arrangement and was surprised she had cited this as a reason for the divorce.

18     On 30 December 2017, the Wife and both sons left the matrimonial flat. In February 2018, the Wife filed for divorce. In his affidavit and at the hearings, the Husband repeatedly stated that he wanted the Wife to return to his side.

## Parties’ arguments at the hearings

19     At the first hearing of the ancillary matters, I heard and dismissed SUM 1993/2019 which was for an extension of time to file the Husband’s 2nd affidavit of assets and means (“AOM”); there had been unless order for the 2nd AOM to be filed by 11 June 2019, failing which, the ancillary matters hearing would proceed without the 2nd AOM. Notably, the said extension was not the first. In any event, no cogent reasons were given for the delay and the 2nd AOM was scant on evidence.

20     Husband’s counsel at the time, Mr Deveraj, then sought leave to introduce additional documents produced at the hearing itself. According to Mr Devaraj, the Husband had given his firm new evidence just the day before, primarily OCBC bank statements from 2015-2017 that purportedly showed transfers from the Husband’s bank account to other accounts parties had between themselves.

21     Counsel for the Wife, Ms Lim Poh Choo, objected to the application for leave to adduce such further evidence, as the Husband had dragged out the proceedings long enough. She asserted he had failed to comply with discovery orders and had refused to furnish any letters of authorisation for the Wife to seek further information on his multiple insurance policies. He could not claim ignorance as a litigant in person, since he was a Master’s degree holder and had ample time to obtain the documents.

22     I allowed the Husband to exhibit these additional documents by way of a supplementary affidavit and liberty to the Wife to file a reply thereafter.

23     Before me, both counsel also alleged non-disclosure of multiple insurance policies between parties. I ordered parties to furnish to the other a letter of authorisation to disclose the existence of their insurance policies. Counsel were to agree on the parameters of information sought, and it was left to parties to decide which insurance companies to send the letter of authorisation to.

24     The final known asset pool is at **Annex A** and comprises more than 30 insurance policies. I deal below with the assets that were the main source of contention for parties.

## Asset pool

### Parties’ insurance policies

25     The insurers’ replies revealed that the Husband had terminated some policies for which the Wife could not trace the proceeds, and their termination dates unknown - their last known values were as of 2017. The policies may well have been terminated before the marriage broke down and before the divorce was filed. It could also have been terminated after these events. Without a timeframe given that the investment decisions were undertaken by the Husband, I did not think it would be just to include these policies into account.

26     The Wife highlighted that there were only three Manulife policies disclosed by the Husband in his 1st AOM, when the Husband’s bank statements as of 2017 reflected premiums deducted for 7 Manulife policies. Manulife had responded that the Husband had not surrendered any policy before 2014 or purchased any policies after 2014. The continued deduction of the premiums after 2014 meant the policies were still in existence.

27     Mr Deveraj submitted that the letter of authorisation had allowed counsel to seek whatever information they required from the insurance companies. Along the way, both counsel had agreed to limit themselves to a particular timeframe and for Ms Lim to now suggest there had not been full and frank disclosure by the Husband was unfair. I eventually drew an adverse inference against the Husband for these undisclosed policies (see \[68\]) below.

28     Another point of contention was the date adopted for the surrender values of the insurance policies. Ms Lim pointed out that in the Husband’s updated fact and position sheet, for some of his policies, the 2018 and 2019 surrender values were relied on, whilst for most of the Wife’s policies, she had relied on the latest surrender values of January 2020. At a further hearing on 4 March 2020, the Husband indicated he had no issue with the latest surrender values being relied upon for his policies, which were surrender values in 2019 – no 2020 values were produced.

29     For parity, rather than rely on the 2020 figures of the Wife’s insurance policies for which no corresponding values were available for the Husband’s, I relied on the Wife’s figures provided in her AOMs which were from 2018. The Husband had about twice the number of insurance policies as the Wife, and there were about an equal number of the Wife’s policies that relied on the 2018 surrender values, as there were for the Husband’s policies (which were a mixture of 2018 and 2019 values). I found this to be the fairest way to deal with the issue of the Husband’s 2020 surrender values not being available to this Court.

30     Yet another issue was whether the accumulated bonuses ought to be regarded as part of the surrender value. Ms Lim asserted that this should be so, but in _UTT v UTS_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHCF 8</span>, the High Court declined to include the accumulated bonus as part of the surrender value as those bonuses were payable only upon a claim being made or on maturity. They thus could not be considered as the _present_ value of the policies. I thus rejected the Wife’s submission to include the accumulated bonuses.

### The condominium unit (“the condo”)

31     At the time of the first hearing, the estimated temporary occupation permit (“TOP”) date was May 2021. Payment for the unit was via progress payments and at issue was how the unit ought to be valued.

32     Ms Lim submitted that to derive the nett value of the unit, one should adopt the market valuation and minus whatever amount of the loan that had been disbursed by the bank to the developer. This was strenuously objected to by the Husband who explained that as the bank had already agreed to loan them the amount of $600,000, that stood as their liability regardless of when the bank chose to disburse the amount.

33     I agreed with the Husband. The parties’ liabilities towards the bank would be $600,000 plus whatever interest that accrued on it. The fact that the payments by the bank to the developer are ‘progress payments’ simply meant that the diminution in the overall liabilities depended on which stage the construction is at. The more advanced the stage of construction, the more the money that would have to be disbursed by the bank, and the borrower’s liability to pay the loan, greater. It was not a simple case of deducting from the market valuation whatever amount that has since been disbursed by the bank.

34     I thus arrived at the nett value of the condo as of January 2020 as follows: the market valuation of the property, minus the sum total of the undisbursed loan amount and the outstanding balance amount owing to the bank. The valuation of $870,000 was adopted as the Wife’s figure was more recent and closer to the date of the hearing than the Husband’s. The sum of $344,700 represented the undisbursed loan amount. The Husband produced statements to show that a sum of $235,132.57 was the outstanding balance owed by the Husband to the bank, as the sum of $255,300.00 has already been disbursed, and the Husband has already repaid $26,764.33 (inclusive of accrued interest on the sum of $255,300). The nett value was $870,000 – $344,700 - $235,132.57 = $290,167.73.

### The Husband’s motorcycles

35     At a hearing in February 2020, the Husband claimed that he had sold off his Harley Davidson Forester motorcycle. The case of _TNK v TNL_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 15</span> is clear that parties are not supposed to dispose of their assets when divorce proceedings are afoot, unless consent has been given to do so. As of the date of IJ, it was still part of the pool and if it had indeed been sold, its sale proceeds ought to be ploughed back into the asset pool.

36     The Husband proposed a valuation of $10,000 as of June 2018; I adopted the Wife’s of $10,105.00 which was the open market value of such a vehicle.

37     For another motorcycle which was still in the Husband’s possession, he valued it at $500 whilst the Wife valued it at $1,000. Neither provided any supporting evidence for their valuation and I decided to give the Husband the benefit of the doubt given that the valuation of his Harley Davidson motorcycle was not too far off from the Wife’s.

## Parties’ contributions towards the marriage

38     Parties had different financial contributions towards their real properties, and I found it appropriate to use the classification methodology rather than the global assessment methodology in assessing parties’ contributions (see _TNC v TND_ \[2016\] SGCHF 9) (“_TNC v TND_”).

### Direct contributions towards the current matrimonial flat

39     Parties agreed on the valuation of the fully paid up matrimonial flat of $462,500. Their respective CPF contributions were also undisputed.

40     The table of parties’ joint and personal assets is at **Annex A** and I will not reproduce it here. In sum, I found parties’ direct financial (“DFC”) contributions were as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="37.78%"> <col width="29.18%"> <col width="33.04%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Wife</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Husband</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DFC towards the flat</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">70,762.50 (15.7% of valuation</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">389,887.50 (84.3% of valuation)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DFC towards <em>known</em> asset pool (but excluding the condo)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1,047,233</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">939,068.15</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Total financial contributions</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1,117,995.50</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1,328,955.65</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Total contributions from parties</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>2,446,951.15</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Respective proportion</p></td><td align="left" class="" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>46% to the Wife</b> vs <b>54% to the Husband</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

41     The value of the total asset pool (excluding the condo) was $2,452,720.42.

### Direct contributions towards the condo

42     Ms Lim submitted that the Wife had contributed financially towards the purchase of the condo, and 50% of the monies paid in cash for the condo should be attributed towards her.

43     However, it was unclear on the face of the documentary evidence provided by the parties as to what the Wife’s precise financial contributions were to the condo. I accepted the Husband’s evidence that he had paid up the principal amount from his CPF and he had been paying towards the instalments by cash from his personal bank account. In contrast, there was no evidence supporting the Wife’s claim that she had paid $19,150 towards the condo. In the premises, I did not think it just to simply apportion 50% of the cash paid up for the condo to the Wife. Consequently, I found parties’ DFC towards the condo as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="33.54%"> <col width="31.22%"> <col width="35.24%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Wife</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Husband</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DFC</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">0%</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">100%</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

### Indirect contributions of the parties (“IDC”)

44     In terms of his contributions, the Husband spoke of how he had made great sacrifices for the family by furthering his career and providing for them. He had paid the premiums for the Wife’s and family’s insurance policies and was responsible for paying the outgoings of the household too. It was through his financial contributions that the Wife managed to amass assets in her own name without liabilities. All liabilities were taken on by the Husband as a form of financial planning for the family.

45     Even the condo was bought for the Wife as she fell in love with it. Due to balloting issues, it could only be registered in the Husband’s name.

46     The Husband pointed towards inter-bank transfers and debits made by the Wife from his OCBC personal bank account, in 2015, 2016 and 2017. He contended that his contributions towards this account would have surpassed the Wife’s and disagreed that the Wife had paid for the family expenses. Ms Lim submitted that the Wife was simply managing the family’s finances which the Husband acknowledged was her role, and he was grateful for. But while he accepted that Wife may have made payments from her personal account, this was done merely out of convenience and he suggested she had actually withdrawn monies from his personal OCBC account to meet such expenditure.

47     As for caring for the family, he had done his part by teaching his sons life lessons, coaching them in sports, making memories from their holidays, and ferrying them to and from their tuition classes. He would have to play the ‘bad cop’ by being the disciplinarian whereas the Wife was the ‘good cop’.

48     The Wife disputed that the condo was bought for her. Rather it was bought simply as an investment and retirement home, and was not solely for her. And while she had managed the family’s finances, she insisted she was not aware of the Husband’s many bank accounts disclosed in the proceedings.

49     The Wife also acknowledged the Husband’s payments of the insurance policies but suggested that these payments were made from the Husband’s personal OCBC account which comprised their joint savings (from the Joint Account) and it had been the plan anyway, for their pooled monies to be used in this manner.

50     As for her non-financial contributions, the Wife spoke of how she had cared for the children without a confinement nanny. Instead, she relied on family support in the form of staying at her mother’s place when the Husband was overseas whilst still in the civil service, and she would pay the Husband’s sister to care for her child while she was at work. While she accepted that the Husband did pitch in when he was around, he was frequently travelling by then, and hardly around for the children. She went through post-natal depression and a fussy baby pretty much on her own.

51     The Wife had joined the civil service at 18 years of age, but throughout the years, her career had remained stagnant so that her Husband’s could thrive, and her promotions were delayed because she had to care for the family. She summed it up as such: after he left the civil service, the Husband was preoccupied with his career. From 2014 onwards, he was focused on his affair.

52     Jake and his elder brother also deposed affidavits to set the record straight on their father. Both 23 and 26 at the material time of the filing, they described their distant and fractured relationship with the Husband who was hardly around. In the times they got to spend with him on special occasions or family dinners, he would often belittle and use demeaning words on them such as “useless” and “stupid”. To top it off, he was a harsh disciplinarian who used planks and belts on them to punish and wake them early in the morning. They portrayed the Husband to be an overbearing, irascible and condescending man who was unapproachable due to his temper. Hence, it was the mother whom they turned to for all their problems. And it was out of fear of the father flying into a rage, that they grudgingly accepted the mistress into the family.

53     As for the family’s finances, the sons claimed to have seen the mother pay for everything in the household, and even when they went out as a family. They would also have to speak to their mother first for purchases they wanted, before approaching the Husband when he was in a good mood. After securing his approval, it would be the mother paying for the items.

54     The Wife submitted that 85% be accorded to her for her indirect contributions towards the marriage whilst the Husband submitted 70%.

55     I found that parties never drew bright lines as to their respective contributions. In the early years, before the children came along, both parties contributed towards the Joint Account almost equally, and out of this account many payments were made for their joint lives together, such as the renovations for their first home, the Husband’s MBA degree and his motorcycle purchase.

56     The difference in contributions became starker when the children were born and the Wife had to manage on her own with the Husband heading overseas for his work assignments and spending time outside studying for his MBA. It will be recalled that he took 10 years to complete the course, during which time he was also often overseas because of his job.

57     While the Wife acknowledged that the Husband would help out when he returned from his travels in the earlier years, this would certainly pale in comparison to the amount of her care giving. She was a working mother and would have to oversee the childcare arrangements while the Husband was often away for work. Her job as a technician was by no means a walk in the park and she spoke of rising at dawn and returning past evening. While the Husband grew increasingly successful as a sales director earning $10,000 a month, the Wife found herself somewhat stagnant in her career. When he was retrenched and struggling to get clients, the family had to rely solely on the Wife’s income.

58     The children’s evidence which there was no reason to doubt, made it abundantly clear that they did not ever have a close relationship with the Husband which may have been attributed to his absence from the family home. In fact, in his 1st AOM, he listed one of his indirect contributions as teaching them “life repent/chance lessons” whereby he described two incidents that resulted in him lecturing his sons for their misbehaviour instead of punishing them. It is notable that these life lessons stand out for the Husband but he gave no details or specifics on the “good memories from \[their\] family holidays” or other things he claimed to have done with the children.

59     This was a marriage which experienced its hills and troughs, and parties had weathered life’s storms together from retrenchment to infidelity. Parties had amassed their wealth together, through the Wife’s efforts in caring for the family and attending to the children’s needs financially and non-financially; the Husband by focusing on upgrading himself and switching careers. In contrast, the wife was wedded to her job as a technician in the civil service. The Wife had a stabilising role in the family - she was the one around for the boys and raising them. This allowed the Husband to undertake overseas assignments particularly when he was a sales director, while her progress in the civil service was compromised. As the years went by, ambition and financial gain became his priority it seems and unfortunately, as seen from both sons’ affidavits, they are estranged from their father. Nonetheless, it cannot be denied that the family reaped material benefits from the Husband’s increased earning capacity, and he was also responsible for the making and payment of, the investment decisions in the family.

60     In the Court of Appeal case of _UYP v UYQ_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 3</span>, it stated at \[2\] that

> …it is “an impossible exercise” to attempt to take _every detailed record_ of the marriage into account – all the more so where long marriages are concerned. Indeed, the nature of a marriage stands in stark contrast to a cold commercial relationship, where parties generally keep a close and calculative eye on each other. Attempting to dredge up every record is futile because human memory is fallible, and also constitutes an exercise in obfuscation, when viewed against the tendency for parties to try to locate every detail in _their_ favour in the aftermath of a marriage breakdown.

> \[emphasis in original\]

61     It went on to cite its decision at \[25\] of _ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span> (“_ANJ v ANK_”) that:

> … The broad brush is in no way replaced as we recognise all too clearly that in any marriage many things are done unrecorded – out of love, concern and responsibility – and not with the view to building up a case in the event the marriage fails. It would be a sad day for the institution of marriage if parties were to enter into a marriage with a mental outlook of tracking their contributions towards the marriage”.

62     At the end of the day, broad strokes are to be applied in the realm of indirect contributions, and in the present case, I found 62:38 to the Wife.

## Division of the pool

63     For the indirect contributions, the proportion remains the same across both properties as it is assessed only at the end of the marriage (see _TNC v TND_). The division is thus as follows based on the structured approach in _ANJ v ANK_:

I saw no reason to adjust these ratios.

### Wife’s prayer for uplift due to adverse inference

64     Ms Lim urged the Court to award a 5% uplift to the Wife to give effect to an adverse inference against the Husband for failing to disclose the full extent of his insurance policies and other investments.

65     The law is clear that an adverse inference may be drawn only where:

> (a)     there is a substratum of evidence that establishes a _prima facie_ case against the person against whom the inference is to be drawn; and

> (b)     that person must have had some access to the information he is said to be hiding.

> (see _BPC v BPB and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 1 SLR 608</span> at \[60\]).

66     Mere suspicion is not enough to ground an adverse inference: _BOR v BOS and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGCA 78</span> at \[75\]. Belated disclosures alone are also insufficient, because “parties to a functioning marriage do not keep records of their transactions with a view to building a case should a divorce occur” (see _TXW v TXX_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 799</span> at \[46\]).

67     Here, there were two classes of assets that stood out: the undisclosed Manulife polices and OANDA Asia investments.

68     In the supplementary affidavit that the Husband was given leave to file, he exhibited OCBC bank statements for the years 2015-2017 with numerous handwritten annotations. There were 7 Manulife policies for which premiums were being deducted from his OCBC account as of 2017, but only three were disclosed by the Husband in the proceedings. Manulife had also responded that there were no new policies taken up, or existing policies surrendered after 2014. The logical conclusion is that the Husband had Manulife policies commencing prior to 2014 for which he was still paying the premiums for. He was at liberty to obtain the necessary information from the insurance companies in order to fulfil his disclosure obligations which he did not do so. Hence, I drew an adverse inference against him. Even if the Wife may have limited her queries to a timeframe, the duty of full and frank disclosure is a continuing one and not contingent on an act or omission by a party in seeking further discovery. As the Court of Appeal expressed at \[46\] of _USA v USB_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 57</span>:

> The duty of full and frank disclosure exists independently of applications for discovery and, especially in the context of matrimonial disputes, parties do not need an added incentive to apply for orders against one another.

69     As for the “OANDA Asia” investments, the Husband’s bank statements reflected deposits that came up to some $28,000 and which were made shortly prior to the divorce being filed in January 2018. These investments were neither explained nor accounted for, and only uncovered during the hearing. The Husband clearly had access to such information to these investments and I similarly drew an adverse inference in relation to these investments.

70     Globally, I awarded an uplift of 1% for of the asset pool that excludes the condo and the final division was 55% to the Wife and 45% to the Husband for the asset pool excluding the condo. For the condo, the division was 31% to the Wife and 69% to the Husband.

71     The final 45:55 division for the bulk of the assets, incidentally, inclines towards an equal division which is consistent with the trends observed by the learned Debbie Ong J in _UBM v UBN_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHCF 13</span> at \[66\] that:

> If in long, Single-Income Marriages, the precedent cases show that our courts inclined towards an equal division of the matrimonial assets, there is little reason not to also incline towards equality in long Dual-Income Marriages, in the light of the philosophy of marriage as an equal partnership. _My observation is that trends in cases of long marriages with children, whether Single-Income or Dual-Income ones, also incline towards equal division_. Inclining towards equal division still allows the court to use its discretion to deviate from an exactly 50:50 split and does not constrain the court's discretion, yet upholds the character of marriage and provides guidance to the court.

> \[emphasis added\]

72     I ordered for parties to work out the consequential orders to implement the division in view of the many insurance policies parties had between themselves, and the condo that was about to obtain its TOP.

## Spousal maintenance

73     The Wife sought spousal maintenance, citing her age at 57 years old and the prospect of compulsory retirement in two years’ time. Given her share of the assets, I did not think there was a need for her to be maintained. Further, she is able bodied and has a secure job in civil service.

## Maintenance for Jake

74     By the time of the hearing, the Wife had already paid the sum of $7,490 towards Jake’s school fees at a tertiary institution; the total course fee came up to $22,470. She had also allegedly spent $1,150 per month as Jake’s maintenance from the time she left the matrimonial flat, and sought for the Husband to bear his half share.

75     The Husband agreed to bear a 47.7% share of Jake’s school fees provided it was a local institution. He derived this proportion was based on parties’ respective incomes. The Wife proposed the Husband pay two-thirds of the school fees as his earning capacity of $10,000 was twice of hers.

76     Maintenance is both parents’ duty and responsibility. I was of the view that the Husband ought to pay 50% of Jake’s school fees. There was no indication of financial inability on his part even as he claimed he was getting on in years and did not have a stable job in the government like the Wife. The Husband however refused to pay for an overseas exchange programme Jake had undertaken as he had not been consulted on it.

77     In _UHA v UHB_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHCF 12</span>, the High Court pointed out that in considering the reasonableness of expenses, the reasonable communication of such expenses to the payer, ought to be factored in, particularly where such expenses are extraordinary expenses. Given the Husband’s evidence in his 1st AOM that both his sons have not been speaking to him since December 2017, I found that the Husband was indeed not consulted on Jake’s overseas internship.

78     Further, in _UYT v UYU \[_2020\] SGHCF 8, the High Court observed that “Section 69 WC is not intended to be used by a child after he has reached adult status and is independent.” Jake is now 23 years old. In the aforesaid case, the High Court stated that a parent’s duty to maintain a child was not the same as that parent having to pay for all expenses of a child’s education. I thus declined to order that the Husband pays towards Jake’s expenses for the exchange programme.

79     As for Jake’s backdated maintenance, the Wife’s breakdown was as follows:

> (a)     Mobile phone: $80

> (b)     Allowance: $800

> (c)     Transport: $120

> (d)     Food (for lunch): $100

> (e)     School materials: $50

80     I ordered that the Husband pay his half share of standard, essential items such as Jake’s mobile phone ($40); transport ($60), and lunch ($50). I found that the allowance ought to be pared down to something more reasonable of $400 per month, and hence the Husband’s half share would be $200. If the Wife was desirous of affording Jake a generous allowance, this was at her own discretion and the Husband ought not to contribute towards it. The Husband’s share came up to $350 per month for January 2018 to July 2019, totalling $6,650.

## Costs

81     Ms Lim submitted for costs to be decided by the Court owing to the numerous requests for documents and discovery orders which the Husband failed to comply with.

82     Given the drip-feed manner in which the evidence came in and the delays caused to the ancillary matters hearing, I awarded costs of $2,000 all in to be paid by the Husband to the Wife.
