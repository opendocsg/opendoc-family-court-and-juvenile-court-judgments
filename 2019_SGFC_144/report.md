Family Law – Variation of Care and Control – Public Holidays

18 December 2019

### District Judge Kenneth Yap:

## Introduction

1       This is an appeal against a variation order made in relation to care of the children of the marriage over the New Year and the eve of Chinese New Year (“CNY”) holidays.

2       The Parties in this case were married on 10 January 1987. The marriage lasted for some 25 years. There are three surviving children to the marriage. The Plaintiff (“Mother”) commenced divorce proceedings against the Defendant (“Father”) on 17 May 2012, citing the ground of unreasonable behaviour. The Father did not contest and parties entered into a Settlement Deed on 23 April 2012, which was recorded in the terms of the Interim Judgment granted on 25 June 2012. Final Judgment was issued on 28 September 2012. The Father, aged 56, is a businessman and a non-executive director of a public listed company, while the Mother, aged 56, is a home maker.

3       The children to the marriage (“the Children”) comprise:

> a)     C1 (male), born in 1996, now passed away;

> b)     C2 (female), born in 1998. She was 21 years of age at the date of the hearing, and has been studying in Australia since 2016;

> c)     C3 (female), born in 1999. She was 20 years of age at the date of the hearing, and has been studying in Ireland since 2018; and

> d)     C4 (male), born in 2007. He was 11 years of age at the date of the hearing, and was attending school as a Primary 6 student. He resides in Singapore.

4       Under the terms of the Settlement Deed, joint custody was awarded to both parents. The Father would have care and control of the Children during specified periods, namely over the entire weekend during school terms, as well as the entirety of the Children’s school holidays at the end of the last term of each school year (“the December Holidays”). He would also have care of the Children when the Mother was not in Singapore. Apart from these periods, the Mother had default care and control over the children for the remainder of the time.

5       Over the years since the divorce in 2012, the Parties were able to work out care and control arrangements on a goodwill basis for special occasions not expressly covered by the Settlement Deed, which included New Year’s Day, Chinese New Year, Mother’s and Father’s Days, and the Parties’ respective birthdays[^1]. The relationship however started breaking down in 2019. According to the Mother, this was due to her service of a statutory demand on the Father on 7 December 2018, and the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings in HC/B XX of 2019[^2] on 26 February 2019 against the Father. Under these proceedings, she claimed that he had only paid her S$20 million of the S$60 million he was obliged to pay to her under the Deed of Settlement filed with the Interim Judgment. By the Mother’s account, the financial dispute was behind the denials of her requests for access, one specific incident of which was the denial of access to her over the Mother’s Day weekend in 2019[^3]. The Father however denies this, and claims that the breakdown in the relationship started when the Mother first frustrated the care arrangements over the eve of Chinese New Year on 4 February 2019 by depriving the Children of their yearly tradition of attending his extended family’s reunion dinner on Chinese New Year eve.

## The Summonses for Variation

6       Both parties had filed summonses to vary the Interim Judgment. The Mother’s application was made on 6 May 2019 _vide_ SUM XXX/2019, while the Father’s was made on 14 June 2019 _vide_ SUM XXX/2019.

7       The summonses sought variation on ten issues in relation to access to the children. By the time of the hearing, the parties had agreed on two of the issues, and decision was rendered on the remaining eight issues at the conclusion of the hearing on 3 September 2019.

8       The Parties have appealed only in relation to two of the eight issues decided at the hearing (the Mother has appealed _vide_ HCF/DCA 115/2019 and the Defendant has cross-appealed _vide_ HCF/DCA 116/2019).

9       The first issue relates to when the Father has to return the children at the end of the December holidays, for which there is no specific definition in the Settlement Deed. To appreciate the context of this issue, the care arrangements under the Interim Judgment that are applicable where both Parties reside in Singapore are reproduced for convenient reference:

> 1.3    The Husband is to have care and control of the Children for at least the following periods:

> 1.3.1 From 6 pm on Friday to 9 pm on Sunday each week during school terms, regardless of whether Monday is a public holiday or a school holiday during a school term;

> 1.3.2 In the event that Friday is a public holiday or a school holiday during a school term, from 10 pm on Thursday to 9 pm on Sunday;

> 1.3.3 The Children’s school holidays at the end of the last term of each school year (the “December Holidays”);

> 1.3.4 Subject to paragraph 1.7 below, whenever the Wife is not in Singapore.

> 1.4    The Wife is to have care and control of the Children for the rest of the time.

10     Following the hearing, I directed that the Father was to return the children to the Mother after his care during the December holidays by 10 am on 1 January. To effect this, Paragraph 1.3.3 of the ancillary matters orders was varied as follows:

> “1.3.3. The Children’s school holidays at the end of the last term of each school year (the “December Holidays”), with the Children to be returned to the Wife by no later than 10am on 1 January; and” \[_Emphasis added_\]

11     The second issue for which the parties have appealed relates to access during the eve of the Chinese New Year holidays. Apart from the provision for public holidays falling on Fridays and Mondays, the treatment of which was specified in Clause 1.3.1 and 1.3.2 of the Settlement Deed above, no mention was made of the treatment of the Chinese New Year holidays.

12     Following the hearing, I directed that the Parties should split access on the eve of Chinese New Year, with the Mother having access to the Children from 3 pm to 8.30 pm, and the Father having access thereafter. There was no issue as to the actual days of CNY, as parties were agreed that the first day should be spent with the Father and the second day with the Mother. To effect this, a fresh paragraph 1.4.1 was inserted after paragraph 1.4 of the Settlement Deed in the following terms:

> 1.4.1. The Wife shall have care of the Children from 3pm on the eve of Chinese New Year to 8.30pm on the eve of Chinese New Year while the Husband shall have care of the Children thereafter to 10am on the second day of Chinese New Year, after which the Wife will have care of the Children for the remainder of that day. For avoidance of doubt, the Children are to be delivered by the Wife to the Husband at his residence at 8.30pm on the eve of Chinese New Year.

13     For completeness, and to provide the proper context, I set out the remaining eight issues of access which were decided at or settled prior to the hearing, and are not the subject matter of the Parties’ appeals. It will be self-evident from the table below that the disputes were over specific dates and occasions, and did not seek to disturb the overall structure of care and control envisaged in the Deed of Settlement.

## Applicable Legal Principles

14     The power to order a variation of custody is provided for in s 128 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353):

> 128.  The court may at any time vary or rescind any order for the custody, or the care and control, of a child on the application of any interested person, where it is satisfied that the order was based on any misrepresentation or mistake of fact or where there has been any material change of circumstances.

15     In this case, as both parties sought variation of the terms of the Interim Judgment, it was not disputed that there had been a material change of circumstances sufficient to raise the issues in dispute for consideration by the court. It was common ground that the previous amicable manner in which the parties had cooperated to sort out care arrangements had broken down of late[^21]. While the Parties had proffered different reasons for this breakdown, it was indisputable that it would be in the best interest of the Children to clarify the details on the care arrangements in order to avoid further dispute.

16     In assessing whether and how to vary a custody order under s 128 of the Women’s Charter, the paramount consideration is the welfare of the child[^22]. This is made explicit in s 125(2) of the Women’s Charter:

> 125(2)    In deciding in whose custody, or in whose care and control, a child should be placed, the paramount consideration shall be the welfare of the child and subject to this, the court shall have regard –

>> (a)    to the wishes of the parents of the child; and

>> (b)    to the wishes of the child, where he or she is of an age to express an independent opinion.

17     What constitutes the welfare of the child must be taken in a broad sense, and should maintain the ties of affection that the child enjoys, per the High Court in _ABW v ABV_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 769</span> at \[22\] to \[24\]:

> 22    The fundamental question that a court asks itself when making a decision affecting a child is whether that decision will promote the welfare of the child. The concept of “welfare” is not a narrow one: it has to be considered in the widest sense and is not to be measured by money or physical comfort only. The child’s moral and religious well-being must be taken into account and his relationships with his siblings and other relatives. It is important to maintain the ties of affection the child enjoys. (see _Soon Peck Wah v Woon Che Chye_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 3 SLR(R) 430</span>).

> 23    The decision as to what is in the best interests of any particular child depends on the circumstances of the individual case and the individual child. However, this does not mean that that decision is a subjective one for the judge hearing the case. Rather, a number of relevant circumstances should be taken into account when arriving at a decision. The stability factor is but one such circumstance. Others include:

>> (a)    the need for both parents to have an involvement in the child’s life;

>> (b)    which parent shows the greater concern for the child;

>> (c)    the maternal bond;

>> (d)    the child’s wishes; and

>> (e)    the desirability of keeping siblings together.

> 24    The degree to which any one factor or the other is to be given pre-eminence is not fixed but depends entirely on the facts of each case. Here, the mother stressed the need for both parents to have an involvement in the children’s lives. She emphasised that the strength of the maternal–child bond should not be weakened or destroyed.

18     It is axiomatic that the best interests of the child lie in maintaining and indeed maximising the involvement of both parents in the lives of the child. For this reason, in applying the principle of best interest to the question of care over public holidays, the Courts have generally favoured equal treatment of both parents as far as reasonably practicable. While such orders are generally commonplace, I cite two written decisions which implemented division of public holiday access on equal terms for reference:

>> a)    In _TAT v TAU_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGFC 48</span>, one parent was Christian and the other was Muslim, and had earlier been granted orders for care of the child over the Christmas/Good Friday and Hari Raya holidays in accordance with the parents’ respective faiths. In a subsequent application for variation of the custody orders, the Court directed that the child should spend the eve of each of the two public holidays with the parent who practised the religion, to better enable to child to be exposed to both religions and to understand and appreciate the religious practices of both parents (at \[52\]).

>> b)    In _UYJ v UYK_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGFC 76</span>, both parents were of the Jewish faith. The Court granted an interim order that for Jewish holidays that spanned more than one day, care was to be equally shared between the parties, whereas for other Jewish holidays that lasted for a day, they were to be shared on an alternate basis (at \[31\]).

19     Bearing the above legal principles in mind, I turn now to their application in the present case.

## Reasons for the Variation Orders

#### The December Holiday Handover

20     Under the Settlement Deed, the Father has care of the Children over the entirety of the December holidays. The dispute relates only to who should have the care of the Children over New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day. The Mother’s position was that the Children should be handed over to her by 9 pm on 31 December, while the Father’s position was that the handover should be by 9 pm on 1 January.

21     The Mother’s position was premised on her view that the last day of the December school holiday should be 31 December 2018, as confirmed by the Ministry of Education’s calendar[^23]. She also explained that it would be in C4’s best interest to spend the whole of 1 January settling in for school at her home, to pack his school bag and supplies, and to ease him into the start of the school year. She also pointed out that the only time that the Father had spent New Year’s Eve with C4 was in 2014 and 2018, and that there was therefore no consistent practice of him having care of C4 over the turn of the year.

22     The Father on the other hand claims that the status quo has been that the Children have spent every New Year eve to New Year with him since the divorce[^24], with the only exception being in 2016, when the Parties swapped school holidays, and accordingly swapped the New Year arrangements. He explained that the annual New Year celebrations with the Children were important to him, and that he had taken great effort to prepare extravagant celebrations with the Children for the past seven years. This included taking them overseas, organising New Year parties or bringing them to lavish restaurants. The Father explained that C4 did not attend the New Year celebrations with himself and the Daughters in 2015 and 2017 because he was underage in relation to the chosen venues. As regards the Mother’s argument that C4 should return home on 31 Dec to avoid being tired at the opening of the school year, the Father noted that C4 was never tired out when he returned to the Mother every Sunday at 9 pm during the school weeks[^25], and that there should therefore be no cause of concern as the first day of school is usually the least demanding, with no outstanding homework or lessons to recap.

23     I found merit in the Mother’s contention that a reasonable time is needed for a child to settle down before the start of the school year on 2 January. Some peace and quiet is useful to allow the child to transition from the six week holiday break and gear up for the start of a new school term. This is especially so where the child had been in the care of the Father for the entirety of the December Holiday, and not with the Mother who is his primary caregiver for the school term. On the other hand, I accepted that the Father did have a genuine and well-meaning intent of celebrating New Year’s Eve with his Children, and was desirous of C4 joining him and the Daughters now that C4 was older. The New Year holiday would also be significant to him as it would be a fitting end to his annual period of extended care of the Children during the December Holidays, before he returned them to the Mother’s care for the school term. On balance, I was of the view that both objectives could be met with a measure of compromise. If the Father returned C4 to the Mother at 10 am on the morning of New Year’s Day, C4 would have the opportunity to celebrate the turn of the year with his Father and sisters, and yet be afforded an entire day to acclimatise to the start of the school term. I noted that as C4 would be entering secondary school from 2020, his need for preparatory time would conceivably be lesser than when he was in primary school. Accordingly, a handover at 10 am on 1 January was most optimal as it would allow him to maximise his time with both parents over the New Year, and balance the objectives of work and play as he transited from the holidays to the start of the school term.

#### The Eve of Chinese New Year

24     The Parties were both _ad idem_ that the first day of the CNY holiday would be spent with the Father, while the second day would be spent with the Mother. The dispute lay in who would have care of the Children on the eve of CNY, with the corresponding privilege of having the children attend their respective reunion dinners. The Father’s position was that he should have care of the Children on every eve of CNY, from 5 pm until 9 am on the morning of the second day of CNY. The Mother’s position is that the parties should alternate care of the Children on the eve of CNY. On even years, she sought to have care of the Children from 6 pm on the eve of CNY until 10 am on the first day of CNY, and on odd years, the Father would have care of the Children from 6pm on the eve of CNY until 10 am on the second day of CNY.

25     It is not disputed that the Father had a reunion dinner at his home with his extended family every year[^26], and that the Children had over the years always attended at his home on the eve of the CNY, with the exception of 2019, when they were sent to the Father’s home at only around 10 pm[^27]. Counsel for the Father cited _ABW v ABV_ at \[22\], submitting that the Court should give weight to the Children’s relationship with his siblings and other relatives, and thereby maintain the ties of affection enjoyed with his extended family. This had become even more important as the Daughters now live overseas, and occasions to interact with the Father’s extended family had become comparatively rare. The Father believed that the Mother’s extended family did not have a tradition of holding a reunion dinner, as some of her extended family were Malaysian and were not all are present during the eve of CNY. He also took the view that if the reunion was between the Mother (who was not working) and the Children only, she could do so over lunchtime with the Children on the eve of CNY, or dine with them anytime on the second day of CNY.

26     In support of his contention, counsel for the Father cited a similar arrangement directed by the Court in _TJT v TJU_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGFC 166</span> where the District Judge noted at \[25\]:

> As for Chinese New Year, I note from the parties’ representations to me during the hearing that the family typically has reunion lunch with the maternal relatives and reunion dinner with the paternal relatives on Chinese New Year Eve and I thus ordered accordingly with the cut-off time at 4pm. As for Chinese New Year 1st and 2nd day, I ordered for these two festive days to be alternated between the two parties.

27     The Mother’s contention was that she wished to spend more quality time with her children during CNY, for the same reason that her Daughters had been studying overseas since 2016 and 2018 respectively. She felt that the fairest order which would promote the best interests of the Children would be to alternate arrangements for the CNY eve, and to maintain the present standing arrangement where the first day is spent with the Father, while the second day is spent with the Mother.

28     While it is true that there had thus far been no tradition of the Mother having the Children over for an extended family reunion dinner, that to my mind should not preclude her from expressing a genuine desire of sharing this culturally significant and symbolic meal with her Children, even if it was only within the context of her nuclear family unit. On the other hand, it was also perfectly understandable that the Father, being accustomed to having his Children attend his extended family dinner, should wish to have them continue that tradition, especially since he had lesser interaction with the Children, since the Mother is the primary caregiver for C4 and the Daughters are studying overseas. The cultural significance of the reunion dinner, and the implications to family pride and tribal allegiance that is symbolised in such a gathering, cannot be overstated in a traditional Chinese household. The question is whether parity between the two families is best achieved by alternating or sharing access to the Children over the occasion.

29     In this regard, I took the pragmatic view that a reunion is made complete in its gathering, and not in the act of feasting. What is important is that the Children are able to attend the respective dinners and celebrate the occasion with both their Mother as well as their Father’s extended family each and every year. With some measure of compromise, I do believe this objective can be achieved. As I was informed during the hearing that both Parties do not live far apart, and that vehicular transit between the two homes would not present any impediment, the Children could conceivably have an earlier dinner with their Mother, before joining the dinner at their Father’s home at 8.30 pm. This is not an uncommon practice, even in families that remain undivided. It is simply a question of exercising forebearance and employing a mindset of give-and-take, all for the sake of the greater good. Accordingly, I directed that the Mother should have care of the Children from 3 pm to 8.30 pm on every eve of CNY, and that the Children are to be delivered to the Father at his residence by 8.30 pm.

## Conclusion

30     Over more than two decades of marriage and seven years of divorce, the Parties in this case have been able to co-manage the care of their Children, until events in 2019 led to a derailment of their efforts. While differences over money and pride may loom large in the minds of the Parties, they should remember that there are no winners where the Children are caught in the centre of parental acrimony. What is heartening in this case is that both parents are sincerely invested in sharing with and building their lives around the Children. It would seem penny-wise, pound-foolish, to then sour the parental relationship over minor disputes of care and control, or to allow for the insidious transference of resentment over financial matters to sully the bond between parents and children. Money, after all, is ephemeral, whereas the love and gratitude of children is eternal.

31     At the close of the matter, I heard the Parties on costs. As the Parties were evenly split on the success of their respective applications, I made no order as to costs. It would also be apposite at this point to record my gratitude to both sets of counsel for their invaluable assistance in the conduct of this matter.
