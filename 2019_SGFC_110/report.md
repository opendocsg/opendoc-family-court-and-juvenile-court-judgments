Ancillary Matters on Child Access and Child Maintenance

8 October 2019

### District Judge Toh Wee San:

### Introduction

1       This is an appeal by the plaintiff wife (“W”) against my ancillary orders resulting from her divorce application.

### Background

2       Parties were both 53 years old and they have two children aged about 21 and 17 years old when the case came before me. The defendant husband (“H”) was a physiotherapist and operated a business providing such services. W was a homemaker at times during the marriage while helping H with his business. At the point of hearing, H earned an average of S$21,634 per month while W had a full time job and earned an average of S$3,568 per month. W filed for divorce in July 2017 on the ground of H’s adultery and interim judgement was granted in January 2018 on that ground, ending a 26-year marriage. Parties could not agree on their ancillary matters. After hearing both sides, I gave my ancillary matter order (“AMO”) in June 2019. W appealed against parts of the AMO concerning the child’s issues. She appealed against H being the care parent, her weekend access to and monthly maintenance for the child. I attach a copy of the AMO and explain my decision below.

### Issue 1: Care duties over the child

3       As the older child was above 21 years old, I declined to rule on his care and maintenance. I opined that I only had to rule on the custody and care duties over the second child (“the child”). Both parents also agreed on joint custody over the child. However, both wanted to be the care parent to the child.

4       W’s case was that she was more suited to be the care parent as she was a dedicated wife and loving mother to the child. On the other hand H had sowed discord between the child and her including bribing the child with holidays, outings and poisoning the child’s mind with half–truths. W was concerned that the child was influenced by H’s questionable moral values. She hoped that the child would one day comprehend the lengths she had gone through to be a good mother to him, even allowing herself to be painted in a bad light by H and becoming the disciplinarian when any alleged screaming and shouting were in fact part of disciplining the child. W also submitted that H portrayed an entirely different image in-front of the child and dragged the child into the divorce by getting the child to write a letter to indicate that he wanted to stay with H.

5       H’s case was that he was more suited to be the care parent and W can have liberal access to the child, subject to the child’s wishes. H submitted that the he had a close bond with the child who was more relaxed and happier with him. On the other hand, the child had a turbulent relationship with W. In essence, H submitted that the child was old enough to decide whom he was more comfortable with and the child had chosen H, as evidenced by his written note. H disagreed that he was a poor example just because the marriage was dissolved on the ground of his adultery. H also highlighted that the child had a clash with W in their recent overseas holiday. Thereafter the child refused to share a room with W.

6       I applied the relevant laws[^1] and interviewed the child. In conclusion, I ruled that parties shall have joint custody over the child, H shall be the care parent and W shall have reasonable access to the child. As for the school holiday, public holidays and special occasions such as the child’s birthday, I ordered parties to have equal access to the child. All these access were to be carried out in consult with the child. Considering the totality of the evidence before me and the child interview, I was persuaded that this would be the most appropriate arrangement. The child was already 17 years old and had expressed his own opinion on the care and access issues. He also started a new phase of his life this year by commencing his studies in a Polytechnic. I opined that it would be in the child’s best interest to respect his written election and allow him to focus on his new schooling life while transiting to the post-divorce family situation. How-ever I also provided for a baseline position in respect of the weekly and holiday access for W, in case no agreement can be reached. I ordered that W should have weekly weekend access including overnight and yearly access to the child on certain days over the Chinese New Year holidays.

### Issue 2: Monthly maintenance for the child

7       W’s case was that H should be the sole parent maintaining the child in view of his way bigger earning capacity. W estimated the child’s monthly expenses to be about S$1,000.

8       H’s case was both parents had an equal duty to maintain the child. The child’s expenses should be apportioned between the parties, regardless of which parent gets care and control. Although H earned substantially more than W, he argued that he had less cash than W as his income was used towards the family and acquisition of the properties. He also expected an increasing expenditure in view of his age and need to support his aged father. H also pointed out that after the matrimonial property was sold, both sides will have substantial cash from the sale. In addition, H pointed out that the child was now in Polytechnic with higher tertiary and course material fees of about $6,600 per year.

9       I applied the relevant laws[^2] and ordered W to maintain the child at $300 per month. I was persuaded that maintenance for the child should be co-shared according to each party’s earning capacity, which was about 20% to 80% for W to H. I accepted W’s rough estimate of the child’s living expenses though the child was slightly older as compared to the time the expenses were computed as it was within an acceptable range. I also added the tertiary fees and related expenses. This would give an average amount of about S$ 1,500 per month. 20% of this would give us about $300 per month. This figure did not include accommodation and related expenses (such as household expenses) which I had attributed an additional 3% to H’s share when I divided parties’ matrimonial assets. W had not appealed against the divisional outcome. W’s monthly maintenance would be for the child’s other expenses such as his educational and living expenses.

10     As for costs, I ordered each to bear his or her own costs since both did not get what they asked for squarely.
