Guardianship of Infants Act, sections 5 and 3 – Surrogacy – Parent – Custody Order

26 November 2019

### District Judge Yarni Loi:

## Introduction

1       This is an application by a natural biological father (Father) for sole custody of his biological son (Child) who was conceived in India through gestational surrogacy. The identity of the egg donor is unknown and the Child’s birth certificate states that mother is “Mrs. Not Known”. Father is a British citizen and Singapore Permanent Resident. He has a male gay partner (Partner) who is a Singapore Citizen and they work in the creative/design industry in Singapore. They registered their civil union in Scotland in July 2011. In 2012, they entered into a surrogacy agreement with gestational surrogate mother (Surrogate) in India. The Child, a British citizen, was born in April 2013, whereupon Father brought the Child with him to Singapore where he raised the Child with his Partner. The Child will be 7 years old next year and the couple have secured a place for him in an international school. In order for the Child to study in Singapore, Father has to obtain a student pass for him. Over the years, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) has consistently rejected various applications by Father and Partner for Permanent Residency/long-term visit pass/student pass, for the Child. The latest application for a student pass was rejected by the ICA on 3 October 2019.

2       Father, who has shared the Surrogacy Agreement with the ICA, suspects that the reason why ICA has been rejecting the applications is because the birth certificate of the Child does not name a “mother”. In this application, Father has therefore named the Surrogate as the defendant, the presumed “mother”, who has given her “consent” to the application. He believes that such a custody order would improve the Child’s chances of being granted a student pass.

3       Having considered the matter carefully, I will dismiss the application. The law of custody is accessed when there is a genuine need to ensure that arrangements have been made for the upbringing and welfare of a child. The court will not intervene unnecessarily in the parent-child relationship. In this case, there is no hint of a dispute or quarrel with any other caregiver, or with the Surrogate, over the upbringing and welfare of the Child. Further, Father has taken out this application as a “parent” under the Guardianship of Infants Act (GIA) precisely because he is the undisputed natural biological parent of the Child. A custody award will not add to his status as a natural parent who already has actual custody of the Child. It will not change the legitimacy status of the Child. In truth, Father wishes to be armed with a piece of paper – a court order – which, on the face of it, would give the appearance of a typical custody case - where the Child has a father and a mother, with sole custody of the child awarded to the father. He hopes that such a court order will convince the ICA to grant the student pass. However, there is no evidence at all that obtaining such a custody order would improve the Child’s chances of obtaining a student pass. Furthermore, whether or not a student pass ought to be granted to the Child, or to any foreign child/international student who wishes to study in Singapore, is a matter for the ICA. The court’s jurisdiction under the GIA should not be invoked in respect of matters falling under the jurisdiction of the ICA.

## Background facts according to Father’s affidavits

4       Father and Partner met in 2003 and started an exclusive relationship in 2004. On 8 July 2011, they registered their civil partnership in Scotland. Desirous of starting a family and raising their own child, they decided to pursue surrogacy with an agency in India. They paid a total of USD16,976 (SGD 29,046.19 based on 2013 exchange rates) to the agency, of which INR200,000 (SGD4,087.47 equivalent) was payable to the Surrogate.

5       They planned to have two children, and they each fertilised eggs from the same donor. They felt that it would be prudent for the first born to be biologically connected to Father, with the second biologically related to the Partner. As “Scottish law confers parental rights on the biological father of the child, we felt it would be prudent for \[Father\] to go first since we could be assured that at the very least, our first child could be legitimised and obtain British citizenship through his relationship to me. The \[Surrogate\] was thus implanted with the eggs fertilised by \[Father\].”[^1] According to Father, the laws in India changed before they could try for a second child using the embryo fertilised with Partner’s sperm. That embryo remains frozen.

### Surrogacy Agreement

6       On 24 July 2012, Father entered into a Gestational Surrogacy Agreement with the Surrogate (Surrogacy Agreement). The Surrogacy Agreement expressly provides that neither the Surrogate, nor her husband, shall have any physical or legal custody of, or any parental rights or duties with respect to, the child born out of the surrogacy process, with Father possessing exclusive custody of the child and all parental rights and duties from the moment of the child’s birth. Several relevant clauses are set out below:

> Father to possess exclusive parental and custodial rights and duties

> (a)     Clause 2.2 provides that “It is clearly understood and unequivocally agreed and confirmed by the parties that the child that the \[Surrogate\] shall give birth for the intended father through this surrogacy process shall be born out of the embryos of the intended father and shall carry the genes/DNA of the intended father and thus the child shall genetically and biologically belong to the intended father and the \[Surrogate\] **will only lend her uterus** for carrying the pregnancy and giving birth of the child out of humanitarian ground.” \[Emphasis added.\]

> (b)     Clause 4.2 provides that “Upon giving birth to the child, the surrogate motherhood of the \[Surrogate\] shall stand perpetually extinguished and the contractual relationship between the \[Surrogate\] and the child shall stand perpetually severed, disassociated and come to an end.”

> (c)     Clause 4.5 provides that “\[Surrogate\] shall have no right over the child conceived and given birth to, pursuant to this Agreement and that the child so given birth pursuant to this Agreement is genetically, morally and contractually that of the intended father, and the intended father has the sole and exclusive right to bring up the child without any interference by the \[Surrogate\], and without any retention or assertion by her of any parental rights.”

> (d)     Clause 4.6 provides that “It is clearly understood and unequivocally confirmed that neither the \[Surrogate\] nor her husband shall have any physical or legal custody of or any parental rights or duties with respect to the child born out of this surrogacy process and that the intended father shall exclusively have such custody and all parental rights and duties from the moment of the child’s birth.”

> (e)     Paragraph 5 of the affidavit affirmed by Surrogate’s husband confirms that “… I shall at no time attempt to assert any parental rights or seek any kind of custody or visitation with respect to said child and that intended father of the child, shall exclusively have full physical and legal custody and all parental rights.”

> Birth certificate to only bear Father’s name as legal parent

> (f)     Clause 4.13 provides that “**The birth certificate of the child given birth pursuant to this agreement shall only bear the name of the intended father as the legal parent and natural guardian/s of the child. The surrogate mother and/or her husband shall have no say nor shall make any objection whatsoever to the issuing of birth certificate of the child carrying the name of the intended father as the parent of the child**…” \[Emphasis added.\]

> Agreement governed by the laws of India and the courts in Mumbai shall have exclusive jurisdiction to resolve disputes

> (g)     Clause 6.9 provides that “The Courts at Mumbai, India only shall have exclusive jurisdiction in respect of the subject matter of this Agreement and action, suits and proceedings under or arising from this Agreement… This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of India…”

### Child is born and raised in Singapore

7       On 3 April 2013, the Child was born in India and is a British citizen by descent.[^2] On 12 April 2013, the Child’s birth was registered in India. According to Father, under Scottish law, he possesses parental responsibilities and rights as he is named as the “father” in the birth certificate.[^3] Next to the “Name of Mother” in the birth certificate are the words “Mrs. Not Known”.

8       On 29 May 2013, the couple brought the Child back to Singapore to live with them. Father says that in 2013 when the Child was about 6 months old, he and his Partner had applied for Permanent Residency (PR) status for the Child, but were unsuccessful. Father believes that “This application was rejected as we were unable to provide details about his birth mother. Since the egg donor opted to have her details kept private, neither \[Partner\] nor I were ever privy to that information. This was despite the fact that we had shared our surrogacy agreement. We did not appeal the rejection because the ICA did not provide the details for its rejection…”[^4]

9       Meanwhile, on 26 September 2014, the couple enrolled the Child in a pre-school/kindergarten. According to Father, the Child has been enjoying school and has formed many close friendships with his classmates. As the Child turns 7 years of age in 2020, he is due to enrol in formal primary schooling and Father has secured a place for the Child in an international school. Father signed a student contract on 29 April 2019 for the school year 2019/2020 (Student Contract) and the school has agreed to reserve the Child’s placement until the application for student pass is completed.[^5]

10     As the Child is currently on a short-term visit pass (STVP), he leaves and re-enters the country every 3 months to renew the pass.[^6]

### ICA rejects applications for PR status, LTVP and student pass

11     After the first unsuccessful attempt at obtaining PR status for the Child in 2013, Father and/or Partner continued to apply, at various points in time, for either PR status, long-term visit pass (LTVP) or student pass for the Child. The various attempts, including appeals, have all been unsuccessful.[^7] The latest application for a student pass was initiated by the international school on 30 September 2019. By letter dated 3 October 2019, ICA rejected the application.

### Reasons for taking out this application

12     Father and his Partner would like the Child to continue to live and study in Singapore where the Child is doing well and has close family and friends. Singapore is the only home the Child knows. They have provided the Child with a spacious and secure home in Singapore where they both hold good jobs. They are both primary caregivers to the Child and have the assistance of a domestic helper. If needed, the Partner’s sister will help them out. The couple have a strong network of family and friends in Singapore who will be able to provide the Child with guidance and support. The Child is also very close to his two cousins, the daughters of the Partner’s sister.

13     Father says that he has taken out this application for a custody order, as he believes it will assist him in securing a student pass for the Child.[^8] The inability to obtain a student pass affects the Child’s ability to continue to live and study in Singapore and the couple’s capacity to plan for the Child’s future, which is detrimental to the Child’s best interests.[^9] Being on a STVP is not feasible as the Child has to leave and re-enter every 3 months to renew his pass, and there is a risk it may not be renewed.[^10]

## Father’s submissions and arguments

14     Father’s arguments in support of the application changed their shape and focus in the course of counsel’s arguments and submissions. When Father first took out the application, seeking a consent order, he explained that he believes that such an order would be in the Child’s best interests, as it may assist Father in obtaining a Student Pass. He argues that the custody order would create a “legal nexus” between Father and Child.

15     When asked to explain the “legal nexus” that he was seeking to establish, Father’s counsel (counsel) argued that under common law, Father does not have any kind of rights to the Child who would be illegitimate in the eyes of Singapore law because surrogacy is illegal and gay marriages are not recognised, whereas the Surrogate is presumed to be the “mother”. As such, Father needs a custody order to “take over” Surrogate’s parental rights, entitlements and obligations over the Child, vesting the parental rights in Father.

16     In the course of submissions, when it was highlighted that there was no no dispute between Father and Surrogate on any matter regarding the upbringing and welfare of the Child requiring the court’ intervention, the shape of counsel’s argument changed. Counsel argued that as the Surrogacy Agreement is unenforceable, “the sanction of the court is required to make it enforceable”, to “circumscribe parties’ rights and entitlements over the child” in the form of declaratory relief. The Court is empowered to determine whether the arrangements are in the Child’s best interests.

## Issues

17     I will deal with the following issues in turn:

> (a)     Whether the law of custody has been properly accessed by Father, given that there is no genuine dispute over the Child’s upbringing and welfare?

> (b)     In any case, whether the custody order, as sought, will bring any real “value” to Father or the Child?

>> i.       Whether a custody order can operate to transfer parental rights from one parent to another?

>> ii.       Whether the custody order sought would create a “legal nexus” in the sense of “legitimising” the parent-child relationship?

>> iii.       Whether there is evidence that the custody order sought would improve the Child’s chances of obtaining a Student Pass?

> (c)     Whether this application is an improper use of section 5 of the GIA?

>> i.       Whether section 5 should be invoked as a tool to sanction the Surrogacy Agreement?

>> ii.       Whether section 5 should be invoked to influence matters within the purview of the ICA.

## Issue 1 - Whether the law of custody should be accessed when there is no genuine dispute over the Child’s upbringing and welfare?

18     Regardless of whether the court’s powers to make custody orders are accessed under the Women’s Charter or the GIA, these powers should be exercised judiciously in cases where there is a genuine need to ensure that arrangements have been made by the parents or other caregivers for the welfare of a child. No such genuine need arises in this case. Even assuming that the Surrogate is the “presumed” mother (which I have serious doubts about, as I will explain later), there is no dispute at all as regards the upbringing and welfare of the Child between Father and Surrogate for the court to adjudicate, and the application should not even have been made.

### The law on custody

19     For divorce cases, the power of the court to make custody and care and control orders is governed by the following provisions in Chapter 5, Part X, of the Women’s Charter:

> (a)     section 123 provides that the court shall not make final any judgment of divorce unless the court is satisfied that arrangements have been made for the welfare of every child to the marriage and that these arrangements are satisfactory or are the best that can be devised in the circumstances;

> (b)     section 124 provides that the court may, at any stage of the proceedings, make orders with respect to the welfare of the child; and

> (c)     section 125 specifies that in deciding whose custody, or in whose care and control the child should be placed, the paramount consideration shall be the “welfare of the child”.

20     For other types of cases involving the upbringing and welfare of a child, including intra-parental cases where divorce proceedings have not yet been commenced, the GIA provides as follows:

> (a)     Section 5 of the GIA provides that either a parent or a court appointed guardian may take out an application:

>> “5.    The court may, upon the application of **either parent or of any guardian appointed under this Act**, make orders as it may think fit regarding the custody of such infant, the right of access thereto and the payment of any sum towards the maintenance of the infant and may alter, vary or discharge such order on the application of either parent or of any guardian appointed under this Act.”, \[Emphasis added.\]

> (b)     Section 3 of the GIA further provides that the first and paramount consideration shall be the welfare of the child:

>> “3.    Where in any proceedings before any court the custody or upbringing of an infant or the administration of any property belonging to or held in trust for an infant or the application of the income thereof is in question, **the court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration** and save in so far as such welfare otherwise requires the father of an infant shall not be deemed to have any right superior to that of the mother in respect of such custody, administration or application nor shall the mother be deemed to have any claim superior to that of the father.” \[Emphasis added.\]

21     As Leong Wai Kum has observed “Good legal practice operates on the principle that, where there is no pressing parental disagreement over their child’s upbringing that a custody order can help resolve, the application for custody should not even be made.” (see **_Leong WK, Elements of Family Law in Singapore_**, 3rd Edition 2018, para 9.058).

22     As an important illustration that the court will not intervene unnecessarily in the parent-child relationship where there is no actual dispute between the parents over any serious matter relating to the child’s upbringing, we need look no further than the court’s willingness to make “no order as to custody” in the appropriate case. Such an award basically means that the legal status quo is maintained, with both parents continuing to owe parental responsibility to their child, to be discharged in an equal co-operative manner. The clear rationale underlying this principle is that the courts will not intervene unnecessarily in the parent-child relationship where there is no actual dispute between the parents over any serious matters relating to the child’s upbringing.

23     This principle was first articulated by then JC Michael Hwang in the High Court case of **_Re Aliya Aziz Tayabali_** \[1992\] 3 SLR (R) 894 which was followed in a subsequent case of **_Re G (guardianship of infants)_** \[2004\] 1 SLR (R) 229 where Justice Tan Lee Meng held:

> “8.    …Where there is no immediate or pressing need for the question of custody to be settled, one should seriously consider whether an order for sole custody is in the best interest of a child, who should, without more, be entitled to the guidance of both parents….”

24     This position was affirmed by the Court of Appeal in **_CX v CY_** \[2005\] 3 SLR (R) 690:

> “18.  …We thus agree with Prof Leong Wai Kum’s comments in Principles of Family Law in Singapore (Butterworths Asia, 1997 at pp538-539 that the making of a “no custody order” should be seen as leaving the law on parenthood to govern the matter, as both parents continue to exercise joint custody over the child. **Such an order also affirms the approach of the courts not to intervene unnecessarily in the parent-child relationship where there is no actual dispute between the parents over any serious matters relating to the child’s upbringing….”** \[Emphasis added.\]

25     As Justice Vinodh Coomaraswamy observed in **_AZZ v BAA_** <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 44</span>, the court should only intervene when necessary, and the grant of custody is not a weapon to be used against the other parent, much less against third parties. As the learned judge held:

> “33.  Second, the law of parenthood give both parents joint custody of every child of a marriage even after divorce and even without a court order to that effect. Making no custody order and making a joint custody order upon divorce therefore have the same effect…

> …

> 36.     **Fifth, the court should intervene in the parent-child relationship only when necessary**. Thus, the principles set out above warrant the court declining to intervene in the parent-child relationship by making no custody order, for example, where there is little risk of future dispute between the parents over the child’s upbringing…..”

> ….

> 69.    …**custody is not an end in itself. Equally, a grant of custody is not a weapon to be used against the other parent, much less against third parties. Custody is simply a means to an end: that of promoting the welfare of the children**.” \[Emphasis added.\]

### (b)   Father’s arguments are misconceived

26     I will now address the arguments raised by Father’s counsel to persuade me that the court should make the custody order sought, even though there is no genuine dispute between Father and Surrogate regarding the upbringing and welfare of the Child.

27     First, counsel relies on “consent orders” obtained in uncontested simplified divorce cases to support his argument that “the fact that the parties are in agreement and are not disputing any issue does not prevent the Court from making orders in such a situation.” However, this reliance is misplaced. The “consent orders” obtained in uncontested divorce cases are genuinely necessary because there is an important need to ensure that children are protected even when their parents’ marriages have broken down. For that reason, there is specific legislation under section 123 of the Women’s Charter that the court has to be satisfied as to the arrangements made for the welfare of the children before granting Final Judgment for divorce. The “consent orders” in uncontested simplified track cases are therefore of a markedly different character from the consent order that Father is seeking.

28     Second, counsel relies on the court’s jurisdiction to order “declaratory relief” to argue that the court has the jurisdiction to make the custody order sought even when there is no real dispute between the parties, if the order would be of value to the parties or involved public interest. In support of the contention, counsel refers to the case of **_Tan Eng Hong v Attorney-General_** <span class="citation">\[2012\] 4 SLR 476</span> (**_Tan Eng Hong_**).

29     It seems to me that the present case does not come anywhere close to meeting the necessary requirements for the grant of declaratory relief. It is a fundamental rule that in every case where a plaintiff claims relief against a defendant, his claim has to be founded on a reasonable cause of action. The only exception to this rule is when the plaintiff only asks for a declaration of right encompassed by O15 r 16 of the Rules of Court. Further, it is settled law that the necessary pre-requisites to an application for declaratory relief include, _inter alia_, (a) a real controversy for the court to resolve; and (b) full arguments before the court. (see the Court of Appeal case of **_Salijah bte Ab Lateh v Mohd Irwan Abdullah Teo_** \[1996\] 2 SLR (R) 80 which was affirmed in **_Karaha Bodas Co LLC v Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd_** \[2006\] 1 SLR (R) 112(CA)).

30     In the present case, there is no “real controversy” between the parties to be determined. As the High Court in **_UKM v Attorney-General_** <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHCF 18</span> (**_UKM_**) observed, the principal task of the court is that of adjudication:

> “\[152\]     **The principal task of the court is that of adjudication**. The court’s task is not to resolve society’s problems on its own motion, but rather to adjudicate disputes that are brought before it by the people and the Government. The legal system preserves this role for the courts in various ways, perhaps most noticeably through the rules of standing, which ensure that only a person who has a genuine interest in a disputed issue, as opposed to a “mere busybody”… may bring the issue before the court: see also _Karaha Bodas Co LLC v Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd_ \[2006\] 2 SLR (R) 112 at \[14\] per Judith Prakash J. Another important device is the **well-established rule that judicial power may be exercised only upon the presentation of an actual controversy**: see _Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada v Jervis_ <span class="citation">\[1944\] AC 111</span> at 114 per Viscount Simon LC, cited with approval in _Foo Jong Peng v Phua Kiah Mai_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 4 SLR 1267</span> at \[24\] per Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA. **This rule ensures that future litigants are not prejudiced by the court “laying down principles in an abstract form without reference or relation to actual facts”, and avoids the difficulty of “defining a principle adequately and safely without previous ascertainment of the exact facts to which it is to be applied**.”….” \[Emphasis added.\]

31     I now turn to the case of **_Tan Eng Hong_** which counsel relies on to argue that the court has the jurisdiction to make orders even where there is no real dispute between the parties, if the order would be of value to the parties or involved public interest. In that case, the appellant had been arrested and charged for engaging in oral sex in a public toilet with another male person. He was initially charged under s377A of the Penal Code, but this was subsequently substituted with a charge under s294(a) for the commission of an obscene act in a public place, to which he pleaded guilty. However, before the charge was substituted, he had applied under Order 15 rule 16 of the Rules of Court for the court to declare s377A unconstitutional (“Application”). After the substitution of the charge, the Attorney-General applied to strike out the Application. An issue which arose was whether there was no real controversy to be adjudicated as there was nothing at stake for the applicant who had pleaded guilty to the substituted charge.

32     In the event, the Court of Appeal held that the threshold for striking out was a high one and the appellant had shown an “arguable” case on the constitutionality of s377A. Further, that the appellant had “_locus standi_” to bring the constitutional challenge as he had satisfied the necessary requirements, including a “real controversy” between the parties. Whilst the CA did opine at \[143\] that “Where the circumstances of a case are such that a declaration will be of value to the parties or to the public, the court may proceed to hear the case and grant declaratory relief even though the facts on which the action is based are theoretical”, it actually found, on the facts, that there was indeed a “real controversy” to be determined. First, the appellant had at the outset been arrested, investigated, detained and charged exclusively under s377A which raised the issue as to whether his initial detention and prosecution were in accordance with law within the meaning of Article 9(1) of the Constitution.[^11] Second, there was a real and credible threat of prosecution under section 377A.

33     Even assuming, for the sake of argument, that there is in existence a real controversy between Father and Surrogate, there has certainly been no full arguments before the court. In fact, the Surrogate was absent at the hearing, and had purportedly consented to the application. It is settled law that the court expects sufficient and proper argument. There are no declarations without argument: that is quite plain. (see **_Metzger v DHSS_** \[1977\] 3 All ER 444 at 451). In the UK case of **_Michael Victor Gawler v Paul Raettig_** \[2007\] EQCA Civ 1560 at \[37\], Sir Anthony Clarke MR in delivering the decision of the Court of Appeal observed that:

> “All will depend upon the facts of the particular case … However, such cases are likely to have a number of characteristics in addition to the critical requirement that an academic appeal is in the public interest. **They include the necessity that all sides of the argument will be full and properly put**… **It seems to me that in the vast majority of such cases, this must involve counsel being instructed by solicitors instructed by those with a real interest in the outcome of the appeal**..” \[Emphasis added.\]

34     It therefore seems to me that this application ought not to have been taken out in the first place. The court only intervenes in the parent-child relationship when there is a genuine need to ensure the child’s arrangements are sorted out. There is no such genuine need here.

## Issue 2 – Will a Custody Order bring real value to Father and Child?

35     In any case, I find that the custody order sought would not bring any real value to the parties. It will not change the legitimacy status of the Father and Child relationship and there is no evidence at all that it would increase the Child’s chances of obtaining a Student Pass.

### (a)   Incorrect to characterise the application as an application to take over parental rights from Surrogate

36     Counsel argues that Father has taken out this application because he has no rights or obligations in respect of the Child. As gay marriages are not recognised in Singapore, the child is illegitimate having been born out of wedlock. Hence, Father requires a custody order to take over Surrogate’s parental rights, entitlements and obligations over the Child, thereby vesting the parental rights in Father

37     At the outset, it is important to recognise that the law of parenthood is distinct from the law of custody. As Leong Wai Kum has observed, the relationship between parent and child is created without legal process (see **_Leong WK, Elements of Family Law in Singapore_**, 3rd Edition 2018, para 7.024 to 7.028). Parents become “parents” because they are :

> (a)     The natural biological parents.

> (b)     An adult who has succeeded in adopting the child under the Adoption of Children Act. The parent-child relationship created through an adoption order granted by a court is a legitimate relationship.

> (c)     A “parent” under the Status of Children (Assisted Reproduction Technology) Act (SCARTA) in respect of children born through the assistance of reproduction technology. SCARTA clarifies legal parentage and status of children conceived through ART but only if the child is born on or after 1 October 2014, and only in the context of assisted reproduction services permitted in Singapore. The laws are built on the premise that the child should only have a single set of parents. A woman who has carried a child as a result of ART will be treated in law as the child’s mother. Legal fatherhood depends on various factors, but the default position is that the birth mother and her husband who consented to the ART treatment will be the child’s legal parents.

38     It is therefore incorrect to characterise the application as one that seeks to transfer “parental rights” from Surrogate to Father, for several reasons.

#### Who is the father?

39     Counsel argues that the common law received as the basic law in Singapore would only take cognizance of the relationship between parents and their child where it was, by its substantive rule of legitimacy, a legitimate relationship. At common law, illegitimate children are not of their father, but of their mother, and have no father. Biological fathers of illegitimate children have no rights, responsibilities or entitlements in respect of children. These rights fall entirely on the mother of the child. Counsel cites Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore, Vol 11, at para 130.528 in support of his argument. Counsel also cites an old English case of **_re M, An Infant_** <span class="citation">\[1955\] 2 QB 479</span> where the court had to decide whether it was necessary for a father of an illegitimate child to give his consent to the child’s adoption. In deciding that the consent of the father was not necessary, Denning LJ held at page 487 that “…… law of England has from time immemorial looked upon a bastard as the child of nobody, that is to say, as the child of no known body except its mother. The father is too uncertain a figure for the law to take any cognizance of him except that it will make him pay for the child’s maintenance if it can find out who he is. The law recognises no rights in him in regard to the child: whereas the mother has several rights… The truth is that the law does not recognise the natural father at all.”

40     I find counsel’s arguments extreme and unsupported in law. It seems clear that even if the Child is not legitimate under Singapore law, Father remains the natural biological parent with natural parental rights and responsibilities without any court order. In fact, it is in his capacity as a “parent”, that Father has taken out this application under section 5 of the GIA which clearly provides that _either_ a “parent” or a court appointed guardian, may make an application under that section. Father, who is named as the Child’s only parent in the birth certificate, therefore clearly has rights as a “parent” under the GIA.

41     It is settled law that the legitimacy of the child is not relevant to applications under the GIA which does not define “parent”. Hence, in the High Court case of **_UMF v UMG_** <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHCF 20</span>, Justice Debbie Ong held that a grant-aunt had no _locus standi_ to bring an application under s5 of the GIA. Justice Debbie Ong explained that the rationale of limiting the persons who can apply for orders in respect of the child is because the parent is at the “apex” in his relationship with the child, and that “parents” are the only adults who have parental rights and responsibilities without any court order. (see para 28, 29 and 33 of the judgment).

42     If this were not the case, then Father would not have no _locus standi_ to bring an application under section 5 of the GIA which would put an end to the matter.

43     I should also add that Lord Denning’s comments in **_re M, An Infant_**, should be confined to the question whether the father of an illegitimate child had to give his consent to a child’s adoption in the UK. Suffice to say, in Singapore, the High Court in **_Attorney-General v Chia Soo Choo_** \[1994\] 2 SLR (R) 822 decided that the natural father of a child whose relationship with her parents was illegitimate was also required to give consent to her adoption. As Leong Wai Kum has observed “With that decision, the differentiation between a child whose relationship with her father is legitimate and a child whose relationship is not within the Adoption of Children Act section 2 is just apparent. It is not real. Current family law, thus, no longer treats the child whose relationship with her parents is not legitimate less favourably than it does the child whose relationship with her parents is legitimate.” (see **_Leong WK, Elements of Family Law in Singapore_**, 3rd Edition 2018, para 10.13 and 10.14).

#### Who is the mother?

44     Second, there is no reason to accept that the Surrogate should be the “presumed” parent possessing parental rights which can be transferred to father. Father’s counsel relies on a common law presumption that the gestational mother will be deemed to be the mother of a child and is the “presumptive person upon whom falls the rights, entitlement and obligations in respect of the child”. Counsel cites two antiquated Latin maxims: _Mater semper certa est_ (the mother is always certain) and _Mater is est quem gestation demonstrant_ (the mother is the woman whom the pregnancy points out) to support his argument.

45     The common law presumption was, and the maxims were, developed at a time when, in truth and in fact, a baby was begotten in the mother’s womb through sexual intercourse between a man and a woman, and not made with the assistance of reproductive technology. It would have been inconceivable at that time that a day would come where a woman could contract to “only lend her uterus” with the result that the mother was “not certain.” In any case, the presumption is easily rebuttable. On the facts, the egg donor is unknown, the birth certificate states that the name of mother is “Mrs. Not Known”, and the Surrogacy Agreement specifically provides that the birth certificate shall “only bear the name of the intended father.”

46     Counsel also relies on section 6 of SCARTA which provides that: “Subject to section 9, where a woman has carried a child as a result of a fertilisation procedure, the woman shall be treated as the mother of the child from the date of the birth of the child, whether she was in Singapore or elsewhere at the time she underwent the fertilisation procedure.” On the facts of the present case, the presumption in SCARTA does not apply. SCARTA only applies to children born on or after 1 October 2014 and only in the context of assisted reproduction services permitted in Singapore. Surrogacy, whether it is traditional or gestational, altruistic or commercial, is not permitted.[^12]

47     In the absence of any clear statutory law expressly spelling out who is to be presumed to be the mother in such cases of commercial surrogacy, the common law presumption has no leg to stand on.

#### In any event, parental rights cannot be transferred

48     Third, even if Surrogate is presumed to be the mother of the Child, there is currently no legislative framework under which Father and/or his Partner, as intended/commission parents, can apply for “parental orders” and/or to legitimise the child in Singapore. Singapore does not have any legislation for couples such as the Father and his Partner who have undergone commercial surrogacy to formally apply for “parenting orders”, including a declaration of the child’s legitimacy.

49     In the UK, legislation has been enacted by way of the Human Fertilization and Embryology Act 2008 (HFEA). Under the HFEA, the gestational mother and her partner (if any) are presumed to be the legal parents of the child, and the commissioning parents may apply for parental orders which would give them legal status as parents.

50     There is no equivalent legislation in Singapore. As mentioned above, SCARTA only applies to permitted cases of assisted reproduction services in Singapore. Even then, as the High Court in **_UKM_** observed, even for cases of permitted ART, SCARTA does not provide any means for transferring parental rights to commissioning parents:

> “\[171\]    Further, the scheme of SCARTA does not envisage surrogacy or endorse what the Minister for Law termed “intention-based parenthood”. This may be readily appreciated through the principles for determination of parenthood under SCARTA….

> \[172\] However, there is a key difference between the HFEA and the SCARTA that is relevant in this context. Whereas the HFEA provides for “parental orders” by which commissioning parents may be declared the lawful parents of a child born through surrogacy, it appears to us…. that the SCARTA does not provide any means for transferring parental rights to commissioning parents. … None of the provisions in the SCARTA contemplate that the gestational mother may be displaced as the mother of the child, or that a man who is not the husband or de facto partner of the gestational mother may be declared the father of the child.

> \[186\] … \[**SCARTA\] does not seem to permit the commissioning parents to displace the gestational mother and her husband or de facto partner as the legal parents of the child under any circumstances**.”

> \[Emphasis added.\]

### (b)   Custody order will not create a “legal nexus”

51     Any attempt to plug the gap through the law of custody is misconceived. Father argues that as the Child is illegitimate, he needs the custody order to create a “legal nexus” with the Child, “if that is what the ICA needs”. [^13]

52     However, it is settled law in Singapore that the law of custody does not distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate children. The High Court in **_Re Miskin Rowter_** <span class="citation">\[1963\] MLJ 341</span> held that the law of guardianship and custody applies irrespective of the legitimate status of the child. It does not distinguish children depending on whether their relationships with their parents are legitimate. The High Court in **_Tan Siew Kee v Chua Ah Boey_** \[1987\] SLR (R) 725 also did not take into account the illegitimate status of the infant son in deciding on an application by the father of an illegitimate infant boy for custody. The child had been cared for by the mother’s sister for some time, but when she was not able to do so, the child stayed with the father. When the father applied to formalise custody, care and control, the mother resisted the application. In the event, then Justice Chan Sek Keong granted custody of the child to father, as the judge found that the mother was “more concerned with her own welfare than that of her children”.

53     Put simply, a non-parent will not become a “parent” even if he or she obtains an award of custody. Conversely, a parent remains a “parent” even if he or she does not have custody over the Child. Therefore, a custody order would not establish a “legal nexus” by changing the legitimacy status of the Child. Importantly, this is unlike the case in **_UKM_**. A pivotal consideration in **_UKM_** was that the “legal nexus” established through the adoption order actually changed the legitimacy status of the parent-child relationship.

### (c)   No evidence that the custody order will improve Child’s chances of obtaining a student pass

54     In any case, there is no evidence that a custody order is “what the ICA needs”. There is no evidence at all that such a custody order will assist the Child obtain a student pass. Father conceded as much in his 2nd Affidavit at paragraph 5: “I will be candid that I do not have any documentary proof that an order for custody, care and control of \[the Child\] would guarantee success in an application for a student pass for \[the Child\]. I understand that visa application processes at the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority are very opaque, and that the ICA’s relevant considerations are not often shared with applicants.”

55     Instead, Father raised the following arguments. First, as mentioned above, Father relies on his suspicion that the lack of a mother’s name on \[the Child’s\] birth certificate had an impact on their applications to ICA. Hence, in the current application, he has named a “mother” for the Child. I find this suspicion purely speculative. ICA has not provided its reasons for repeatedly rejecting the various applications relating to the Child.

56     Second, in his 2nd Affidavit, Father states at para \[8\] that “I know of another family whose child was similarly conceived through surrogacy, except that the child’s birth certificate has the surrogate’s name on it. The father obtained an order for custody of the child by consent, and the student pass was granted.” When I asked counsel for the case details, having assumed that Father was referring to a Singapore case, Father filed his 3rd Affidavit where he confessed that to the best of his knowledge, the “custody order was obtained in the US court.” No further details were forthcoming. For obvious reasons, I cannot and will not rely on a case which, in any event, is not binding on me.

57     Third, in his 3rd Affidavit, Father states that that “\[the international school\] has advised that in their experience, the ICA does ask for orders for court (including custody orders) when an application for a student pass is filed.” In support, Father exhibits his exchange of emails with the Admissions Coordinator of the international school. In one email, the Admissions Coordinator explained: “Regarding the custody order helping to support the application. We have had instances during \[student pass application\] **where ICA have requested additional information** such as custody orders etc from the parents. Unfortunately as we are not privy to the decisions made by ICA I’m unable to advise on why or how this information was used.” Upon request by Father for further clarification, she wrote “I can only advise that **when ICA have requested additional information from families (not to CIS), they have requested additional information such as Court Orders**.”

58     It is quite clear that in the cases referred to by the Admissions Coordinator, it was **ICA which had initiated and requested** for the court orders for custody. In the present case, ICA has made no such request for any custody order from Father. There is no indication at all that the custody order sought would increase the Child’s chances of obtaining a student pass.

59     Fourth, Father argues that it is not necessary to furnish actual evidence and concrete proof that the Child’s chances of obtaining the student pass would be improved. Father argues that the High Court in **_UKM v AG_** <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 874</span> did not require concrete proof that the adoption order would result in the child obtaining citizenship; it was sufficient merely to show that the child’s chances would be improved.

60      **_UKM_** involved an application by a gay father who wished to adopt his 4 year old biological son who had been conceived through gestational surrogacy in the US. The applicant and his gay partner, both Singaporean citizens, had paid the surrogate mother, a US citizen, for the surrogacy services. The egg donor was unknown. The birth certificate stated that the applicant was the “father” and the surrogate mother was the “mother”. After the birth of the child, the applicant brought the child back to Singapore. The applicant then applied for Singaporean citizenship for the child who had acquired US citizenship by virtue of the surrogate mother. In August 2014, the Immigration and Checkpoint Authority (ICA) rejected the citizen application but granted the child a LTVP. The applicant then wrote to the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) for advise on how his son could be allowed to stay in Singapore permanently. The MSF replied that the applicant **“may choose to adopt \[his\] biological child (if conceived out of wedlock) to establish a legal nexus with him.**” In a subsequent communication, MSF stated that while the decision “essentially lies” with the ICA, establishing a legal nexus with the child “does improve \[the child’s\] eligibility for Permanent Residency/citizenship.”

61     The applicant proceeded to file an application to adopt the child under the Adoption of Children Act, which the surrogate mother consented to. In the applicant’s supporting affidavit, he explained _inter alia_ that “he was making this application because the MSF had informed him that his adopting the child would establish a legal nexus between him and the child, and thereby improve the child’s chances of acquiring Singapore citizenship or permanent residency.”

62     The High Court of three Judges overturned the decision of the District Judge below. It was satisfied that it would be in the child’s welfare to grant the adoption order. Under the Constitution, as the child was illegitimate and the mother was not a Singapore citizen, the child could not acquire citizenship by descent even though the father was a Singapore citizen (Article 122 on “citizenship by descent”, read with Article 140 and Third Schedule, para 15). Article 124 nonetheless provides that minors may still be registered as citizens if the minor is the child of a Singapore citizen and is residing in Singapore (see Article 124(1)), or in such special circumstances as the Government thinks fit (see Article 124(2)).[^14] By granting the adoption order, the child would be eligible to come under Article 124(1), as opposed to Article 124(2).

63      **_UKM_** is clearly distinguishable. First, the application was taken out for an adoption order under the Adoption Act. An adoption order would establish a “legal nexus” by legitimizing the parent-child relationship, so that the Singaporean biological father would become the “parent” of the child who is holding US citizenship. In the present case, Father, a British citizen, is not seeking to “legitimise” the Child, also a British citizen, with an adoption order. Instead, he is applying for a custody order which would not change the Child’s legitimacy status. Second, the adoption order would enable the child to become _eligible_ to apply for Singapore citizenship under Article 124(1) of the Constitution, thereby improving his chance of acquiring citizenship. Hence, when the natural biological father in **_UKM_** queried MSF on how he could increase the chances of the child remaining long term in Singapore, MSF had sent him a reply stating that he “may choose to adopt \[his\] biological child (if conceived out of wedlock) to establish a legal nexus with him.” Further, that “establishing a legal nexus with the child” “does improve \[the child’s\] eligibility for Permanent Residency/citizenship”. In the present case, quite apart from the fact that no such guidance has been given, there is really no basis to assert that a custody order would improve the Child’s chances of obtaining a student pass.

64     Finally, on the face of the consent order sought by Father, it would mean that the Surrogate continues to be a “parent” with parental rights, and Father is “on paper” and in theory, compelled to “cooperate with her for the welfare of the child.” This is because for genuine intra-parental disputes, even a sole custodian remains under the legal demand of “parental responsibility” which means that the sole custodian must continue to _cooperate with the other parent_ and always to advance the welfare of the child. The parent without “custody” continues to be a parent. Hence, in **_L v L_** \[1996\] 2SLR (R) 529, a father of a six year old girl applied for a declaration that the mother’s unilateral change of their young daughter’s surname from his to that of her new husband was unlawful and he sought an order that the mother, who had sole custody over their daughter, should undo this. He applied to declare the deed poll unlawful. The Court of Appeal held that even a sole custodian remains under the legal demand of “parental responsibility” which means that the sole custodian must continue to cooperate with the other parent and always to advance the welfare of the child. Then Justice Goh Joon Seng J explained at \[16\] and \[17\]:

> “.. while both parents of an infant are alive, they are both guardians with equal rights on the question of custody of the infant before the court. See section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act. These rights are subject to any order for custody that the court may make under section 5 of the Guardianship of Infants Act or in divorce proceedings … …. The surname of a child is the symbol of his identity and the link between the child and his father… … The mother was not empowered by the custody order to sever this link between \[the child\]and the father unilaterally by renouncing on \[the child’s\] behalf her surname L and assuming on her behalf the surname \[of the mother’s new husband.\]”

65     In this case, given my discomfort over even assuming that Surrogate should be presumed to be the mother of the Child in the absence of any specific legislation, I fail to see how introducing Surrogate as the “mother” in a court order would advance the Child’s welfare.

## Issue 3 – Is this a proper case to invoke section 5 of the GIA?

66     This application actually appears to be an attempt not to create a “legal nexus” with the Father, but to create an “appearance” of a legal nexus between the Child and Surrogate. Father’s own case is that he suspects that there is a possibility the ICA rejected the earlier applications because there was no “mother” named in the Child’s birth certificate. At paragraph 7 of Father’s 2nd Affidavit, he writes:

> “Anecdotally, I also believe that there is a possibility that the lack of a mother’s name on \[the Child’s\] birth certificate had an impact on our application for a visa for \[the Child\]. When I had my first interview with ICA for our application for Singapore permanent residency for the Child\], the ICA staff noted that there was no mother’s name on \[the Child’s\] birth certificate. I responded that, yes, there was no mother. The ICA staff the responded “what do you mean there is no mother, there has to be a mother!” I did not attempt to engage the ICA staff any further on this matter and the application was eventually rejected.”

67     Hence, whilst the application purports to seek a sole custody award for Father, it is more probably an attempt to obtain a court order to give the “appearance” that the Child has both a father and a mother who has given her “consent” to the father having sole custody. Essentially, counsel seeks to achieve this by inviting the court to utilise the law of custody as a tool to sanction the Surrogacy Agreement through a custody order, which Father hopes he can show the ICA to influence the decision on the student pass application. This is fundamentally misaligned with the proper function of the law of custody.

### (a)   Should the law of custody be used as a tool to sanction the Surrogacy Agreement?

68     In further submissions, counsel advances a bold argument, essentially arguing that the custody application amounts to an application for a court declaration to sanction the care arrangements under the Surrogacy Agreement. Counsel relies on the case of **_TQ v TR_** \[2009\] E SLR (R) 961 where the Court of Appeal, which had to resolve ancillary issues flowing from a foreign couple’s divorce in Singapore, held that a pre-nuptial agreement relating to a child’s arrangements should be presumed to be unenforceable, unless the arrangements were found to be in the welfare of the child. Counsel also relies on **_UKM_** as authority “that there is no public policy against surrogacy” in Singapore.[^15]

69     As I have explained above and which I will not repeat, this case falls far short of fulfilling the essential requirements necessary to engage the court’s powers to order declaratory relief.

70     In any case, **_TQ v TR_** involves a very different factual matrix. In that case, the court had to decide on an immediate and pressing issue under the relevant provisions of the Women’s Charter, namely, the welfare of the children in the wake of their parents’ divorce. It was in that context that the court had to decide how to treat a prenuptial agreement that was valid in the overseas jurisdiction where it had been entered into. In the final analysis, the court was concerned that any arrangements made should be in the welfare of the children, holding at “\[70\]… It might well be that the contents of the prenuptial agreement concerned coincide with the welfare of the child or the children concerned. However, the court ought nevertheless to be the final arbiter as to the appropriateness of the arrangements embodied within such an agreement.” This is unlike the present case where there is no underlying marital breakdown/dispute giving rise to a genuine concern over the Child’s welfare.

71     Importantly, in taking into account the prenuptial agreement, the court found that it was governed by a foreign law which was not repugnant to the public policy in Singapore. The court made it clear at the outset at \[105\] “Before prenuptial agreements can be considered by the court, they must generally comply with the legal doctrines and requirements that are part of the common law of contract. However, this requirement would not apply to a foreign prenuptial agreement that is valid by its proper law and which is not repugnant to, or does not otherwise contravene, any overriding public policy of the lex fori (here, Singapore)….”

72     In the present case, no evidence was adduced as to the validity of the surrogacy agreement under Indian law. It also cannot be assumed that the Surrogacy Agreement would not contravene public policy. First, it is inaccurate to cite **_UKM_** as authority that there is _no_ public policy against surrogacy in Singapore. In **_UKM_**, the High Court had only found that it is “_unclear_” what the public policy on surrogacy is and were therefore not inclined to place any weight on it in determining the case at hand.[^16] The High Court made it abundantly clear that “this is not to say that it would be unreasonable for public policy objections to be taken to surrogacy. Surrogacy is an ethically complex and morally fraught issue.”[^17] Second, and critically, the High Court in **_UKM_** found a clear “public policy in favour of parenthood within marriage (ie the position to be encouraged is that the family unit should be understood as comprising a married heterosexual couple having and raising children) and a public policy against the formation of same-sex family units…” In the present case, Father and his Partner entered into the Surrogacy Agreement fuelled by the sole desire to form a same-sex family unit. When they planned the surrogacy route, they did so with the intention of circumventing the local prohibition against surrogacy and of raising the Child in a same-sex family unit, which would possibly violate the public policy against the formation of same-sex family units. Such public policy considerations were not at play in **_TQ v TR_**.

### (b)   The law of custody is not the solution to immigration disappointments

73     At the heart of it, Father is not genuinely seeking an order for sole custody, care and control of the Child. He already has actual custody and care and control of the Child. Instead, he wishes to be armed with a piece of paper, a court order, to improve the Child’s chances of obtaining a student pass. There is no doubt that Father and his Partner are both anxious about securing the Child’s future and they both genuinely hope that the Child can continue to live and study in Singapore. However, bringing an application under the GIA, and trying to justify the application through forced and artificial legal constructs, is not the solution to immigration disappointments.

74     If Father is dissatisfied with ICA’s decision, he has to pursue the appropriate appeal channels (if any) under the Immigration Act (Cap 133) and obtain advice whether there are grounds (if any) for judicial review, bearing in mind section 39A(1) of the Immigrations Act which provides that “there shall be no judicial review in any court of any act done or decision made by the Minister or the Controller under any provision of this Act except in regard to any question relating to compliance with any procedural requirements of this Act or the regulations governing that act or decision.”

75     The rationale behind section 39A of the ICA is not in doubt– the purpose of the provision is to reinforce that the court cannot substitute its decisions for the decision of the executive in immigration matters. In **_Tey Tsun Hang v Attorney-General_** \[2015\] 1 SLR 0856, the High Court struck out an application by the Plaintiff seeking leave under Order 53 of the Rules of Court, to bring judicial review proceedings against ICA for cancelling the re-entry permit pass for him and his daughter. The court held that under section 39A of the Immigration Act, the court had no jurisdiction to deal with the merits of the Controller’s exercise of discretion in dealing with the Plaintiff’s application. Of particular relevance are the Court’s observations that immigration matters are best left to the executive arm and not the court which should not frustrate the Government decisions regarding aliens:

> “44.  … **In matters relating to national policy, good examples of which are matters relating to land planning as in** **_Borissik_** **or immigration or defence, there are good and self-evident reasons why these matters are best left to the executive arm and not the courts which are ill-equipped to make such decisions**. **This underpinned Parliament’s decision to enact s39A of the Act**, as is apparent from the speech by the then Minister for Home Affairs, Prof S Jayakumar, during the second reading of the Immigration (Amendment) Bill on 10 November 1993 when s39A was inserted. The relevant extract reads (Singapore Parliamentary Debates Official Reports (10 November 1993) vol 61 at cols 916-917):

>> .. Clause 15 of the Bill inserts a new section 39A to clarify that **the Courts cannot substitute their decisions for the Executive’s decisions in matters relating to immigration unless it is on ground of non-compliance with any procedural requirements. The intention of this amendment is that the merits of the immigration decision, that is, whether it is right or wrong, cannot be reviewed. This is to avoid a situation where the Courts can frustrate Government’s decision to expel aliens under the Act or other immigration decisions concerning aliens**….” \[Emphasis added.\]

76     Indeed, it is not inconceivable that there are many foreigners, whether married or not, who would very much want their children, whether legitimate or not, to live and study in Singapore. Crucially, whether or not ICA grants a student pass is a matter within the jurisdiction of the ICA and not the courts.

77     In **_Re A and another (children) (care proceedings: asylum seekers)_** **\[2003\]** EWHC 1086(Fam), the UK High Court discharged interim care orders and dismissed care proceedings under the Children Act 1989 in relation to two young children who had entered the UK with their parents illegally. The father’s application for asylum was dismissed, as was Mother’s application for leave to remain in the UK with the two children, as dependants of the father. The applications were refused by the Secretary of State for the Home Department; and removal directions were given. Father’s appeals were also dismissed. A social worker who visited the father reported that he was extremely distressed and placed him on suicide watch. Mother was also distressed and at one point, took an overdose of paracetamol and was admitted to hospital, although she was subsequently reunited with the children and lived with them in a family home supervised by the local authority.

78     Meanwhile, care proceedings were brought under Section 31(2) of the Children Act 1989 Act which provides that “A court may only make a care order or supervision order if it is satisfied (a) that the child concerned is suffering, or is likely to suffer, significant harm.” Interim care orders were issued to prevent the children being removed. When the matter was finally heard in the High Court, Mr Justice Munby discharged the interim care orders and dismissed the application as there was no evidence to support the contention that the children were likely to suffer significant harm whether they remained in the country or if they were returned to the country from which they came. In arriving at his decision, Mr Justice Munby made the following pertinent observations on the interplay between the function of the Court under the 1989 Children Act and the function of the Secretary of State under the Immigration Act.

> “53    ..The law, as I have said, is clear and I do not propose to add to the jurisprudence on this topic. I simply make the following points by way of emphasis:

>> i)    The functions of the court under the 1989 Act and of the Secretary of State under the Immigration Act 1971 and related legislation are, by and large, separate and distinct. The court and the Secretary of State are performing different functions.

>> ii)    The court when exercising its powers under the 1989 Act is not entitled to have regard to immigration policy. It must be guided by the interests of the child.

>> iii)   The court when exercising its powers under the 1989 Act necessarily has to apply a different test from the test that the Secretary of State applies: a) So far as concerns the Secretary of State the child’s interests are not paramount. There is a balancing exercise in which the scales start event. b) In contrast (and assuming that threshold is established in those cases where there is a threshold to be met) the court has to apply the principle that the child’s welfare is the paramount consideration.

>> iv)    Where the proceedings under the 1989 Act relate to a child who is liable to removal or deportation the jurisdiction should be exercised very sparingly.

>> v)    If, apart from immigration questions, there is no genuine dispute concerning the child, then the court must not allow itself to be used as a means of influencing the decision of the Secretary of State. Indeed, the use of the court’s jurisdiction merely to attempt to influence the Secretary of State is an abuse of process.”

79     Justice Munby also directly addressed the “extreme artificiality of the situation” in the context of the underlying realities:

> 68.    The extreme artificiality of the situation as the matters now stand is apparent from a number of factors:

>> …

>> iii)   The parents want the court to make an order (in all probability a care order, for it would seem that a supervision order will not suffice for their purposes) in order to prevent their being removed. There is no longer any real suggestion that, were the family to remain in this country, the children should be placed anywhere than with their parents. **The parents will be pressing for an order (and an order, moreover, giving the local authority parental responsibility) not because an order is really needed, and not because in truth there would be anything for the local authority to do even if it had an order, but simply to arm the parents with a piece of paper – a court order – which they hope might enable them to fend off the family’s removal to Country X**. …

> …

> 71.    The final matter is this. Although, of course, the Secretary of State is not obliged to stay his hand merely because care proceedings are on foot, the practical reality is that an illegal entrant’s removal from the United Kingdom is likely to be delayed by pending care proceedings because, as Ms Richards confirmed, the usual practice of the Secretary of State is to refrain from taking enforcement action pending the outcome of such proceedings. I do not want to be thought to be saying anything to encourage the Secretary of State to take any different course. But this humane policy comes at a price and the comity between executive and judiciary which Hoffman LJ referred to in _ex p T_ requires sensitivity on the part of the court. The jurisdiction, as Hoffmann LJ indicated, is to be exercised sparingly. The court must be alert to the possibility in cases such as this that the local authority and the court are being used by desperate parents for ulterior purposes. Just as every asylum case demands anxious scrutiny, so does every care case. **But the court must be alert that it does not allow itself to become complicit in the abuse of its own process by failed asylum seekers who may see in the processes of family law a solution to their problems not available to them within the immigration system or in the Administrative Court.**” \[Emphasis added.\]

80     Whilst that case is factually distinct as it involved asylum seekers, the observations of Mr Justice Munby on the interplay between the function of the court in child proceedings and the function of the executive in immigration matters provide a useful reminder of the court’s proper function in determining custody applications under section 5 of the GIA.

## Conclusion

81     There is no doubt that Father and his Partner both love the Child dearly and are deeply anxious about securing the Child’s future in Singapore. By this application, they seek to arm themselves with a piece of paper, a consent order of court, to present to the ICA in the hope that the Child’s chances of obtaining a student pass would be increased and prospects of remaining and studying in Singapore improved. However, this is a matter for the ICA and not the courts. This application under the GIA should not have been brought. The processes of family law should not be seen as a solution to immigration problems. In the circumstances, I dismiss the application.
