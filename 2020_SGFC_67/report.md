Family Law – Maintenance of Wife – Women’s Charter (Cap. 353), Section 69(1)

14 August 2020

### District Judge Christina Koh:

## Introduction

1       The Appellant Wife (“the Wife”) is the Complainant in Maintenance Summons MSS 4407 of 2019 and she sought interim maintenance from the Respondent Husband (“the Husband”) for herself and their daughter (“the daughter”), aged 17 years old, in an application made on 30 December 2019.

2       The parties are on the verge of divorcing and their contested divorce has been fixed for hearing in the later part of August 2020 before me.

3       The trial was heard on 31 March 2020 in the Family Courts and via Zoom during the circuit breaker period on 20 April 2020 and 27 April 2020. I gave my decision via Zoom with oral grounds (found at the Notes of Evidence of Day 4 at page 1 Line 11 to page 8 Line 9) on 30 April 2020.

4       Having made a finding of fact that the Wife earned a sufficient monthly income to support herself and that she was not in any financial need that would require the Husband to provide her with maintenance before their divorce proceedings are concluded, I dismissed her application for spousal maintenance. I however ordered child maintenance to be paid by the Husband.

5       On 14 May 2020, the Wife filed a Notice of Appeal to the Family Division of the High Court against the part of my decision that the Husband need not pay interim maintenance to her. My Grounds of Decisions are set out below.

## Background Facts

6       The Husband is 52 years old and the Wife 45 years old. The parties were married in India in 1997 and they moved to Singapore in 2000. There are two children of the marriage – the daughter, who is no longer studying nor is employed, and a younger child, their son, who is a student in the lower secondary standard. The Husband is working in a bank as a project manager and the Wife was a homemaker until she started working in 2017 for \[A\] Pte Ltd (“\[A\]”). The Husband and the two children are Singapore citizens whilst the Wife is a Permanent Resident of Singapore.

7       The parties bought their matrimonial home in 2005, a HDB flat in the east of Singapore, and stayed there together with their children until their marriage soured. The Wife and the daughter moved out of the matrimonial home sometime in July 2019 and, as of end April 2020 when the trial concluded, they were still living in the same rented premises at a condominium unit in \[B\] Residences (“\[B\]”) at a monthly rent of $1,800.

8       References to “PPO” and “POHA” have been made by the parties or their counsel in the course of the trial. As background, parties had taken up cross-Personal Protection Order applications (“PPO applications”) against each other for themselves and both the children in May 2019 in SS \[xxx\]/2019 and SS \[xxx\]/2019. These summonses were fixed for trial before me on \[xx\] September 2019. After the first day of trial, the PPO applications were withdrawn on \[xx\] November 2019 by the both of them. Each had given the other party an undertaking not to commit family violence against the other spouse and the children as a condition of the other party’s withdrawal of the relevant PPO application.

9       The parties had also filed an application for a Protection Order under the Protection from Harassment Act, Cap. 256A (“POHA applications”) against each other. Consent Orders were granted in February 2020 for the POHA applications by the State Courts.

10     The Wife had also earlier applied for maintenance in June 2019 in MSS \[xxx\]/2019 seeking maintenance for herself and the daughter which was, according to her, “withdrawn due to unforeseen circumstances” (see her Affidavit marked “C1” at Paragraph 6) and she has requested the Court to backdate her current maintenance application to June 2019.

## The Husband’s Position

11     The Husband claimed that from February 2018, the Wife expressed to him that she no longer needed financial support from him as she was gainfully employed by \[A\] (see his affidavit marked “R1” at Paragraph 20). Before February 2018, he had been “transferring $1,000 per month for 6 months” to her. The Husband also claimed he was supporting her with money and purchases prior to February 2018 as he took care of all the expenses at home (see R1 Paragraph 21).

12     His position is that he has not neglected to maintain the Wife and that she had chosen to leave the matrimonial home because she is gainfully employed, earning over $3,000 monthly and able to support herself by her own means or by “external support” from her “paramour” whom he named as one \[C\], a Director of \[A\] (see R1 Paragraph 23).

## The Wife’s Position

13     The Wife holds an undergraduate degree in commerce from the University of \[D\] (see C1 at Paragraph 7). She claimed that she earned $550 a month working as a Director in \[A\] and exhibited various certificates of achievement in her affidavit.

14     She tendered her payslips from \[A\] from January to April 2019 showing net pay of $550 a month for January, March and April and net pay of $520 for February (at C1 pages 29 to 32). She also tendered her IRAS Notice of Assessment 2019 (marked “C2”) which showed that she earned an annual income of $13,200 for the year 2018. This averages out to a monthly income of $1,100.

15     She testified that this $1,100 comprised her salary and commissions. She testified that for the year 2018, she was earning a basic salary of $500 plus[^1]. It can be assumed that she was earning $550 in 2018 based on her own counsel’s questions to her in re-examination about her monthly income for 2018[^2]. Based on C2, she earned $550 in basic pay and $550 in commissions a month for the year 2018.

### Maintenance sought by the Wife

16     The Wife sought a total of $5,680 for the maintenance of herself and for the daughter per month to cover all their expenses and she asked that this maintenance amount be backdated to June 2019. Her own expenses were stated as $4,450 and this is the amount of spousal maintenance she wanted per month.

17     She stated (at C1 Paragraph 17) that her expenses “could be mitigated if \[she\] had not left \[the\] matrimonial home” but that she was “left with no choice due to the constant harassment that \[she\] received from the \[Husband\] whilst \[she\] was there”.

18     She listed (at C1 Paragraph 9) her personal expenses of $4,450 per month and listed (at C1 Paragraph 12) the daughter’s expenses of $1,230 per month as follows:

19     It should be noted that the daughter’s tabulated monthly expenses is wrongly stated as $1,230 and that it should be $1,180 based on the figures provided.

### My Orders after the Trial

20     I dismissed the Wife’s application for a monthly allowance for her maintenance. However, I granted her application for child maintenance. For completeness, I set out here my order for child maintenance on 30 April 2020: I ordered the Husband to pay to the Wife monthly child maintenance of $1,689 for the daughter with effect from 30 April 2020, with the first payment to be made on 30 April 2020. I also ordered him to pay to the Wife three months of arrears of such child maintenance, backdated to 30 December 2019, which totalled $5,067.

## The Law

21     There is an obligation to maintain one’s wife which is set out in section 69(1) of the Women’s Charter, Cap. 353 (“the Act”) as follows:

> “(1)  The court may, on the application of a wife, and on due proof that her husband has neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for her, order the husband to pay a monthly allowance or a lump sum for the maintenance of that wife.

22     However, the Court may consider factors which will determine if such maintenance should be paid and if so, the quantum, under section 69(4) of the Act:

> “(4)  The court, when ordering maintenance for a wife, an incapacitated husband or a child under this section, shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the following matters:

>> (a)    the financial needs of the wife….;

>> (b)    the income, earning capacity (if any), property and other financial resources of the wife….;

>> (c)    any physical or mental disability of the wife….;

>> (d)    the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage;

>> (e)    the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family;

>> (f)    the standard of living enjoyed —

>>> (i)    by the wife before her husband neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for her; ..... and

>> (h)    the conduct of each of the parties to the marriage, if the conduct is such that it would in the opinion of the court be inequitable to disregard it.

23     The Court of Appeal in **_Foo Ah Yan v Chiam Heng Chow_** <span class="citation">\[2012\] 2 SLR 506</span> contrasted interim maintenance to a wife (which had the more limited objective to provide modest maintenance for immediate financial needs) to final maintenance granted to an ex-spouse as set out below:

> “\[22\] Furthermore, the duty of a husband to maintain his wife during the marriage, as provided by s 69(1) of the Act, and the obligation to provide maintenance to a former wife under s 113 of the Act are driven by separate forces. As Prof Leong Wai Kum pointed out in **_Elements of Family Law in Singapore_** (2007) at p 476:

>> In the former situation, the objective is to provide modest maintenance, namely, to help her overcome her immediate financial need which may well be the same objective when ordering maintenance for a dependent child. In the latter situation, maintenance ordered for a former wife, however, serves the far more ambitious objective of giving her a fair share of the surplus wealth that had been acquired by the spouses during the subsistence of the marriage.”

24     In the 3rd edition **_of Elements of Family Law in Singapore_** (2018), Professor Leong stressed at page 481 that the “two most important considerations in assessing maintenance for a wife… during marriage are the applicant’s financial needs and the defendant’s ability to meet them” and suggested that the goal in ordering maintenance under section 69(1) of the Act “is the modest one of helping the spouse tide over a period of financial distress”.

25     With that in mind, I now deal with the Wife’s income and earning capacity as well as her financial needs in my assessment of maintenance for her.

## Income and Earning Capacity of the Wife

26     As stated earlier, the Wife had tendered salary slips and her Notice of Assessment 2019 to support her contention that she was earning a monthly salary of $550 plus commissions. She had also tendered her CPF statements showing her employer’s contributions of $125 per month from August 2018 to January 2019, $100 for the month of February 2019 and $150 per month from March to September 2019 (see page 44 of C1).

27     At the trial she testified that she was recruited as a sales executive in June or July of 2017 with a basic salary of “some 200 plus”[^3]. She said that after 6 months of probation (at the end of 2017 or the beginning of 2018), due to her commitment, hard work and her vision of the company, she was made a director of \[A\][^4]. She testified that there were only two directors in the company, the other director being \[C\][^5].

28     Her evidence was that she was “in charge of the operations” for \[A\] which were projects from government agencies; she was in charge of the IT people who were involved in these projects; she does “multiple task (sic)” including human resource (HR) and she prepares pay slips.[^6] She testified that she was “a versatile person” and that she will “do everything”; that the IT people would report to her and that she would give their reports to management. Further, she would “monitor the sales”, “drive the sales people” and “push them to more target”[^7]. She agreed with the Husband’s counsel that she was in a “very, very responsible position”[^8].

29     Despite her duties as Director of \[A\], she claimed that she was, to date, only paid $550 a month as she was still under training and the company had to pay for her travel expenses[^9]. She claimed that the company spent between $30,000 to $100,000 on her training[^10].

30     At the trial, she was cross-examined on two documents which were exhibited in the Husband’s affidavit (R1). These are two Certificates of Employment affixed with the \[A\] letterhead with the title “Certificate of Employment” which set out her particulars and start date of employment of 1 July 2017 and which was signed off by one \[C\] as Director. These two Certificates can be found at pages 47 and 48 of R1 and they are attached at **Annex A** of these Grounds for easy reference.

31     The first Certificate stated her position of “Sales Director” and stated her “Basic Salary” as $270 a month (at page 47 of R1). The second Certificate similarly stated her position as “Sales Director” and stated her “Director Fee” as $3,000 per month (at page 48 of R1). She agreed with the information stated in the first Certificate but stated repeatedly that the second Certificate which stated her Director Fees as $3,000 was “not true”[^11]. To explain what the typographical error was, she stated that the “typo” was “the director fee, the title and also the amount”[^12]. She testified that “maybe the designation”[^13] was a typographical error; that the $3,000 sum stated was “a typo error basically”[^14] and that the word “Director Fee” was a typographical error[^15]. She also stated that “this template is used for another director as well”[^16] without explaining what that meant.

32     It was put to her by the Husband’s counsel that \[A\] had been paying her $3,000 per month from 1 July 2017 as director’s fees to which she disagreed[^17]. It was further put to her that she was lying about her salary to which she replied that it was untrue[^18].

33     After her counsel had completed re-examining her, upon the Court’s clarification, she explained that she had requested for a Certificate of Employment from her company; that the second Certificate found at page 48 of R1 was initially handed to her and that she “found that there is a typo in this”[^19] and then she requested for “the original one”[^20]. When the Court asked what was the typographical error, she replied “The 3000, the salary, uh, the director fee, the…the template which has been changed”[^21].

34     When the Court asked what had happened after she found out that there was a typographical error, she replied “So I requested for another one, so that’s the…that’s the reason. On the same day, the original, uh, one was, uh released”[^22]. She clarified that due to the fact that she had “indicated the typo”, on the same day, the Certificate with “the basic salary 270” was given to her[^23].

35     When queried by the Court as to the reason why she had asked for a Certificate of Employment, she did not want to elaborate and merely stated that it was for a “personal reason” and that it was for personal purposes[^24]. She subsequently went on to say that because she did not receive a Certificate of Employment at the time of her joining \[A\], she “wanted to have one” and thus requested her company to provide one[^25]. Finally, she stated that it may be due to her citizenship application in the year 2017 as that was the same year when the Certificates of Employment were issued[^26].

36     When the Court clarified with her whether it was possible that both the Certificates of Employment (at pages 47 and 48 of R1) were tendered to the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (“ICA”) for her application for citizenship, she answered in the negative and said that it was the Husband who prepared all the documents and that he had “kept the original document” which comprised only the Certificate of Employment which stated her basic salary as Sales Director at $270 a month (at page 47 of R1)[^27].

37     She also testified that her Husband knew very well that she did not earn $3,000 and that he had tendered the Certificate of Employment which stated that her Director Fee was $3,000 a month (at page 48 of R1) for court proceedings[^28].

## The Financial Needs of the Wife

38     The Wife claimed that when she left the matrimonial home on 3 July 2019, she had savings of some $24,000 and as of 31 March 2020, the first day of the maintenance trial, she had “some few hundred dollars left”[^29]. She also claimed that she was only able to stay at her rented condominium unit at \[B\] due to loans extended to her by her friends of $1,000 or $2,000. She stated that the rent is a steep expenditure which she cannot afford on her own (see C1 at Paragraph 19) and that she was using her savings to pay the rent[^30]. She also stated that it was impossible for her to maintain the daughter based on the latter’s monthly expenses (see C1 at Paragraph 21).

39     It will be apposite to next deal with the Husband’s income and expenses in assessing his ability to meet the Wife’s financial needs.

## The Husband’s Ability to Meet the Wife’s Financial Needs

### Income of the Husband

40     It was undisputed that the Husband’s income was $219,015 for the year 2018 per his IRAS Notice of Assessment 2019 (marked “R3”). His annual income divided by 12 months works out to a monthly income of $18,251.25. On average, his monthly income (less $1,200 Employee CPF contribution per month) is $17,051.25. His monthly salary is $15,480 (as stated in R1 at Paragraph 4) before deduction for CPF. His salary slip for February 2020 is exhibited at page 49 of R1 which shows a net pay of $14,372.75 after deductions for CPF and SINDA and the addition of extra earnings for “mybenefits encashment”.

42     It should be noted that although he tabulated his total expenses as $13,196.16, there is a calculation error as the total sum based on his figures is $13,336.16.

43     The Husband pays for all of the expenses of the matrimonial home, the domestic helper’s salary and some of the children’s expenses. He stated that he credited the bank account of the daughter with a monthly allowance of $50 since she left the matrimonial home with the Wife[^31]. He also pays the school fees of $512 for both the children.

44     As part of his monthly expenses, he claimed that this included an outstanding credit card balance repayment of $5,920.05 per month although no supporting evidence was given for it[^32]. In addition, the Husband claimed he owes about $403,470.43 (per page 7 of R1), as of February 2020, in personal loans from banks. He testified on the second day of trial on 20 April 2020 that the amount could have been reduced by nearly $12,000 as he would have paid about $5,000 to $6,000 per month for the past two months[^33]; this means he still owes a sum of $391,470.43 of which he claims he pays about $6,000 a month in debt repayment[^34]. This sum of $6,000 is not reflected as part of his $13,336.16 expenses but is in addition to it as shown in R1 Paragraph 28 at page 7.

45     The Husband tried belatedly on 22 April 2020 (through his counsel’s letter to the Court) to tender supporting documents for his credit card and personal loan liabilities after the Wife’s counsel had finished cross-examining him. This was disallowed by me at the beginning of the third day of trial on 27 April 2020[^35].

46     I accept the Husband’s expenses except for the following three items:

> i)     With respect to the husband’s expense for the monthly mortgage payment for the matrimonial flat, I note that this is paid through his CPF and so the sum of $1,024.10 should not be included in the list of the Husband’s monthly expenses;

> ii)     In addition, since the daughter is no longer a student at her Polytechnic as she been removed by her school from her Diploma course, having failed the main examination in February 2020 (see the Polytechnic’s letter marked “R2”), I have removed $500 from his expenses. The school fees of the son cannot be more than $12 as he is in studying in a government secondary school and his fees would be at citizen’s rate;

> iii)     With respect to the Husband’s income tax monthly liability, it was listed by the Husband as a monthly expense of $1,707.68. However, his Notice of Assessment 2019 (R3) shows that the tax payable is $18,807.28 which works out to a monthly tax payment of $1,567.27.

47     Hence, the Husband’s expenses in a month, together with his credit card repayment, should be **$11,671.65 (**excluding his purported $6,000 a month personal loan repayment) and not $13,336.16. Although the quantum of the Husband’s credit card outstanding balance is not known, I accept his evidence that he is mired in debt and that he is still paying off personal loans he had taken up from banks. He explained that he had taken up these loans when he was out of a job for six months in 2012 to pay for the family’s expenses and had also tried his hand at foreign exchange trading and made losses[^36].

48     On the whole, I found him to be a credible witness due to his demeanour in Court, the frank and forthright manner in which he testified and the fact that he did not downplay his lack of financial support of the Wife and the daughter when they moved out of the matrimonial home.

### Husband’s Evidence on the Wife’s Certificates of Employment in his possession

49     The Husband’s explanation on how the Certificates of Employment of the Wife had come into his possession was that \[C\] had sent them to him from the former’s office email to his email.[^37] He did not ask \[C\] to send them to him for the Wife’s citizenship application but stated that he may have appended both the Certificates to the said application to ICA[^38]. I found no reason to doubt the Husband when he said that \[C\] had sent those Certificates to him.

### Husband’s Evidence on giving a monthly allowance to the Wife

50     The Husband said that he stopped providing $1,000 allowance to the Wife from February 2018 upon the Wife’s own request. However, the Wife’s position, as stated by her counsel, was that he had stopped providing her with financial support from May 2019[^39].

51     It was nonetheless later put to the Husband by the Wife’s counsel that he had failed or neglected to adequately provide for the Wife from February 2018 to present day to which the Husband disagreed[^40].

52     The Wife’s instructions to her counsel must have changed since it was put to the Husband that he had not provided for her since February 2018 and not since May 2019. Thus, I preferred the Husband’s evidence over that of the Wife and accepted that he had stopped giving her allowance as of February 2018. This ties in with my findings that the Wife has been earning monthly income in the region of $3,000 upwards from the year 2018.

## My Findings

### Reasonable Expenses of the Wife

53     The Wife’s monthly expenses of $4,450 should be less $500 for insurance as she is not spending that money nor is it a sum being expended by the Husband for her. Her monthly expenses should also be less $900 rent (since $1800 should be apportioned between herself and the daughter) as well as less $375 for shared outgoings for the \[B\] rented home (since $200 for Utilities, $50 for Cable TV & Internet and $500 Food, Groceries and Toiletries should be apportioned between herself and the daughter). It should also be less $150 as I have assessed reasonable spending on her entertainment at $50 (and not the $100 she listed) and family outings at $100 (and not the $200 she listed). I have added $50 per month for her personal grooming. All these work out to monthly expenses of **$2,575**.

54     I have assessed her expense for insurance as $0 as the Wife testified that she is not paying for her own insurance but wanted provision for it as she did not want her insurance plan to lapse of which she says the Husband is paying for. However, the Husband testified that he had not taken up any insurance for her[^41] of which I have accepted.

### Husband unable to meet the Wife’s financial needs

56     Taking into account the Husband’s monthly net pay of $14,372.75 and his expenses of $11,671.65 (which excludes his $6,000 monthly personal loan repayments), and having ordered him to pay child maintenance to support his daughter in the sum of $1,689 per month; I find that he would be unable to pay $2,575 more a month for the Wife’s assessed reasonable expenses. In any case, even if the Husband is able to afford this $2,575 sum, I find that the Husband has not been supporting the Wife since February 2018 and that she has been self-sufficient for her own expenses since then. In fact, the Wife herself has testified that since 2017 when she started working, she was contributing towards the family’s expenses such as meals and groceries[^42].

### The Wife’s Income and Earning Capacity

57     The scope of the Wife’s work as described by her is by no means simple nor that of a trainee so I do not accept that after almost 3 years of work, she is paid only $550 a month plus commissions. She said she was a Sales Executive when she joined \[A\] in mid-2017 and became a Director at the end of a six-month probationary period. There are only two directors in the company, herself and one \[C\] to whom she reports. She agreed with the Husband’s counsel that she was in a responsible role. As a Director she is in charge of operations of the company. She is also in charge of HR and prepares pay slips; further, she testified that she is a versatile person who does everything. She stated that she monitors the sales, drives the sales people and pushes the sales staff to more targets.

58     I find that she is paid more than a basic salary of $550 plus commissions and that the Certificate of Employment found at page 48 of R1 - where it is stated that she receives $3,000 as Director Fees - is probative that she earns that amount on top of her basic salary. It is clear on the face of the document at R1 page 48 that $3,000 is director fee and this is distinct from the document at R1 page 47 where her basic salary is stated clearly. In both documents, her position is described as Sales Director. Based on the work she is handling for \[A\] and her scope of responsibility, she cannot be earning a mere $550 with commissions.

59     Her explanation of the words “$3,000 per month” and “Director Fee” being typographical errors, and her evidence that the said Certificate of Employment was based on a template, is facile and unbelievable in light of the existing evidence. She did not say that the said Certificate was issued in error by \[C\] to the Husband and never challenged the Husband’s evidence that \[C\] had sent both the Certificates to him. It was never put to the Husband by the Wife’s counsel that \[C\] had sent a wrong document (ie the Certificate of Employment stating she was paid a director fee of $3,000 a month) to the Husband.

60     Moreover, if indeed the Wife were earning $550 a month with commissions, it is curious that she would choose to rent a condominium unit at \[B\] from July 2019 for a one-year tenancy period at $1,800 a month (which was more than three times her basic salary) when she had stopped receiving an allowance from the Husband well before that.

61     It is clear that there was no agreement between the parties that the Husband would pay for her outgoings for the rented unit let alone its rent. The Wife could not have rightly assumed that he would pay for the rent and the outgoings since their relationship had broken down at that point; neither could she have assumed that she could easily apply to the courts for spousal maintenance to get all her extra expenses covered by him. Hence, I find that she had moved out of the matrimonial home on 3 July 2019 and rented the unit at \[B\] for $1,800 a month because she was earning sufficient money to afford the rent and the outgoings and she was confident that she would be able to pay for such expenses herself. I do not accept her convoluted explanation that she could not find cheaper accommodation such as renting a room in a HDB flat because she did not appear truthful on this aspect of her evidence[^43].

62     With respect to her personal expenses, it defies logic that her expenditure in order to go out to work is more than or about the same amount as her purported salary of $550. She spends $200 public transport and $300 on eating out - these expenses must be mostly incurred due to the fact that she is out of the home working. Also, some of her expense of $200 on telephone bills is also for company use as stated by her[^44]. It is worth pointing out that her clothing expense of $200 must be due to her employment too because if she is not working, it is doubtful she will need to buy $200 of clothing each month to refresh or renew her wardrobe.

63     If the Wife is to be believed that her salary is $550 a month, it does not appear to be worth her while to stay in employment with \[A\] since she would be spending the same amount of money or more on her phone bill, transport, eating out and on clothing so as to work for the company. Further, I give no credence to her claim that she is paid such a salary due to the company paying for her travel as well as spending between $30,000 to $100,000 on her training. The range for her training costs that was provided by her was so wide that it appeared to be something she had come up with on the spot under cross-examination to explain why she was still paid $550 after almost 3 years of work at \[A\].

64     Thus, I find that the Wife’s IRAS Notice of Assessment 2019 is not determinative of her actual income because its accuracy depends on what she has subjectively declared to the taxman as her income for 2018. Whether or not she has under-declared her income is between her and IRAS and I need not go further into this. Also, I find that her CPF documents are also not determinative of her actual income as her CPF statements only reflects figures which are dependent on what is declared by her employer for the salary he is purportedly paying her. Whether or not there is under-declaration by the employer is between him and the CPF Board.

65     Hence, I find that, as of 2018, the Wife has been earning at least $3,550 a month which comprises director fee of $3,000 and a basic salary of $550 a month.

## Conclusion

66     Based on the above findings, the Wife is able to adequately support herself as she has an income of at least $3,550 per month. She thus possesses an earning capacity to cover her own monthly expenses assessed at $2,575.

67     The Wife is not in immediate financial need nor in any financial distress that requires a maintenance order to be made so as to tide her over until the ancillary matters are decided. I therefore decline to make an order of spousal maintenance based on the evidence before me.
