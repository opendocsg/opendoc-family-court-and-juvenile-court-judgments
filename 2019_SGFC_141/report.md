Family law – Matrimonial assets – Division – maintenance of children

12 December 2019

### District Judge Jinny Tan:

## Introduction

1       Parties were married on 10 November 1999 in Singapore.

2       The Plaintiff (“Husband”) is 45 years old, and works as the Head of Finance and Risk Architecture in a bank in Singapore.

3       The Defendant (“Wife”) is 43 years old. In the early years of marriage, she was a teacher. Subsequently, she was a homemaker for many years. At the time parties filed their respective Affidavits of Assets and Means, the Wife was working part time in a gymnastics school.

4       There are two children to the marriage. The elder is a boy, now about 12 years old and the younger is a girl who is about 8 years old.

5       On 21 August 2018, the Husband commenced divorce proceedings against the Wife, on the basis that the Wife had behaved in such a way that he could not reasonably be expected to live with her.

6       The Wife also filed a counterclaim, citing the Husband’s unreasonable behaviour.

7       Parties were able to come to an agreement in relation to the divorce and some of the ancillary matters. Interim Judgment was granted on 21 March 2019 on the parties’ amended claim and counterclaim respectively.

8       Parties also agreed that they would have joint custody of their two children, and the care and control of the children would be granted to the Wife.

9       The issues left to be determined were therefore the access of the children, division of assets, maintenance of Wife and children.

10     On the day of the hearing of the ancillary matters, parties had also reached an agreement in relation to the access to the children.

## Orders made

11     After hearing the parties’ submissions, and after considering all the evidence before me, I made the following orders (in relation to the division of assets, maintenance of wife and maintenance of the children):

> Division of Assets

> a)     In relation to the HDB flat in joint names, if the Wife wishes to keep the flat, then Husband’s share is to be transferred to her within 3 months, with her paying 55% of the net value of the flat. Nett value would mean the gross valuation less the outstanding loan. The transfer expenses is to be paid by the Wife. The Husband will then refund his CPF monies and accrued interest from his share of the transfer proceeds. If she is unable to take over his share in the HDB flat, then she is to inform him within 2 months from the date of the Order, and the property is to be sold in the open market within 8 months from the date of the Order. Sale proceeds will be divided in the proportion of 55% to the Husband and 45% to the Wife, after payment of the outstanding loan and expenses relating to the sale. Parties to refund their own CPF from their share of the sale proceeds.

> b)     In relation to the property in the United Kingdom, if the Husband wishes to keep it, then the Wife’s share is to be transferred to him within 3 months, with him paying her 45% of the nett value of the flat. Nett value would mean the gross valuation less the outstanding loan. Transfer expenses is to be paid by the Husband. If he is unable to take over her share in the property, then he is to inform her within 2 months from the date of the Order, and the property is to be sold in the open market within 8 months from the date of the Order. Sale proceeds will be divided in the proportion of 55% to the Husband and 45% to the Wife, after payment of the outstanding loan and expenses relating to the sale.

> c)     The joint bank account is to be closed, with the outstanding balance to be paid out to the parties in the ratio of 55% to the Husband and 45% to the Wife.

> d)     In addition, the Husband is to pay the sum of $130,000 to the Wife.

> e)     Each keep their respective assets.

> Maintenance for Wife

> f)     The Husband shall pay the Wife the sum of $1,500 per month as maintenance for 1 year from 31 October 2019, then this sum will be reduced to $750 from 31 October 2020 for a year.

> Maintenance for the children

> g)     The Husband shall contribute the sum of $3,000 towards the children’s expenses. He is also to bear 100% of the children’s school fees and the school bus.

> Others

> h)     All maintenance is to commence on 15 November 2019 and thereafter on the 15th day of each month, and to be paid directly into the Wife’s bank account, except for the school fees and school bus in which the Husband shall make payment directly to the service providers.

> i)     Each party to bear their own legal costs.

> j)     Liberty to apply.

> k)     The Registrar or Deputy Registrar of the Family Justice Courts shall execute, sign or endorse any documents in relation to the sale or transfer of the HDB flat or the property in the UK if either party does not do so after having received written notice of seven days.

## Appeal

12     The Husband has now appealed against part of my decision. His appeal is in relation to the following:-

> a)     the division of the matrimonial assets, especially on the order that the Husband to pay $130,000.00 to the Wife; and 

> b)     the issue of child maintenance, especially on the order that he is to bear 100% of the school fees and 100% of the school bus fees of the children.

13     I now give my reasons for the decision I made, only in relation to the issues which the Husband is appealing against.

## Division of matrimonial assets

### Just and equitable division

14     The Court of Appeal set out the structured approach in _ANJ v ANK[^1]_ to work out a just and equitable division of matrimonial assets. This approach (with reference to _Twiss, Christopher James Hans v Twiss, Yvonne Prendergast[^2]_ and _ANJ v ANK_) may be summarised, as follows:

> (a)     express as a ratio the parties’ direct contributions relative to each other, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets;

> (b)     express as a second ratio the parties’ indirect contributions relative to each other, having regard to both financial and non-financial contributions; and

> (c)     derive the parties’ overall contributions relative to each other by taking an average of the two ratios above (the derived ratio shall be referred to as “the average ratio”), keeping in mind that, depending on the circumstances of each case, the direct and indirect contributions may not be accorded equal weight, and one of the two ratios may be accorded more significance than the other. Adjustments could also be made in respect of other relevant factors under s 112 or 114(1) of the Charter.

### The matrimonial pool of assets

15     Generally, there was no dispute on the pool of assets to be divided, and the only issue raised by both parties at the hearing was whether the Husband had unaccounted monies amounting to $225,510.44.

16     In the Husband’s Written Submissions, there were no submissions or any arguments made in relation to the exclusion of any asset from the matrimonial pool for division. There were also no submissions or arguments made in relation to any restriction imposed on any of the assets.

17     Even in the Husband’s Affidavit of Assets and Means, there was no evidence in relation to any of the assets which he claims ought not to be included into the matrimonial pool for division, or any restriction imposed on any of his assets.

18     In fact, at the hearing, the Court went through a list of matrimonial assets compiled, and asked counsel if there was any dispute in relation to the assets listed[^3].

>   
| 

“_Ct:_

 | 

_Husband’s assets – Bank accounts $63,297. Any dispute?_

 |
| 

_DC:_

 | 

_No. Everything is consistent, except no. 5 \[Bank account (unaccounted monies)\]”_

 |

  
  

19     It was only after the Court made final orders in relation to the ancillary matters that the Husband sought to adduce further arguments on the exclusion of certain assets into the pool. There is no provision in the Family Justice Rules allowing for further arguments to be canvassed after the conclusion of the ancillary matters hearing, and therefore I did not allow a re-hearing of the issue in relation to the assets to be included or excluded from the matrimonial pool when this was never even raised in the ancillary hearing in the first place.

#### Allegation of monies which the Husband had failed to account for

20     The Wife claims that the Husband failed to account for the following[^4]:-

> a)     20 March 2018, $116,000 was withdrawn from his bank account ending 4694;

> b)     4 April 2018, $29,510.44 was transferred out from his account ending 0411; and

> c)     21 March 2019 $80,000 was transferred out from his account ending 4694.

21     Although the Wife raised this in her 2ndAffidavit which was filed sometime in end August 2019, the Husband, at no time after that, sought leave to reply to these allegations. Since there was no evidence by the Husband explaining these withdrawals/transfers on affidavit, at the hearing, the Husband’s counsel could only rely on the documents already in the filed affidavits to explain the alleged withdrawals/transfers.

22     However, based on documents, some of these withdrawals/transfers could be accounted for.

23     At Page 376 of the Husband’s 2nd Affidavit, it shows that on 17 March 2018 $116,000 was transferred to another account of his ending with 411. There is a corresponding statement from his account ending 411 showing the deposit on 20 March 2018, and this is found at Page 168 of the same affidavit. Therefore, it is clear that the Husband was merely transferring monies from one account to another account.

24     At Page 169 of the Husband’s 2nd Affidavit, it shows that on 4 April 2018, there was an online transfer of $29,510.44. While the Husband’s counsel explained that the Husband transferred this sum to his UK account to pay for some loan, his mother’s maintenance and mortgage payments, there is no evidence before the court and what Husband’s counsel submitted is evidence from the bar.

25     At Page 511 of the Husband’s 2nd Affidavit, it shows that on 19 March 2019 $80,000 was transferred to another account of his ending with 411. There is a corresponding statement from his account ending 411 showing the deposit on 21 March 2018, and this is found at Page 180 of the same affidavit. Again, the Husband was merely transferring monies from one account to another account.

26     Therefore, the only sum not accounted for is the sum of $29,510.44 and therefore, I included this into the pool for division.

#### Matrimonial pool of assets

27     Therefore, the pool of assets for division is as follows:-

#### Just and equitable division

28     Both parties appear to agree that this is a single income marriage, and that the structured approach as put forward by the Court of Appeal in _ANJ v. ANK[^5]_ does not apply.

#### The approach taken in TNL v. TNK

29     However, both parties differ as to whether the approach taken by the Court of Appeal in _TNL v. TNK[^6]_ applies.

30     The Wife’s position is that the approach in _TNL v. TNK_ applies because this is a long single income marriage and the matrimonial assets should be divided equally between the parties. The Husband’s position is that this is not a long marriage, and it is a moderate length marriage, and therefore the approach in _TNL v. TNK_ should not apply. The Husband’s position is that there should not be equal division of the assets between the parties and the court should look at the trends in coming to a determination on the division.

31     Both parties appear to take the position that the approach taken in _TNL v. TNK_ is applicable to only long single income marriages.

32     However, from a closer reading of _TNL v. TNK_, the Court of Appeal did not appear to deal with only long single income marriages. The Court of Appeal held that the “structured approach” would not be applicable to single-income marriages.

> _“42_      _The question that these appeals raise is whether the ANJ approach should apply to marriages such as the present where roles are divided along more traditional lines, ie, where one spouse is the sole income earner and the other plays the role of homemaker. We shall refer to these marriages as “Single-Income Marriages”._

> _43_      _Our reconsideration of the ANJ approach in the context of Single-Income Marriages stems from the fact that ANJ approach tends to unduly favour the working spouse over the non-working spouse. This is because financial contributions are given recognition under both Steps 1 and 2 of the ANJ approach. Under Step 1, the working spouse in a Single-Income Marriage would be accorded 100% (or close to 100%) of direct contributions. He or she would also be accorded a substantial percentage under Step 2 solely on the basis of his or her indirect financial contributions, and this could well be the case even if he or she made little or no non-financial contributions. On the other side of the equation, this means that the non-working spouse is, in this sense, doubly (and severely) disadvantaged._

> _44_      _We do not think that such an outcome is at all consistent with the courts’ philosophy of marriage being an equal partnership. Nor do we think that this was this court’s intention in ANJ. Quite the contrary, we reaffirmed the rationale behind the broad-brush approach in ANJ (at \[17\]) by highlighting that “mutual respect must be accorded for spousal contributions, whether in the economic or homemaking spheres, as both roles are equally fundamental to the well-being of a marital partnership” \[original emphasis omitted; emphasis added in italics\]. However, giving effect to this principle in the context of a Single-Income Marriage and within the framework of the ANJ approach would almost inevitably result in some degree of artificiality: the court would either have to award the non-working spouse a very high percentage in Step 2 (which may appear to disregard the working spouse’s indirect financial contributions), or accord a very high weightage to Step 2 at Step 3. In some, if not most, cases, the court would have to do both._

> _45_      _In ANJ, we held (at \[30\]) that the principles enunciated in that case are not necessarily exhaustive and that we did not expect them to be hard and fast rules that must immutably be applied even to cases of exceptional facts. In this regard, we are of the view that the ANJ approach should not be applied to Single-Income Marriages._

33     The Court of Appeal in _TNL v.TNK_ looked at precedents and observed that in long single income marriages, the courts tend towards an equal division of the matrimonial assets and agreed with the approach taken by the courts in previous cases. The Court of Appeal left the question of what considerations would attach in short single income marriages.

34     The Court of Appeal in _TNL v. TNK_ clearly enunciated that the _ANJ_ structured approach should not be applied in single-income marriages. The Court of Appeal then looked at trends and precedents before reaching a just and equitable division of the matrimonial assets.

35     This is the approach taken by the Court of Appeal in _TNL v. TNK_.

36     Therefore, I do not agree with the position taken by the Husband on his argument that the approach in _TNL v. TNK_ is not applicable to our case.

#### Trends and precedents

37     The parties are nit-picking on whether this is a moderate or a long marriage. The Wife’s position is that it is a long marriage and therefore, the assets should be divided equally between the parties. The Husband’s position is that this is not a long marriage and therefore there should not be an equal division of assets.

38     Parties were married on 10 November 1999 and the Interim Judgment was granted on 21 March 2019. This is almost a 20-year marriage. Whether it is a moderate length or a long marriage, the Court has to look at trends and precedents in order to determine what is a just and equitable division. This is the approach enunciated in _TNL v. TNK._

39     Judicial Commissioner Debbie Ong (as she then was) emphasized in _UBM v. UBN[^7]_ that the power of the Court to divide the assets is exercised in broad strokes and re-affirmed the broach brush approach taken by the Courts and that parties should not be arguing what separates a moderate length and long marriage.

> _“That said, I would caution parties embroiled in matrimonial disputes against extending their battlefield in litigation by nit-picking on whether their case should be classified as a Dual-Income Marriage, to which the structured approach in ANJ v ANK applies, or a Single-Income Marriage, to which it does not. One should not split hairs in this way, for it would undermine the aspirations of the WC and the family justice system if the exercise of dividing the matrimonial assets gives incentive to the parties to argue over fine brush financial contributions. Neither should parties be inflexible by arguing where a bright blue line should separate a short marriage from one of moderate length and a long one. The power to divide must be exercised in broad strokes; the broad brush approach has been affirmed many times over by the Court of Appeal.”_

40     Judicial Commissioner Debbie Ong (as she then was) examined the trend and precedents relating to short single income marriages in _UBM v.UBN_. The starting point for identifying the relevant trend of division in short single income marriages which the Court pointed out is _Zhou Li Jie v. Wang Chengxiang[^8]_ , involving a 9 year childless marriage, where the court noted a just and equitable division would be between 10% to 20% of the total pool.

41      _Zhou Li Jie_ is not the starting point for our consideration here and can be easily distinguished from the facts here. The marriage between the parties is about twice as long as _Zhou Li Jie_ and there are two children to the marriage.

42     In the case of _BOR v. BOS[^9]_, the Court of Appeal dealt with a marriage of 11½ years. The Court of Appeal again repeated that the structured approach did not apply in a single income matrix. The Court of Appeal repeated their observations in _ATT v ATS[^10]_ on the trends in “moderately lengthy marriages”, where courts tended to award 35-40% of the matrimonial assets towards the homemaker wife in moderately lengthy marriages. From the examples, what was “moderately lengthy” was a period 15 to 18 years.

43     The cases involving marriages between 17 to 20 years which the Court of Appeal in _ATT_ considered were as follows:

> a)     In _ZD v. ZE[^11]_, the wife in a 17-year marriage was awarded 35% of the matrimonial assets.

> b)     In _MZ v. NA[^12]_, the wife in a 18-year marriage was awarded 45% of the assets.

> c)     In _Koh Bee Choo v. Choo Chai Huah[^13]_ , the wife in a 20-year marriage was awarded 50% of the matrimonial assets.

44     After considering the trends and precedents, the wife of 15 years in _ATT_ was awarded 45%.

45     It would appear that the trend and precedents set out in the previous cases, reflect an inclination towards equality in the division of assets involving marriages of more than 15 years.

46     The Court of Appeal in _NK v. NL_[^14] reiterated the proposition laid down in the case of _Lock Yeng Fun v. Chua Hock Chye_[^15] wherein the Court of Appeal had endorsed the views expressed by Debbie Ong Siew Ling and Valerie Thean in “Family Law”[^16] and held that:-

> _“It is true that, by their very nature, such kinds of contributions to the marriage are.. difficult to measure because they are intrinsically, incapable of being measured in financial terms. ….. Difficulty in measuring the financial value of such contributions has never been – and ought never to be – an obstacle to giving the spouse concerned his or her just and equitable share of the matrimonial assets that is commensurate with his or her contributions, taking into account (of course) the other relevant contributions and factors”._

> _It could be contended that in most cases where one party experiences great financial success, the other often bears a heavy burden in respect of the children and home; in some cases this entails the sacrifice of any potential for career development. Non-financial contributions are impossible to measure, and success on that front, intangible and difficult to define. It is hoped that this would not stand in the way of courts according due regard to the fact that the financial aspect is but one facet of the many demands that husband and wife must have weathered if a family has had many years together._

47     The Husband, in this case, submitted that this was not a typical single income marriage. His case is that the Wife refused to seek gainful employment despite repeated requests, and she did the bare minimum at home and the Husband would land up cleaning the house when he was off work or over the weekend. He claims that the Wife did little in terms of her duties as a wife and mother. His submission was that a just and equitable division would be for him to keep 70% of the HDB flat, the entire UK property and each party to keep their own assets.

48     The Wife disputes the Husband’s allegations. Her case is that she was a devoted home maker and a caring mother. Due to her efforts as a stay at home mother, he had prospered occupationally and the two children have flourished. She was initially working but in 2006, she left to live with the Husband in UK when he moved to work in the UK. In her Affidavit of Assets and Means, she elaborated on her role as a mother and wife, and also explained the reason for not working for the major part of the marriage.

49     Assuming the value of the HDB flat is about $438,263[^17] and the UK property about $279,695.97[^18], what the Husband is submitting is that the Wife should be getting only about 16% of the nett pool of matrimonial assets:-

(Based on Husband’s proposal that he gets 70% of the HDB flat, the entire UK property and each to keep their own assets)

50     Even for a 9-year childless marriage similar to _Zhou Li Jie_, the court would have granted 10-20% to the homemaker wife. Therefore, what the Husband is submitting, is not in line with the trend of cases.

51     The fact that parties are agreeable for the children to remain in the care and control of the Wife, also reflects the fact that the Wife must have contributed towards the care of the children during the marriage. If she had not been a good home-maker during the marriage, the Husband would not have allowed the children to continue being in the care of the Wife. Marriage is a partnership between two parties. The Wife may not have contributed financially but she would have contributed in a non-financial way.

52     I take guidance from what Judicial Commissioner Debbie Ong (as she then was) had stated in the case of _UBM_.

> _“No useful purpose is served by parties litigating the matter in a mathematical fashion, filing affidavit after affidavit on every contribution they can come up with. Divorcing couples were once in an intact, functioning relationship, they chose to marry each other for better or for worse. .. Who is to say that had one spouse not been present in the life of the other, the latter would have been as financially successful and thus able to contribute a greater share to the pool of matrimonial assets? Conversely, one cannot, on hindsight, tell with certainty whether the presence of the other spouse in one’s life had any negative effect on one’s career. Countless decisions, small and large, are made in the course of a marriage. Many significant forks in life’s road occur during the course of a marriage. The broad brush approach is thus a key feature in the resolution of disputes over the division of matrimonial assets. The final ratio also ought to reflect the philosophy of marriage as an equal partnership of different efforts. Matrimonial disputes are best managed, and families better supported, by a sensible, broad brush process which does not incentivise calculative behaviour.”_

53     Similarly, the court should not incentivise criticizing and downplaying the spouse’s contributions during the marriage. If parties are allowed to criticize their spouse in the various affidavits, it will lead to the spouse being defensive and affidavits will be filed to rebut the allegations and there will also be cross allegations made. The courts would be inundated by thick voluminous affidavits of parties accusing each other for bad decisions made, criticizing each other for things that had happened years ago. This will only lead to an acrimonious divorce proceedings, which is not beneficial for parties, especially parties with children. How can parties be kind and co-operate with one another when parenting their children in future, knowing and reading all the negative things that had been stated by their ex-spouse in sworn statements?

54     Parties had been married for so many years, and had two children. There may have been decisions made during the marriage by either party or by both parties collectively, for which one party may not have been happy with on hindsight. However if nothing had been done about it then, that party cannot years later come to court and criticize and begrudge the spouse for having done what he had done.

55     In the present case, the Husband was responsible for the generation of income in the marriage and the Wife may have played a minimal role since she was a homemaker. He also helped care for the children despite being the breadwinner. It is good that he helped with the care of the children, because this would have allowed him to build a bond with the children. He should not be begrudging the quality and quantity of the time that he had spent being with the children.

56     Therefore, having considered the relevant circumstances and given the length of the marriage, parties’ contributions to the marriage, applying a broad brush approach and considering the trend and precedents relating to marriages longer than 15 years, I divided the matrimonial assets in the proportion of 55% to the Husband and 45% to the Wife.

#### Manner of Division

57     Based on the division of 55%:45%, I therefore ordered the following:-

> a)     In relation to the HDB flat, if the Wife chooses to keep the flat, the Husband’s share, title and interest shall be transferred to her within 3 months, with her paying him 55% of the nett value of the flat. The nett value means the sum equivalent to the valuation less the outstanding loan. The transfer expenses are to be paid by the Wife. The Husband will then make the necessary refunds into his CPF from his share of the transfer proceeds.

> b)     In relation to the UK property, if the Husband chooses to keep the property, then the Wife’s share, title and interest shall be transferred to him within 3 months, with him paying her 45% of the nett value of the property. The nett value means the sum equivalent to the valuation less the outstanding loan. The transfer expenses are to be paid by the Husband.

> c)     Should the respective party decide not to keep the HDB flat/ UK property respectively, then it is to be sold in the open market and after payment of the outstanding loan and expenses relating to the sale, the proceeds are to be divided 55% to the Husband and 45% to the Wife. Parties are to then make the necessary refunds into their CPF account (in respect of the sale of the HDB flat).

> d)     The joint bank account is to be closed, with the outstanding balance to be paid out to the parties in the proportion of 55% to the Husband and 45% to the Wife.

> e)     As for the rest of the assets in their own names amounting to $400,586.37, based on 55%-45% division, it would mean that the Husband should be keeping assets worth $220,322.50 and the Wife $180,263.87. As the Husband currently has assets worth $351,793.69, this would mean that he would have to pay the Wife $131,471.19. I therefore ordered that the Husband to pay the Wife the sum of $130,000 (rounded down), with each keeping the rest of their assets in their own names.

## Maintenance for the Wife

58     The Wife has been a home- maker for many years. The orders I had made in relation to the maintenance payable to her will allow her to get some assistance and time for her to get back into the workforce

59     The Husband is not appealing against my orders relating to the maintenance for the Wife. Therefore, I will not elaborate on my reasons for the orders made in relation to this issue.

## Maintenance for the children

60     The Husband is proposing to pay the sum of $1,000 per month per child and that he will pay for the children’s medical insurance as they fall due.

61     The Wife is proposing that the Husband pays for all of the children’s expenses.

62     First and foremost, parenting is a joint effort. Under Section 68 of the Women’s Charter, it is the duty of a parent to maintain or contribute to the maintenance of his or her children. Both parties are the parents to the children, and both must be responsible in maintaining the children.

63     Plaintiff relied on _TBC v. TBD[^19]_ and submitted that the children’s maintenance should be borne equally between the parties and not in proportion to their means. Since he had calculated the children’s expenses to be $2,830, each parent should bear $1,415 towards the maintenance of the children and hence, his proposal of $2,000 is “over and beyond what is expected of him”.

64     Under the Women’s Charter, the court has to take into account various factors in assessing the quantum of maintenance – financial needs of the child, income, earning capacity and other financial resources of the parties, whether the child has any physical or mental disability, standard of living enjoyed by the child, manner in which the child is being educated or trained.

65     By taking a position that parties should bear the children’s expenses equally would be to disregard the income, earning capacity and financial resources of the parties, which are factors to be considered by the Court under the Women’s Charter.

66     The Husband has also chosen to rely on one part of the judgement in _TBC_ but failed to consider the other part of the judgement, where Justice Kan held that

> _“if one parent is unable to contribute equally with the other parent, then that parent should contribute what he or she can, and the other parent should make up the shortfall, so that the child will receive the full measure of maintenance”._

67     In a recent case of _UHA v. UHB[^20]_, Justice Ong reiterated that:-

> _As to the reasonable maintenance that parents must provide, the law is clear – both parents are equally responsible for providing for their children, but their precise obligations may differ depending on their means and capabilities (see AUA v ATZ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 674</span> at \[41\])._

68     Justice Ong upheld the lower court’s decision in calculating the proportions of both parties’ income on the evidence and relying on that to calculate their share of expenses.

69     Therefore, the Husband’s submission that the children’s maintenance should be borne equally between the parties and not in proportion to their means, is incorrect.

70     In his Affidavit of Assets and Means, the Husband declared his average monthly income to be $23,760[^21].

71     The Wife has been a homemaker for most of the marriage. In her Affidavit of Assets and Means, she declared that she was working part time and earning a gross income of $1,800[^22]. Even when she was working full time in the early part of the marriage, her income was $3,200[^23].

72     Looking at the Husband’s income of $23,760 and the Wife’s potential earning capacity (which I had taken at $3,200), it would be reasonable for the Husband bear around 88% of the children’s expenses. I did not take the Wife’s current salary of $1,800 when calculating the proportion of contribution each party should bear. This is because the salary she is earning now is based on part-time employment and not full time employment.

73     I had taken the Wife’s potential earning capacity at $3,200 because the Wife not been working for many years, and even for a part-time employment, she was only earning a gross income of $1,800. It may be difficult for her to find a full time employment, and because she had been out of the workforce for so many years, she does not have the accumulated experience as her peers, and she may face some difficulty in obtaining an income which is more than what she had earned in the early years of marriage.

74     The Husband listed the children’s expenses at $3,030/month (excluding their school fees of $7,000)[^24]. The Wife listed the children’s expenses at $3,872/month (excluding school fees). Both parties’ estimation of the children’s monthly expenses do not differ much. It may be that the Husband may have used lower figures while the Wife may have used higher figures in their respective lists. Since the difference between the parties’ list of expenses for the children is not very large, it is reasonable to take the sum of $3,500 as the children’s monthly expenses.

75     Since I found that it is reasonable for the Husband to bear 88% of the children’s expenses, based on $3,500/month being the children’s reasonable monthly expenses, I therefore ordered that the Husband to contribute $3,000 (figure is rounded down) towards the children’s expenses.

76     In relation to the children’s current school fees at international school and school bus, the Husband is currently paying for it. The parties have agreed for the children to be transferred to a local school[^25]. From the Wife’s submissions, it appears that she has attempted to apply for the children to be enrolled in local schools[^26]. Since parties have already made arrangements for the children to be enrolled in local schools pursuant to their agreement, I did not see any need to make a specific order for the children to be transferred to a local school.

77     The school fees and school bus expenses when the children go to local schools will be substantially lower than what the Husband is paying now. Since the Husband is earning substantially much more than the Wife, I therefore ordered that he is to bear 100% of the school fees and school bus. The parties have already begun the process of changing schools, it is a matter of time the children will leave the international schools. There is no evidence of any problems with the application to local schools. I therefore did not see any need to make changes to the payment arrangements to the children’s international schools which have been in place for some time, and it is anticipated that such payment may not be in place for much longer.

78     It will of course, be in his interest, for the children to be transferred to local schools as soon as possible, so that he can reduce the amount he has to pay towards the children’s school fees. He can therefore be involved in the school selection and registration progress and be informed if there are any problems in relation to the admission to local schools.

79     I ordered that all maintenance to be paid by the Husband shall start from 15 November 2019 and thereafter the 15th day of each month and is to be paid directly into the Wife’s bank account, except school fees and school bus for which the Husband will be making payment directly to these service providers.
