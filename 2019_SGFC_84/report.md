Family law – Division of Matrimonial Assets

Family law – Maintenance

2 August 2019 - Judgment reserved.

### District Judge Chia Wee Kiat:

## Introduction

1       In _ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGCA 34</span> (“_ANJ_”), the Court of Appeal (“CA”) set out a structured approach towards the division of matrimonial assets under s 112 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353) (“WC”). The structured approach involves three broad steps by which the ratio of the parties’ direct contributions is first ascertained, relative to that of the other party. This is followed by ascribing a second ratio of the parties’ indirect contributions, relative to that of the other party and finally deriving the parties’ overall contributions relative to each other by taking an average of the two ratios (see _Twiss, Christopher James Hans v Twiss, Yvonne Prendergast_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGCA 52</span> at \[17\]). In _TNL v TNK_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 15</span> (“_TNL”)_, the CA had the occasion to revisit _ANJ_. In particular, the CA noted (at \[41\], \[43\] and \[45\]) and that while the _ANJ_ approach works well in “Dual-Income Marriages”, the approach should not be applied to “Single-Income Marriages” as the approach “tends to unduly favour the working spouse over the non-working spouse”. The CA went on further to observe (at \[47\]) that in long Single-Income Marriages, the courts tend towards an equal division of the matrimonial assets and the CA was “in general agreement with this approach”.

2       The present case involves a husband who works as a Funeral Director and a wife who was a homemaker throughout their marriage. Unfortunately, the marriage did not survive the test of time. After 20 years, the parties ended their marriage leaving the matrimonial assets to be divided and the question of maintenance for the wife to be decided. These ancillary matters came up for hearing before me on 19 June 2019.

3       In an unusual twist, the wife (the non-working spouse) has asked the court to apply the _ANJ_ approach towards the division of the matrimonial assets. The husband (the working spouse), on the other hand, has urged the court to apply the _TNL_ approach which favours equal division in long Single-Income Marriages. Why did the parties adopt positions that seem to be at odd with the observation in _TNL_ (at \[43\]) that the _ANJ_ approach “tends to unduly favour the working spouse over the non-working spouse”? At the core of this ancillary hearing lies the question of whether there are exceptions to _TNL_ such that the _ANJ_ approach may still be applicable notwithstanding that the marriage is one that consists of a working spouse and a non-working spouse.

## Background

4       The parties were married on 19 January 1998. They were both divorcees at the time of the marriage and have no children arising out of this marriage. The wife was an insurance agent at the time of marriage and had stopped working at the husband’s request.[^1] The husband was then employed by the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF). After leaving the SAF, he joined a multi-level marketing company for about a year before entering the funeral services line.[^2] The husband is 66 years old this year and the wife 61 years old.[^3]

5       On 26 December 2017, the husband was admitted to a local hospital after he experienced chest and back pain.[^4] During a visit to the hospital, the wife discovered to her immense surprise and shock that the husband had been transferred from his Class B1 ward to a Class A ward at the direction of a woman \[T\] who claimed to be his wife. When she entered the room at the new ward, the wife was shocked by the husband’s hostility and change of attitude.[^5]

6       On 14 January 2018, the wife received a text message from the husband asking her to prepare divorce papers and he was prepared to give her everything.[^6] The husband did not respond to the wife’s attempts to contact him in respect of the text message.[^7] The wife contacted the hospital on 16 January 2018 to find out the status of the husband’s condition but was informed by the hospital that the husband was discharged on 15 January 2018.[^8]

7       The husband commenced divorce proceedings on 29 March 2018[^9] based on the alleged fact that the parties had lived apart for a continuous period of a least 4 years since mid-2009.[^10] The wife disputed the fact of separation.[^11]

8       At the contested divorce hearing on 7 November 2018, the parties agreed for the husband to withdraw his claim and for the divorce to be granted on an uncontested basis on the wife’s counterclaim. The counterclaim reveals that the husband had, since being taken away from the hospital by T, admitted to having an extra-marital affair with T. The husband had kept the affair hidden from the wife for over 10 years. The husband had been paying for T’s expenses whilst the wife had been taking care of his needs and health all these years. Despite the wife’s best attempts and efforts to save the marriage, the husband had refused any possibility of a reconciliation. An Interim Judgment (“IJ”) was accordingly granted on the counterclaim on an uncontested basis based on the husband’s unreasonable behaviour. At the time IJ was granted, the parties were married for about 21 years.[^12]

9       As there are no children to the marriage, the issues for determination at the ancillary hearing are mainly:

> (a)     The division of matrimonial assets; and

> (b)     Maintenance for the wife.

10     Apart from the affidavits for the ancillary hearing, the parties also made reference to the Affidavits of Evidence-in-Chief (AEICs) filed for the divorce hearing and the Answers to Interrogatories.[^13]

11     The husband contends that the present case involves a Single-Income Marriage stretching 20 years. He was the sole income earner whilst the wife played the role of homemaker. The husband submits that the marriage falls squarely within _TNL_’s categorisation of long Single-Income Marriages and therefore an equal division of the matrimonial assets would be fair and equitable.[^14]

12     The wife contends that whilst she was primarily the homemaker and the husband was the main breadwinner, she had rental income from her shop unit at Grandlink Square. In addition, she had brought substantial assets into the marriage. As such, the wife submits that it would be just and equitable to adopt the _ANJ_ approach.[^15]

13     After hearing the parties’ submission on 19 June 2019, I adjourned the matter to give it further consideration and for a decision to be subsequently given. I note that the positions articulated by the parties at the hearing varied in some aspects from their written submissions. Whilst it is not uncommon for parties to vary or change their positions in the course of family proceedings, my review of the parties’ oral submissions, written submissions and their affidavits presented a number of computational and other issues which were difficult to reconcile without clarifications. Accordingly, I requested for counsel’s assistance to provide the court with a Joint Summary of their updated positions. The Joint Summary was duly filed on 17 July 2019 and I thank counsel for their assistance. Counsel have also confirmed that they have no objection for the decision of the court to be rendered in writing.

14     In these written grounds, I shall first consider the division of matrimonial assets and then the question of maintenance for the wife.

#### POSB Account No. 124-

17     The husband had in his affidavit stated that POSB Account No. 124- was in his sole name.[^16] However, at the ancillary hearing, counsel for the wife tendered a copy of a bank book which shows that POSB Account No. 124- is in the joint names of the husband and the wife. The husband did not object to the admission of the copy of the bank book.

18     In the Joint Summary, the wife states that the account was opened by the wife before the parties were married and that the monies were provided for wholly by her. The wife states further that the husband was added in as a beneficiary but is only entitled to the monies upon the wife’s death. The wife contends that the said account being opened before the marriage and not being the co-operative partnership of efforts should be excluded.

19     In the Joint Summary, the Husband asserts that since the wife has averred to have named the husband as the beneficiary of this account, the sums should be taken as a gift by the wife to the husband. The husband states that the bank account would constitute a matrimonial asset liable to division.

20     I note that there is nothing in the wife’s affidavits that alluded to when the account was opened, when the husband’s name was added in and when the monies were deposited. There is also nothing in the affidavits to show that the wife had deposited the monies in the account. In fact, the wife’s written submissions (at \[25\]) dated 6 June 2019 attributed POSB Account No. 124- as a matrimonial asset under the husband’s name. The wife had also contended in the written submissions that “each party would have largely contributed directly to the assets in their respective names” (at \[31\]). The position she has taken in the Joint Summary seems to be contrary to the earlier position.

21     In the absence of satisfactory evidence, I have adopted a broad brush approach to include POSB Account no. 124- as a joint asset and attributed the sum of $7,676.06 equally to the parties as their direct contributions.

#### POSB Account No. 043-

22     Although this is an account in the joint names of the wife and Dr P,[^17] there is no dispute that the monies in the account belong solely to the wife.[^18]

23     The wife contends that the sums of $16,845.65 and $31,416.85 should be excluded as these are inheritance money and gift from the wife’s late father.[^19] The wife has produced documentary evidence in support of her contention.[^20] If these sums are excluded, the balance to be included in the asset pool would be $3,196.67.

24     The husband does not dispute the wife’s contention. However, the husband points out in the Joint Summary that the deposits were made into the wife’s bank account in 2014 and 2005 respectively. More than 10 years have lapsed from the time of the second deposit. There is no basis provided by the wife to determine how much of the inherited sums have been spent over the course of the marriage, and how much have remained intact. The wife, however, contends that she had to borrow from third parties to pay for the household expenses in order that she need not use or rely upon the said inheritance and gift.

25     I note that the wife was a homemaker throughout the marriage. Other than the monthly rent of $390 (net) from the rental of her shop unit (purchased on 21 December 2001), she did not have any other source of income.[^21] She says that the maintenance provided by the husband was sporadic and the expenses over the years of the marriage were in excess of the maintenance given. The shortfall between the maintenance was covered by the wife’s own pre-marital assets, rental income, inheritance monies and loans taken for the benefit of the parties.[^22]

26     In the Skeletal Submissions, the husband submits that maintenance of varying sums were paid to the wife without pause throughout the marriage though the maintenance never exceeded $3,000 and was as low as $500 towards the last stretch of the marriage.[^23]

27     Looking at the broad picture, I note from the husband’s employment history from the time he left the SAF that he was not a high income earner.[^24] At one point, he could only give the wife maintenance of $200 as he was undergoing a period of transition.[^25] On 19 January 2010, he incorporated his company AB Pte Ltd.[^26] His declared monthly income is $1,000[^27] and he states that he gave the wife $500 a month.[^28] For over 10 years, the husband was having an extra-marital affair and paying for T’s expenses.[^29] Given his limited income and his stretched expenses, the maintenance provided by the husband to the wife would have been modest at best.

28     As the wife was a homemaker, it is unlikely that she could have accumulated any significant amount of savings in the course of the marriage. Having regard to all the circumstances, I accept the wife’s position that the balance in the account includes the inheritance money and gift from her late father. Accordingly, the sums of $16,845.65 and $31,416.85 should be excluded.

#### CDP Shares

29     The wife contends that the shares in her CDP account amounting to a value of $158,195.14 should be excluded as these were acquired prior to the marriage or gifted to her by the late father who passed away in 2014.[^30] She has deposed that she did not trade in shares after the marriage.[^31]

30     The husband accepts that 1,360 Singtel shares worth $4,352 were gifted by the wife’s father. Less the Singtel shares, the wife’s other shares are worth $153,843.14. The husband contends that the wife has not exhibited proof that these shares were purchased before marriage. The husband contends that her claim that she did not trade with them at all, for more than 20 years, is implausible. According to the husband, the wife’s brother is an avid stock trader and the husband has heard them discussing the purchase of stocks. Hence, save for the Singtel shares, the wife’s remaining shares should be taken as matrimonial assets.[^32]

31     I note that the wife has provided the husband with the available CDP statements from 2011 onwards. [^33] She explains that she was not able to obtain earlier statements as SGX does not supply old statements more than 7 years ago.[^34]

32     The CDP statements provided by the wife would have allowed the husband to track the wife’s purchase and sale of shares during the relevant period (see _BLV v BLW_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGDC 357</span> (at \[36\]-\[37\])). Although the CDP statements did not cover the entire period of the marriage, they would provide at least a reasonable snapshot of the wife’s trading practice over a fair number of years during the marriage.

33     “The evidential burden lies on the party asserting a proposition, or refuting other evidence brought into play.” (_UJF v UJG_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHCF 1</span> at \[55\]). In _UYP v UYQ_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHCF 16</span> (“_UYP_”) (at \[10\]), the wife had contended that the husband had other insurance policies that he failed to declare. The husband’s counsel confirmed his instructions that there were no undeclared insurance policies. The court noted that the wife did not tender any evidence to prove otherwise and accepted the husband’s position.

34     Similarly, in the present case, the husband has not produced any evidence to prove his assertion that the wife had traded in shares during the marriage. This is despite the fact that he has been provided with all the CDP statements that the wife was able to obtain. In addition, the husband’s claim that the wife had discussed the purchase of shares with her brother is so vague as to be of little evidentiary value; he did not even specify when the alleged discussion took place or the details of what was discussed.[^35]

35     Having regard to all the circumstances, I accept the wife’s position that the shares in wife’s CDP account should be excluded from the matrimonial pool.

## Adverse Inference

36     The wife alleges that the husband is hiding the bulk of his assets and had under-declared his actual income.[^36] The wife contends that it is inconceivable that the husband being the founder and Funeral Director of his own company to be paid only $1,000 in monthly salary whilst T though designated as Managing Director, receives $7,000 a month despite probably doing just administrative and accounting work. T’s previous job was as a part-time accountant and her income was at most $2,000.00 a month.[^37]

37     The wife alleges that the husband has dissipated his assets over the years in anticipation of divorcing the wife, namely:

> (a)     He paid rental for T as well as her expenses including her MBA studies amounting to at least $113,500;

> (b)     He paid for at least 5 IVF attempts in Malaysia with T amounting to at least RM 50,000;

> (c)     He has given his CPF withdrawal of $56,32500 to T to purchase 52,000 shares in his own company as a gift.

38     The wife points out that the husband is the founder of the company and yet he has only 8,000 shares whereas T has 92,000 shares.[^38] The wife submits that the allotment of 92,000 shares to T is clearly a blatant attempt by the husband to hide his actual assets or to dissipate his assets. The wife points out that T’s first tranche of 52,000 shares were gifted to T by the husband who was then the sole shareholder and controlling interest in the company. As for the second tranche of 40,000 shares, T claims to have paid for them out of her own savings but the fact that she was only working part-time when she first came to Singapore in 2007 for a period of 2 years and then earning not more than $2,000 a month shows that this claim is unlikely and that the funds would probably have come from the husband.[^39]

39     The wife submits that an adverse inference should be found against the husband and not only should the monies dissipated amounting to some $190,000 be added back to the pool, the wife should be given a higher proportion of the matrimonial assets in order to obtain a just and equitable division.[^40]

40     The husband denies that T holds 92,000 shares in AB Pte Ltd on trust for him. The shares held by T were issued by AB Pte Ltd on two occasions, the first on 28 May 2015 and the second on 19 June 2015. On each occasion, a POSB cheque was issued by T as consideration for the shares. T avers that $42,000 came from her own savings and $50,000 was given by the husband to help her acquire the shares.[^41] The $50,000 withdrawn from the husband’s CPF account was a genuine gift and not an attempt at dissipating the matrimonial assets.[^42] The gift was made in 2015, almost three years before divorce proceedings commenced in 2018.[^43]

41     The husband further contends that the wife’s allegations that the husband has plotted to dissipate his assets over the last 10 years in view of the divorce is implausible.[^44] The salary arrangement at AB Pte Ltd, wherein the husband was paid $1,000 and T was paid $7,000 was entered into to improve T’s chances of obtaining an employment pass and not to dissipate monies from the matrimonial pool.[^45] The husband contends that the wife has overstated the claim that the husband has dissipated his assets by expending large sums of monies on his relationship with T. He denies that he paid for the rental for his and T’s accommodation and the IVF procedures.[^46]

42     I note, however, that both the husband[^47] and T[^48] had averred in their AEICs filed in the divorce hearing that the husband had paid for T’s rental expenses and MBA course in Singapore. At paragraphs 13 and 20 of his AEIC, the husband stated as follows:

> 13.    Meanwhile, my relationship with \[T\] continued. From mid-2009 onwards, I moved in with \[T\] and resided with her at various rental properties from then until the present day. I paid for our rental expenses throughout this period.

> …

> 20.    When \[T\] chose to pursue a one-year full time MBA course in Singapore in mid-2014, I supported her financially during this period.

43     At paragraph 15 of her AEIC, T stated as follows:

> 15\. Throughout this period, the Plaintiff paid for the rental and supported me financially when I chose to pursue a one-year full time MBA course in Singapore in mid-2014.

44     In light of what both the husband and T had stated unequivocally in their AEICs, I find the husband’s attempt in his 2nd Ancillary Affidavit dated 16 April 2019 (at \[67\]) to retract what he had stated in paragraph 13 of his AEIC (i.e. that he paid for all the rental expenses) to be less than convincing. As the husband has been paying for T’s various expenses, I find his claim (at \[67\]) that T paid for the IVF treatment to be equally unbelievable. This is all the more so given the undisputed fact that the husband and T wanted to start a family together and had explored the IVF treatment as they were unable to conceive naturally.[^49] The husband had every reason to pay for the IVF treatment as he had a personal stake in the outcome of the treatment. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the husband did expend the sums of monies on T as set out in paragraph 37 above amounting to some $190,000. However, as regards the other 42,000 shares owned by T, I did not find sufficient evidence to dispute T’s claim[^50] that she had paid for the shares out of her own savings.

45     The question as to how the sum of $190,000 should be dealt involves a consideration of a more fundamental question of whether the expenditures by the husband for the benefit of T with whom he is having an extra-marital relationship amounts to dissipation of assets. As far as I am aware, there does not appear to be any case authority that answers the question directly. In _BOR v BOS_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGCA 78</span>, the CA observed as follows:

> Not every unexplained withdrawal or decrease in value in a bank account over time will be sufficient to raise a _prima facie_ case of dissipation. In this regard, we agree with the observation of Lee Kim Shin JC in _Tan Yen Chuan (m.w.) v Lim Theam Siew_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 110</span> (“_Tan Yen Chuan_”) at \[33\] that **withdrawals of money which may legitimately be explained as personal expenditures should generally be disregarded. To this, we would add that in the appropriate case, withdrawals which might be legitimately explained as genuine expenditures on business or investments ought similarly to be disregarded.** In _Tan Yen Chuan_, the court considered it appropriate to disregard the movement of sums falling “anywhere between several hundreds of dollars to a couple of thousands” (at \[33\]), but there is no hard and fast rule as to the quantitative threshold at which the court will find that a withdrawal of money does or does not call for an explanation. Rather, **this is necessarily a fact-sensitive matter and the court will consider the evidence in the context of the parties’ habits, lifestyles, business activities, and amount of the withdrawal(s) in relation to the total value of the matrimonial assets in question**.

> \[Emphasis in bold added\]

46     It is possible to surmise from the above that the test to be applied in deciding whether an expenditure amounts to dissipation is to ask whether the expenditure in question is a legitimate personal expense or genuine expenditure on business or investment having regard to the parties’ habits, lifestyles and business activities. In a properly functioning marriage, there is an expectation at law that the husband and the wife are mutually bound to co-operate with each other in safeguarding the interests of the union: s 46(1) of the WC. Here, the wife was kept in the dark of the husband’s extra-marital affair for over 10 years. The expenses expended by the husband for the benefit of T in furtherance of the extra-marital affair was clearly contrary to the interests of the union and for that reason, cannot be regarded as legitimate personal expenses. Furthermore, the amount of $190,000 expended on T was not a small amount relative to the total size of the matrimonial assets. As will be seen from the computation of the total asset pool later, this sum constitutes close to 20% of the total asset pool. For these reasons, I find that the expenditure of $190,000 is a dissipation of matrimonial assets and ought to be returned to the asset pool.

47     I find further support for this conclusion in _TNL v TNK_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 15</span> where the CA observed (at \[23\]):

> Second, and with respect to items (c) to (g), the issue is how the court should deal with substantial sums expended by one spouse during the period: (a) in which divorce proceedings are imminent; or (b) after interim judgment but before the ancillaries are concluded. We are of the view that **if, during these periods, and whether by way of gift or otherwise, one spouse expends a substantial sum, this sum must be returned to the asset pool if the other spouse is considered to have at least a putative interest in it and has not agreed, either expressly or impliedly**, to the expenditure either before it was incurred or at any subsequent time. Furthermore, **this remains the case regardless of whether: (a) the expenditure was a deliberate attempt to dissipate matrimonial assets**; or (b) the expenditure was for the benefit of the children or other relatives. The spouse who makes such a payment must be prepared to bear it personally and in full. In the absence of consent, he or she cannot expect the other spouse to share in it. What constitutes a substantial sum is, of course, a question of fact and we do not propose to lay down a hard and fast rule in this regard, except to emphasise that it is not intended to include daily, run-of-the-mill expenses.

> \[Emphasis in bold added\]

48     In his AEIC (at \[19\]-\[21\]), the husband states that from mid-2009 onwards, he had treated T as his partner both privately and publicly and in mid-2014, they decided to start a family together which led to five unsuccessful attempts at IVF treatment. Given the state of affairs, divorce was clearly a matter of time and the husband did eventually initiate the current divorce proceedings, rejecting all of the wife’s attempts at saving the marriage. As such, even if the expenditure was not a deliberate attempt to dissipate matrimonial assets, the sum of $190,000 must be returned to the asset pool as the wife has a putative interest in the monies and did not agree, either expressly or impliedly, to the expenditure.

## Proportion of Division

50     In _TNL_, the CA explained why the _ANJ_ approach should not be applied to Single-Income Marriages as follows:

> 42    The question that these appeals raise is whether the _ANJ_ approach should apply to marriages such as the present where roles are divided along more traditional lines, _ie_, where one spouse is the sole income earner and the other plays the role of homemaker. We shall refer to these marriages as “Single-Income Marriages”.

> 43    Our reconsideration of the _ANJ_ approach in the context of Single-Income Marriages stems from the fact that _ANJ_ approach tends to unduly favour the working spouse over the non-working spouse. This is because financial contributions are given recognition under _both_ Steps 1 and 2 of the _ANJ_ approach. Under Step 1, the working spouse in a Single-Income Marriage would be accorded 100% (or close to 100%) of direct contributions. He or she would also be accorded a substantial percentage under Step 2 solely on the basis of his or her indirect financial contributions, and this could well be the case even if he or she made little or no non-financial contributions. On the other side of the equation, this means that the non-working spouse is, in this sense, doubly (and severely) disadvantaged.

> 44    We do not think that such an outcome is at all consistent with the courts’ philosophy of marriage being an equal partnership. Nor do we think that this was this court’s intention in _ANJ_. Quite the contrary, we reaffirmed the rationale behind the broad-brush approach in _ANJ_ (at \[17\]) by highlighting that “mutual respect must be accorded for spousal contributions, _whether in the economic or homemaking spheres_, as both roles are _equally fundamental_ to the well-being of a marital partnership” \[original emphasis omitted; emphasis added in italics\]. However, giving effect to this principle in the context of a Single-Income Marriage and within the framework of the _ANJ_ approach would almost inevitably result in some degree of artificiality: the court would either have to award the non-working spouse a very high percentage in Step 2 (which may appear to disregard the working spouse’s indirect financial contributions), or accord a very high weightage to Step 2 at Step 3. In some, if not most, cases, the court would have to do both.

> 45    In _ANJ_, we held (at \[30\]) that the principles enunciated in that case are not necessarily exhaustive and that we did not expect them to be hard and fast rules that must immutably be applied even to cases of exceptional facts. In this regard, we are of the view that the _ANJ_ approach should _not_ be applied to Single-Income Marriages.

51     As noted above, the CA’s reconsideration of the _ANJ_ approach in Single-Income Marriages “stems from the fact that _ANJ_ approach tends to unduly favour the working spouse over the non-working spouse”. In particular, the CA noted that under Step 1, the working spouse in a Single-Income Marriage would be accorded “100% (or close to 100%)” of direct contributions. The CA noted further that the working spouse would be accorded a “substantial percentage under Step 2 solely on the basis of his or her indirect financial contributions, and this could well be the case even if he or she made little or no non-financial contributions”. This means that the non-working spouse is “doubly (and severely) disadvantaged”.

52     In the present case, the wife (the non-working spouse)’s direct contribution based on the parties’ submissions is 60%[^51] and 62%[^52]. Though the wife’s direct contribution would have to be recalibrated in light of my findings on the disputed assets above, there is no doubt that the present case is very different from the typical Single-Income Marriages contemplated in _TNL_ where the non-working spouse’s direct contribution is expected to be 0% (or close to 0%). In respect of indirect contribution, the wife has submitted that her indirect contribution is 90%.[^53] This is substantially more than the husband’s indirect contribution even though he was the working spouse. The husband’s position is that the wife’s indirect contribution is 60%.[^54] Even taking the position as proposed by the husband, this is still 20% more than the husband’s indirect contribution of 40%. Therefore, this is not a case where it can be said that the non-working spouse is “doubly (and severely) disadvantaged”. If that were so, the wife (the non-working spouse) would not have proposed for the _ANJ_ approach to be applied in this case.

53     The present case suggests that there may be instances which may not fit within the typical Single-Income Marriages contemplated in _TNL_. Here, the husband and the wife are both able to and did make direct and indirect contributions to the household; in that sense, they are no different from parties in Dual-Income Marriages (see _TNL_ at \[41\]). As such, _TNL_ is distinguishable on the facts of the present case.

54     In _ANJ_ (at \[30\]), the CA made it clear “we do not propose to say these principles are necessarily exhaustive, nor do we expect them to be hard and fast rules that must immutably be applied even to cases of exceptional facts.” In my judgment, there are no exceptional facts in the present case that would warrant a departure from the structured approach. In the circumstances, I agree with the wife that the structured approach ought to be applied in this case.

## Parties’ direct contributions

55     Based on the Joint Summary (in particular, the agreed percentage direct contributions of each party) and my findings on the asset pool, the parties’ direct contributions and the ratio of their direct contributions are computed as follows:

## Parties’ indirect contributions

56     The wife contends that this is a long marriage of 21 years and whilst there are no children arising out of the union, the wife had devoted her time, energy and resources to the welfare of the husband as well as doing household chores and attending to the maintenance of the household. The wife also contributed to the husband’s business by delivering his medication and clothing to him at odd hours of the day and night at his request and referring clients to him.[^55] The wife points out that the husband, on the other hand, had been busy with his work and save for assisting to repaint the matrimonial flat on one occasion, had not contributed towards the maintenance of the flat. Neither did the husband spend much, if any, time taking care of the wife whilst the wife had taken care of him throughout the marriage up till the husband’s hospitalization in end 2017 before he left the wife.[^56] The wife had devoted herself to the husband’s welfare whilst the husband had hidden his affair with T from the wife.[^57]

57     As a result of the husband’s involvement with T, the wife states that the husband did not give any maintenance or adequate maintenance for substantial periods of the marriage thus necessitating the wife to draw down on her own funds as well as to borrow substantially to meet the family’s expenses.[^58]

58     The husband however states that after leaving the SAF, he gave the wife his pension of $110,000.[^59] The wife disputes the husband’s claim that he had given his pension to the wife wholly. The wife contends that part of the pension was credited to the husband’s CPF account and the balance remitted to his POSB Account No. 081- which was not a joint account at that time.[^60]

59     The wife states that she had to borrow some $180,600 from a mutual close friend \[Dr P\] to meet the family’s expenses.[^61] In support of her claim, she exhibited a Statutory Declaration by Dr P dated 23 January 2018 where Dr P declared that he had loaned various sums of money between November 2009 to October 2018 to the wife and the husband amounting to $180,600.[^62] The first alleged loan of $1,500 was extended in November 2009.

60     The husband alleges that the relationship between the wife and Dr P is “unusual”. According to the husband, the wife has been a live-in caregiver to Dr P since 2008. After cohabitating, they entered into a quasi-marital arrangement with their finances: in addition to the sums transferred from Dr P to the wife, the wife also paid for household expenses upfront and sought reimbursement from Dr P, and added Dr P to her personal bank account in April 2010. Dr P’s residence at Bedok was purchased in 2016 with the understanding that the wife would continue to live with him in the long-term.[^63] In the circumstances, it is unlikely that either party expected the repayment of the sums that the wife allegedly borrowed from Dr P. To date, there is no evidence that the wife has even attempted to make repayment, notwithstanding the substantial balances in her bank accounts.[^64] The husband states further that as the wife began to devote substantial time and effort into caring for Dr P since the latter developed a series of detached retinas, he grew closer to T and started to have a relationship with her.[^65]

61     The wife explains that Dr P is a church friend who became a close family friend. As Dr P had suffered consecutive detached retinas of his right eye and required help with his groceries, household chores and transportation, the wife and the husband would fetch Dr P to church and take him out for meals and recreation, purchase his groceries and the wife would help with Dr P’s household chores as well. In 2009, the husband was involved in a traffic accident whilst riding his scooter. Dr P helped to dress the husband’s wounds and suggested that they move in to stay with him at his Loyang residence. The parties continued to stay with Dr P after he moved to his Bedok residence as they were comfortable with the arrangement which the wife described as “symbiotic”[^66] At the Bedok residence, they slept in one room. The wife and Dr P slept in a king size bed whilst the husband slept in a single bed so as to avoid disturbing the wife’s sleep as he had myoclonus which caused him to jerk his legs involuntarily when asleep. The wife slept next to the husband so that she could take of him when necessary.[^67] The wife states that she included Dr P’s name in her POSB bank account 043- in 2010 in 2010 as she trusted Dr P to take care of the husband’s expenses and to pay the bills for him in the event that she passes away before the husband.[^68]

62     On the evidence before me, it is less than clear that the sums extended by Dr P to the wife from November 2009 to October 2018 were loans extended to the wife and the husband. The wife, by her own account, has sufficient funds of her own. Why would she, for example, require a loan of $1,900 from Dr P in November 2009 for her living expenses? It seems, from all the circumstances, more probable than not that the sums were extended to her by Dr P in the context of the “symbiotic arrangement” where they shared a common household. As such, Dr P’s Statutory Declaration must be considered against this unique set of circumstances. In any event, the Statutory Declaration does not carry the same weight as a contemporaneous record of events as it was made long after the fact.

63     The wife also claims to have borrowed $10,000 from her ex-husband \[EH\] to engage private solicitors for the husband during his court martial.[^69] She exhibited a Statutory Declaration from EH dated 18 January 2019 where he declared that he had helped them with a $10,000 loan in 2001 as the wife was very distressed over the court martial case. EH states as follows:

> I am married and I have a young child and with the fact that \[the husband\] and \[the wife’s\] marriage has come to an end, I would want \[the husband\] to return the $10,000 to me.

64     The husband contends that the wife has shown no proof that EH sought repayment in the 17 years that lapsed before divorce proceedings commenced. Taking EH’s evidence in his Statutory Declaration, he is only seeking repayment of the loan now that he has remarried, has a young child, and the marriage between the parties had ended. This shows that the money was not a genuine loan from EH to the wife but an outright gift.[^70]

65     It is clear from EH’s Statutory Declaration that he is not expecting the repayment of the loan from the wife. In fact, he is expecting the husband to repay the sum. Whether or not there is a valid civil debt due from the husband to EH is a separate issue altogether. However, what is not disputed is that the wife was very concerned about the husband’s court martial case and had taken steps to help him get a lawyer. Her indirect contribution towards the welfare of the husband in this regard should be duly recognised.

66     The wife submits that the indirect contributions of the parties towards the matrimonial assets should 10:90 in her favour.[^71] Although the husband’s position is that the _ANJ_ approach should not apply, the husband has nevertheless prepared a computation based on the _ANJ_ approach in the event that the court holds otherwise. The husband’s computation based on the _ANJ_ approach, as set out in Table 4 (submitted to the court at the hearing), adopts an indirect contributions ratio of 40:60 in favour of the wife.

67     In _UWL v UWM_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHCF 17</span>, the High Court (Family Division) noted (at \[47\]) as follows:

> I note that this is a not a typical marriage because the parties do not have any children. Thus, there was no need for either or both of them to take the role of a caregiver. The traditional division of labour between the breadwinner and the homemaker does not apply here at all. Instead, both parties were very much focused on their careers. I accept that the Husband probably contributed more towards the payment of bills and other outgoing given his higher income, that he did household chores from October 2003 to August 2004 when he was searching for employment and that he cared for the Wife and her family to the best of his ability. On the other hand, I also accept that the Wife supported the Husband when he first moved to Singapore, that she took care of the expenses when the Husband was unemployed and that she cared for the Husband as well. In the circumstances, I do not think that this Court can meaningfully conclude that either party contributed to a greater extent than the other. Thus, the ratio of indirect contributions shall be 50:50.

68     In the present case, it is not disputed that the wife has made greater indirect contribution relative to the husband. This is conceded by the husband. However, given the fact that there are no children to the marriage, the wife did not have to take on the role of a caregiver. All considered, I set the ratio at 40:60 in favour of the wife.

## Average Ratio

69     Applying the structured approach, the parties’ average percentage contributions as derived from the parties’ direct and indirect contributions represented in tabular form would be as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="48.84%"> <col width="25.58%"> <col width="25.58%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Husband (%)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Wife (%)</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Direct contributions</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">53.6%</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">46.4%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Indirect contributions (both financial and non-financial)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">40.0%</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">60.0%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Average percentage contributions</b></p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>46.8%</b></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>53.2%</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

70     I have considered the guidelines in _ANJ_ (at \[27\]) on the circumstances that could shift the average ratio in favour of one party but found no compelling reason to do so on the facts before me. In the circumstances, the just and equitable outcome is to award 46.8% of the assets to the Husband and 53.2% to the Wife.

71     In _UYP_, Debbie Ong J observed (at \[52\]) as follows:

> In long Single-Income marriages and long Dual-Income marriages, inclining towards equality remains consistent with _Lock Yeng Fun_. Further, even with respect to these categories of cases, inclining towards equality is not the same as a presumption of equal division, a norm of equal division, or a strict regime that each party shall be entitled to half the assets. Inclining towards equal division still allows the court to use its discretion to deviate from an exactly equal split, yet upholds the character of marriage and provides guidance to the court. Cases have their respective unique features and where these are of significance but are not exceptional within this context, inclining towards equality enables a just and equitable division. From Professor Leong’s analysis, it appears that what is _not_ inclining towards equality would be a division beyond the ratio of 60:40.

72     The application of the _ANJ_ approach in the present case produces a final division ratio of 46.8:53.2. This falls within the band of divisions that inclines towards equality. The outcome is also consistent with the overall trends for long marriages.

## Orders – Division of Matrimonial Assets

73     For the above reasons, I make the following orders:

> (a)     The pool of matrimonial assets comprises the assets set out at paragraph 49 and is assessed at a net value of $1,082,145.07;

> (b)     The matrimonial assets shall be divided in the proportion of 46.8% to the husband and 53.2% to the wife.

> (c)     The parties are at liberty to decide on how the order on the division of matrimonial assets is to be effected. If the parties are unable to come to an agreement, they are at liberty to apply for further orders to implement the order as to the division of matrimonial assets.

74     Counsel should highlight to the court any inadvertent errors, in computations or otherwise, on the various figures stated, within a week of this decision. This judgment is to be read subject to any supplemental judgment that may be rendered to correct such inadvertent errors, if any.

## Maintenance for the wife

75     The wife contends that she has, at the husband’s request, not been working since marrying the husband and would need time to get back to work. She also has health issues which would also affect her ability to work. Her health problems would also mean higher expenses as she would no longer be entitled to medical benefits through the husband’s pension scheme after the divorce is finalised. She is 61 years of age and has to carry the sole burden of repaying the debts incurred for the parties’ benefit.[^72] The wife’s monthly expenses is $3,000 and if her proposal for division is accepted, she should be able to achieve financial preservation with her shop unit’s rental income and by renting out a room in the matrimonial flat.[^73] On the basis that her proposal for the division of assets is accepted, she submits that the sum of $1,000 a month for 3 years is reasonable as maintenance, to be paid as a lump sum.[^74]

76     The husband avers that the wife should not receive any maintenance following the divorce. The husband is 66 years this year and suffers from a series of health problems. He earns $1,000 as income and is not in the financial position to give the wife monthly maintenance.[^75] Even after the division of the matrimonial assets, her financial resources are substantial and amount to more than $500,000. The wife’s assets will also provide her passive income whether in the form of rental from her shop unit or dividends from her shares. There is little reason to find that the wife will not be able to support herself financially post-divorce. In fact, the wife did not rely on the husband’s maintenance for her own upkeep during the marriage and had even encouraged the husband to stop working due to his health condition.[^76] Given that the wife has been residing with Dr P since 2008, her accommodation is secured.[^77] The husband contends that the loans which the wife alleges to owe to Dr P and EH cannot be taken as genuine loans, nor should they be considered in assessing maintenance.[^78]

77     In _BOR v BOS_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGCA 78</span>, the CA observed (at \[118\]) as follows:

> It is well-established that the court’s power to order maintenance is supplementary to its power to order a division of matrimonial assets. Thus, courts regularly take into account each party’s share of the matrimonial assets when assessing the appropriate quantum of maintenance to be ordered (see _ATE v ATD and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGCA 2</span> at \[31\] citing _Foo Ah Yan v Chiam Heng Chow_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 2 SLR 506</span> at \[26\]). In _TNL v TNK_ at \[63\], we held that if, from the division of matrimonial assets, there is a sum which, if invested properly, would be sufficient to maintain the wife, then the award of maintenance should be no more than necessary to allow the wife to weather the transition of the divorce.

78     In the present case, the wife’s share of the matrimonial assets is 53.2% out of the total asset pool of $1,082,145. In actual quantum, she will get $575,701. As her direct contribution to the asset pool is $501,846, the husband will have to transfer some $73,855 worth of assets to her. This is not an insubstantial sum relative to the means of the parties. In addition, the wife has other assets which were excluded from division. They include the inheritance sums of $16,845.65 and $31,416.85 and shares in her CDP account worth $158,195.14. The wife also has rental income from her shop unit. As regards the repayment of the alleged loans to Dr P and EH, I have, for reasons explained earlier, found that the wife has failed to substantiate her claims.

79     If the wife manages her assets and expenses properly, she will have sufficient means to weather the transition of the divorce and maintain herself. For these reasons, I do not think any maintenance for her will be necessary. Accordingly, I order that there be no maintenance for the wife.
