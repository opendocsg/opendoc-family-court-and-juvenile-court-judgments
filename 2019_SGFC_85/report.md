Custody – Care and Control – Access

5 August 2019

### District Judge Goh Kiat Yi:

## Introduction

1       This is an application under Section 5 of the Guardianship of Infants Act commenced by the Plaintiff father (“the father”) against the Defendant mother (“the mother”) for interim care and control of the two children of the marriage pending the full determination of the children’s issues in impending divorce proceedings. There are two other related applications before me - the mother’s cross application for care and control and the father’s application to vary an interim access order (“the related applications”). Having considered the evidence and parties’ submissions, I made my orders on custody, care and control and access as set out in Annex A.

2       In summary, I ordered parties to have joint custody of the children, with care and control of the elder child to the Plaintiff and the younger child to the Defendant with liberal specified access arrangements to the respective parents for the child not in their care. I made no orders on the related applications as my orders would have covered the same issues.

3       The mother has since appealed against the whole of my decision and I now furnish my full grounds of decision.

## Background Facts

4       Parties were married on xxx 2012 and have two sons to the marriage. The elder child, \[E\], is 5 years old and the younger child, \[F\], is 2 years old. The father is employed as a Finance Manager at \[X Pte Ltd\] and the mother works as an Independent Financial Advisor.

#### The original care arrangements of the children prior to September 2018 (“the original status quo”)

5       Although parties dispute how the original care arrangements for the children came about, in particular, whether the mother agreed to such an arrangement[^1], it was not seriously disputed that the actual care arrangements of the respective children since birth were generally as follows[^2]:

> a.     \[E\] resides with the paternal grandparents on weekdays, and returns to the matrimonial home during the weekends (Friday night to Sunday night).

> b.     \[F\] would be cared for by the maternal grandmother during the weekdays but be taken back to the matrimonial home every night to be cared for by the parties and returned to the maternal grandmother the next day.

> c.     The children would spend the weekends with both parents with visits to both paternal and maternal grandparents’ homes.

#### The care arrangements of the children after the events of September 2018 (“the new status quo”)

6       Sometime in or around 19 to 24 September 2018, a series of incidents occurred which led to the fall-out between parties. This resulted in the establishment of a new status quo where both children were placed in the de-facto care and control of the mother. The care arrangements at the time of hearing are as set out in the existing by consent interim access orders dated 7 November 2018. In essence, the father has one weekend overnight access and one weekday overnight access to the children. Other salient terms of the interim access order are that overnight access shall not take place at the Defendant’s parents’ residence, and the Plaintiff’s father undertakes not to be present during the access except for one Thursday a month.[^3]

## Parties respective cases

7       The applications before me were brought about as a result of the aforementioned events in September 2018 which led to the establishment of the new status quo. Both sides advanced divergent versions as to the cause of this.

8       The mother alleges that the the paternal grandfather had exposed \[E\] to pornography and there have been fundamental behavioural problems of a deviant nature arising from \[E\]’s upbringing and teaching at the paternal grandparents’ home, to which the father had turned a blind eye to.[^4] The mother therefore had no choice but to take \[E\] back to her care to monitor his behaviour[^5] and did not want the father to be left alone unsupervised with the children until an objective and fair expert’s report was obtained on E’s behavioural problems.[^6]

9       The father’s argues that the mother had deliberately played up the child’s sexuality issues to blame the paternal grandfather, so that she could disturb the original status quo and have both children placed in her care.

10     I now turn to my findings on the disputed issues starting with the reason why the original status quo was disrupted.

## My findings

#### The allegations made against the paternal family were not made out

11     As a preliminary point, I note that the mother filed an interlocutory application vide FC/SUMXXX/2018 for a psychiatric examination of \[E\] which was dismissed on 2 January 2019. The effect of the dismissal (without further appeal from the mother) meant that I had to rely on the existing factual evidence. Having considered the same, I was unable to find that \[E\]’s conduct was deviant or that the grandfather was the cause of such conduct for the reasons that follow.

12     First, the mother alleged on affidavit she had first noticed the grandfather watching pornography _openly on his laptop and in the presence_ of \[E\].[^7] I found this to be a serious allegation and cause for grave concern, yet there is no evidence that she actually confronted the father about this. The wife only tendered 2 text messages in the entire course of the marriage from 2016 to 2018 which referred to the paternal grandfather.

13     The first of these text messages was in July 2016 where \[E\] had purportedly commented to the mother on his penis becoming big.[^8] The mother told the father that he needs to teach the son sex education earlier. This was followed by the mother’s comment which made reference to the paternal grandfather as follows:

> “_did he watch anything from your dad’s video_, **_even like accidentally chance_** _upon or what, cos he is like super observant_”. (emphasis in bold mine)

14     The second was a recent text message in September 2018[^9], where she said:

> “_anw, just now I said abt your_ **_father video watching that one is not to blame_**, _in case you misunderstood. it’s just unfortunately there were quite a few times I went to your house and saw your dad’s laptop was on, and the pictures floating around are porn sites pic. However, my only concern was with \[E\]’s behaviour and just tell you so we can monitor_ **_any potential exposure_** _to him that’s all_” (emphasis in bold mine)

15     I did not consider the text message of 22 May 2018 to be related to the paternal grandfather as all she said was that \[E\] was touching his penis. [^10] No reference was made to the paternal grandfather in that exchange.

16     The text messages plainly do not support the mother’s allegation. It is important to note that in the July 2016 text message, the mother only wondered whether the child could have accidentally watched pornography. As for the September 2018 text message, the mother said that the paternal grandfather is “not to blame” and she simply wanted to monitor “potential exposure”. This was consistent with the father’s evidence that the text message was preceded by an oral conversation where the mother had apologised and asked the father not to misunderstand her.[^11] In my judgment, the mother’s messages would have read very differently if she saw that the paternal grandfather was watching pornography openly in the presence of \[E\].

17     Second, one of the most serious allegations against the paternal grandfather was made on or around 16 September 2018. The child purportedly told the mother that “_Ah Kong’s_ **_laptop got a lot of videos_**_, Ah Kong_ **_let me see videos with him_**_, the_ **_video is people touching the neh neh and tongue to tongue and licking penis_**_”[^12] (_emphasis in bold mine). Sometime later, \[E\] asked his 14 years old aunty whether he could lick the penis of the maternal grandfather.[^13] There was also a further incident in September mentioned by both the mother and her brother on the child attempting to take a photograph of his cousin peeing.[^14] None of this appeared to have been communicated to the father until after these proceedings were commenced.

18     In this regard, the events of the 19 and 21 September 2018 are important. The father had set out in detail what had happened. He asserted that on 19 September 2018 past midnight, the mother stood at the bathroom and told the father that since he did not want to save the marriage, she will go and get \[E\] back from the paternal grandmother’s place. The mother than continued to talk about the divorce and that the breakdown of the marriage was his fault. That led to a scuffle between parties.[^15]

19     The father further alleged that on 21 September 2018, the mother started to say sarcastic things to him and picked up his mobile phone to search for “wrongs” done by him. This led to a scuffle which culminated with the mother saying that she had lost everything and that the father did nothing to save the marriage. She then picked up a knife and said she wanted to kill herself and thrust the knife at her abdomen. Subsequently the police arrived and the mother was brought back to the police station and later sent to the Institute of Mental Health for examination.[^16]

20     The mother offered no clear rebuttal to those events as she considered them irrelevant and reserved her right to expunge those allegations.[^17] Such an application to expunge the material paragraphs in the father’s affidavit was not pursued eventually. As a result, the mother did not provide any evidence to explain what had happened on those two days apart from a brief response that the father was the aggressive one and that she was forced to hurt herself as a defensive act.[^18]

21     I accepted the father’s version of events as they were supported by contemporaneous police reports[^19], a medical memo[^20] and photographs of his injuries[^21]. The father also immediately followed up with an application for a personal protection order on 21 September 2019.[^22] I was also doubtful of the mother’s assertion that she had hurt herself as a defensive act as she would more likely have used the knife to fend off the father if was the aggressive one.

22     Two important observations flow from this – first, the arguments on 19 and 21 September 2019 were clearly about the marital problems in general. Second, it appears that the mother made no mention of the conversation she had with the \[E\] previously, on 16 September 2019 where she was allegedly told by the child that the paternal grandfather watched pornography _with him_. In my judgment, these allegations lacked veracity as they were only raised belatedly after the proceedings were commenced.

23     Third, there was also insufficient evidence to support the child’s purported sexually deviant conduct. The mother had tendered CCTV footages to support her allegation that the child was sexually deviant. The videos were described as follows:

> a.     19th October – show penis to sibling

> b.     20th October – touch sibling’s penis and also pull own penis

> c.     20th October – touch sibling’s neh neh

> d.     21st October – rub his penis on my leg

> e.     7th December – rub penis against my mum

> f.     23rd November – also rub penis against my mum

> g.     4th November – take video of brother’s penis

24     In my judgment, the videos have to be viewed with circumspection as they were only recorded after the children were taken away. Further, the mother had not disclosed the full recordings despite the father asking for it numerous times over the course of proceedings.[^23] The mother’s counsel argued that these videos are too lengthy and there are privacy issues as they were footages of the bedroom.[^24] However, such moments could be censored or removed. By not disclosing the full videos, the complete picture of why \[E\] behaved like that could not be presented. This affected the weight I could attribute to the evidence. Importantly, it also meant that the incidents recorded were the _only incidents_ where \[E\] displayed sexualised conduct which was of concern but there was nothing eventful at all other times.

25     Turning now to the contents of the video, I found that they at best show that \[E\] has the tendency to play with his penis or his brother’s penis, by either talking about it, rubbing it against the mother or the maternal grandmother. He also used an Ipad to take a photograph of \[F\]’s penis whilst he was changing. In my judgment, the videos indicate that \[E\] was mischievous and he found the penis to something fun to play with. These actions could simply reflect the curiosity of a young child towards his anatomical development. I could not accept that \[E\]’s behaviour in the videos were sufficient to prove, even on a balance of probabilities, that he watched pornography with the paternal grandfather or was exposed to it.

26     To be clear, I did not go so far as the father submitted to find that these videos were manufactured by the mother as there is likewise insufficient evidence to conclude so. [^25] If this was really the suspicion, the father should have sought specific discovery of the full recordings. In any event, I observed that \[E\]’s actions in the video to be done out of his own volition rather than on the instructions of anyone.

27     Fourth, I did not agree with the Mother’s further allegation[^26] that the paternal grandfather had been sexually grooming the child or that the paternal grandmother did not stop the child from watching the videos and would continue paying games on her IPad. These were again raised belatedly after the present proceedings were commenced. The only evidence the mother had in support was what the child said to the police which was subsequently communicated to the mother.[^27] This evidence was in fact double hearsay which strictly cannot be admitted as evidence, or at best, only given minimal weight.

28     Fifth, the child appears not to display any of this sexualised conduct elsewhere, for instance, in school. There was no mention of any issues pertaining to \[E\]’s sexualised conduct in the child care teacher’s letter of 15 November 2018.[^28] The mother’s other allegations that the child was violent because of his upbringing was also addressed in the said letter. The teacher had observed that the child’s motivation in playing with guns was to catch bad guys and that the father buys toy guns and often plays with him at home to catch bad people, pretending to be policemen. There was plainly nothing sinister about such conduct of a 5-year old boy. In any event, this behaviour (of pretending to shoot with a gun) had already stopped.

29     Finally, there was insufficient evidence that there was sexualised conduct to such an extent prior to September 2018. If what the mother argues were true - in that since 2016, the child has been exposed to pornography, such sexualised conduct would have manifested itself earlier rather than suddenly intensifying in September and October 2018 at around the time the marriage had broken down.

30     For the foregoing reasons, I found that the mother was unable to prove that the child was deviant nor was his sexualised conduct attributable to the paternal grandfather.

#### The mother’s conduct in taking the children away were unjustified and not in their interests

31     It follows from my findings above that the mother’s conduct in taking \[E\] away from the father was unjustified. However, I also found that the manner in which the mother had conducted herself was of concern.

32     The father had set out in detail how the mother and her two brothers came to the child care centre on 24 September 2018 and had forcibly snatched \[E\] away from the paternal aunt and had hurt the latter.[^29] This is supported by the police reports lodged by both the father and the paternal aunt.[^30] The mother does not substantially deny the sequence of events and simply justified her conduct as within the rights of a mother to do so.[^31] I pause to note that the father could have done the same with the \[F\], when the father wanted to fetch or see \[F\]. From the text messages exhibited, the father clearly adopted a more reasonable position when communicating with the maternal uncle.[^32]

33     Second, I accepted the father’s contention that the mother was initially obstructive of access, when she did not allow the father to have access to the children when the father wanted to celebrate the birthday with the children.[^33] It should be noted that there are no allegations at all against the father’s at the material time and he should not have been deprived of access during the initial period of separation.

34     Third and most importantly, the mother took the steps above without informing the father of her serious allegations about the paternal grandfather watching pornography with the child. Her immediate recourse was to take the children away. Going back to my findings on the events of 19 and 21 September 2018 which was the key turning point, these issues were more related to the marital problems rather than the child’s purported deviant conduct.

35     I thus agreed on the evidence before me that the mother had undertaken a course of action and which was not in the children’s best interests. The father should not have been subjected to any form of restrictions on his access to the children in the first place or moving forward.

36     With these broad findings, I turn now to the present applications for orders in respect of \[E\] and \[F\]. As joint custody was not disputed, the main issues were on care and control and access.

### Orders that are in the best interest of the children

37     It is trite that in proceedings involving children, the court has to have regard to the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration: _CX v CY_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 3 SLR(R) 690</span>. Although I have found that the mother had not proven her allegations against the paternal grandfather and had not acted in the children’s interests by taking them away, rather than focusing on the mother’s blameworthiness, I only considered her conduct in light of all the other circumstances.

38     As held in _ABV v ABW_ \[2014\] 2 SLR 775 the court considers the need for both parents to have an involvement in the child’s life, which parent shows the greater concern for the child, the stability of caregiving arrangements, the maternal bond, the child’s wishes and the desirability of keeping the siblings together. I now turn to my assessment of the factors on the evidence before me.

#### Both parents are capable of caring for the children and show concern for them

39     The mother alleges that the father rarely helped out with the care of both children.[^34] The father works long hours, and normally returns home only at 11.00pm and on weekends he is usually out from the home for outings.[^35] Further, during the course of the marriage, the Defendant rarely helps with any household chores or caring for the child. He also rarely makes an effort to bond with the children or help around the house.[^36] These allegations were strenuously denied by the Father.

40     The father on the other hand portrays the mother as neglectful, asserting that she was preoccupied with the IT business, \[Z\] Pte Ltd, or her concurrent employment as an Independent Financial Advisor. The father also alleges that the mother seldom visited E when he was at the paternal grandparents’ home. In respect of \[F\], the father alleges, amongst other things, that the mother would sleep in on the weekends and let \[F\] cry in his bed without attending to him.[^37] These allegations were disputed by the mother.

41     When a marriage breaks down and a tussle for custody ensues, it is not uncommon for each parent to emphasise their parenting abilities whilst seeking to downplay the other. I found this to be so in the present case. Despite their respective positions, no contemporaneous evidence was provided by either party to show that throughout the course of the marriage, the father or the mother had been critical of each other and they have been such woeful parents. Instead, the only objective evidence are the pictures exhibited by both parents_[^38]_ which showed the children to be close to _both parents._

42     I accept that a factor that weighs in favour of the mother is that her working hours are more flexible. This is opposed to the father who has fixed working hours from 10.00 am -7.00 pm and also has to work overtime. However, I did not place much weight on this factor as the mother had prior to the breakdown of the marriage also entrusted the maternal grandmother to take care of \[F\] in the day on weekdays. This suggests that the mother was also focused on her work. Further, the father also participates in the upbringing of the children - teaching \[E\] how to read, purchasing his uniforms, attending to his vaccinations, and taking care of \[F\] at night, amongst other things.[^39] This was not rebutted by the mother in her reply affidavit.[^40] I accepted that the father was, despite his longer working hours, also an involved parent.

43     To a certain extent, both sides relied on extended family support as they were both working. On this point, the mother’s submitted[^41] that the Family Court in _TYQ v TYR_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGFC 29</span> recognised that:

> _“a parent ought \[not\] to be granted sole care and control on the basis that his or her parent (i.e the child’s grandparent) has been the primary caregiver of the child. In assessing who should be given care and control… the court has to consider the roles played by both parents as compared to each other.”_

44     Whilst this proposition is undoubtedly correct, the Learned DJ also went on to observe in the same paragraph that:

> _“the roles played by other members of the family such as the child’s grandparents remain relevant and are factors that the court should take into account, for example, in the context of child caring support which is available to the child’s parents.”_

45     In my judgment, I found that both parents have forged a good relationship with the children and they have supportive grandparents and these are relevant factors I took into account. I did not think on the evidence before me that either party was superior in terms of caregiving abilities or showing concern for the children.

#### The maternal bond and children’s wishes

46     For the same reasons above, and also given that \[E\] and \[F\] are 5 and 2 years old as opposed to a new-born infant, I did not accord significant weight to the maternal bond. The children did not express any wishes in the present case and are in any event, too young to do so.

#### Stability of caregiving arrangements

47     In my judgment, stability of the original care arrangements is the strongest factor in the present case. This was what the children have been used to, especially for \[E\] who is 5 years old. Both children are familiar with their living environment, routines and have built secure relationships with their respective caregivers. This also extends to other matters – for instance, \[E\]’s pre-school is also near the paternal grandparent’s home in Bishan.[^42]

48     Despite the mother’s allegations against the father and his family, the pre-school teacher had stated that \[E\] is proficient in academic areas and motor skills development.[^43] This information from an objective third party highlights that \[E\] has been doing well under the original caregiving arrangements.

49     Unfortunately, it was the mother’s conduct that the original care arrangements of both children, especially \[E\], was disrupted in the first place.

#### Original status quo to be reinstated

50     Weighing the factors above, it would be in the best interest of the children for the original status quo to be reinstated at least until final orders are made in the pending divorce proceedings. This would mean that care and control of \[E\] will be granted to the father and \[F\] to the mother with liberal specified access arrangements to the other side. This is consistent with the original care arrangements. As mentioned above, I found that both parents could ably care for the children.

51     Apart from stability, I was also of the view that restoring the status quo would benefit the children. By having one child each in their primary care, both families can place maximum attention on each child and rest and engage in their own activities when the children are with the other side, vice versa. Further, both parents and their respectively families will remain equally involved in both children and no one can be said to have the upper-hand. This is important in my view to the future in that both parents should be seen to be equals in parenting their children, and they should endeavour to support their children whether in their primary care or not.

52     At this juncture, I address the mother’s contention that the original status quo was a unilateral decision by the father and she had objected to it from the outset.[^44] I found the mother’s evidence to be lacking as she only submitted a recent text message in September 2018 where she had broached the topic about putting the boys together under the same roof. This was only around the time when the marriage was on the rocks and not earlier on. In any event, these hindsight allegations were also of limited relevance to what would be in the best interest of the children as what is important is the actual arrangements that the children were accustomed to. Certainly, the original status quo would never be the same given the breakdown of the marriage but the parents can and should make it work.

53     One factor which weighed against the original status quo was the separation of the siblings. In my judgment, whilst the desirability of the keeping the siblings together is a material factor, it is not an immutable rule as the assessment of best interest is necessarily fact-centric. Further, the concerns can in my view be addressed by access orders which support maximum time spent together by both siblings through the effort of both parents.

#### Access arrangements

54     I therefore invited both sets of counsel to submit on access arrangements that will give the siblings most time together in view of the split care and control order. The father’s counsel provided the Court with a comprehensive draft of the proposed access arrangements. The mother’s counsel had no instructions as her client remained of the position that care and control of both the children should go to her. Nonetheless, I took both counsel through the proposed access arrangements before making the access orders.

55     Whilst there are ongoing divorce proceedings and final orders regarding custody, care and control and access could be made by the Court hearing the ancillary matters, I was of the view that extensive access orders should still be made in the event that divorce proceedings are discontinued or are drawn out and the children’s welfare would not be undermined during this period. I also did not think that parties are so acrimonious or are lacking in insight such that they cannot comply with the orders and co-parent effectively.

## Conclusion

56     I reiterate to both parties that they remain custodial parents to both children. The split care and control orders are made with extensive access orders which apply equally to both sides. They have to look beyond their marital disputes which each other and focus on the children. There will be differing viewpoints, but the parents have to resolve these issues as amicably as possible and not view each other as adversaries. They must ultimately cooperate in the interest of their children so that they would be least impacted.

57     Finally, I made findings of fact both ways and my eventual orders were not in favour of either party. There was no need to further the acrimony and I therefore make no order as to costs.
