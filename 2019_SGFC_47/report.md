Family Law – Revised Maintenance for Wife; Costs

18 April 2019

### District Judge Christine Lee:

### Introduction

1       The present appeal is by the Husband against the Court’s decision made on 9 January 2019 regarding the revised Maintenance to be paid to the Wife and the Costs of the summons proceedings.

### Background

2       The Plaintiff Husband (“the Appellant Husband”) and the Defendant Wife (“the Respondent Wife”) married on xxx 2012 in Singapore. There are twin sons from the marriage namely, (i) B and (ii) C born on xxx 2013 (“the said 2 children”) and both were aged about 3½ years old at the time of the Ancillary Matters (“AMs”) hearing. The marriage lasted about 4 years before the Appellant Husband filed Writ of Divorce on 5 May 2016.

3       Both the Appellant Husband and the Respondent Wife were originally Chinese citizens but the Appellant Husband obtained Singapore citizenship in 2012 whilst the Respondent Wife was still a Singapore Permanent Resident at the time of the AM hearings. The said 2 children were granted Singapore citizenship from the time of their birth.

4       The divorce suit was set down on an uncontested basis based on both the Statement of Claim and Counterclaim (Amendment No 1 dated 10 October 2016) after the Defence and Reply and Defence to Counterclaim were withdrawn on 4 October 2016.

5       On 29 November 2016, Interim Judgement (IJ) was therefore granted based on the fact that the Appellant Husband had sufficiently proven the contents of the Statement of Claim and the Respondent Wife had sufficiently proven the contents of the Counterclaim (Amendment No 1 dated 10 October 2016) and the marriage was dissolved by reason that the Respondent Wife had behaved in such a way that the Appellant Husband could not reasonably be expected to live with the Respondent Wife and that the Appellant Husband had behaved in such a way that the Respondent Wife could not reasonably be expected to live with the Appellant Husband.

### Hearings before the Court

6       The Court dealt with the AMs of this case on two hearing days namely, 26 April 2017 and 8 May 2017 whereupon the Court issued its decision on all the AMs. These were:

i.     Custody, care and control of the said 2 children;

ii.     Access to the said 2 children;

iii.     Maintenance for the said 2 children;

iv.     Maintenance for the Respondent Wife;

v.     Division of matrimonial assets;

vi.     Division of the matrimonial property;

vii.     Costs; and

viii.     Other Relief

7       In its Order of Court issued on 8 May 2017 (“AMs Court Order”), the Court granted, _inter alia_, care and control of the said 2 children to the Respondent Wife because the Court was of the view that the twins should be kept together. The Court also ordered the Appellant Husband to pay the Respondent Wife, monthly maintenance in the sum of $600 for the said 2 children and $850 for the Respondent Wife herself, the latter being for a period of three (3) years until 1 April 2020.

8       The following year, both the Appellant Husband and Respondent Wife each filed applications regarding the AMs Court Order.

9       The Appellant Husband’s application was in SUM 2306/2018 filed on 29 June 2018, for orders that the Respondent Wife be found guilty of contempt of Court for breaching paragraphs 3(a), 3(b), 3(c) and 3(e) of AMs Court Order.

10     The Respondent Wife’s application was in SUM 2771/2018 filed on 6 August 2018, to seek an upwards variation of the maintenance payable by the Appellant Husband to her in the sum of $850 per month under the AMs Court Order, to $1,600 per month.

11     The Court dealt with both summons applications together on 9 January 2019 and gave its decision on the Respondent Wife’s application in SUM 2771/2018 on the same day. The Court gave its decision on the Appellant Husband’s application in SUM 2306/2018 on 9 January 2019 and 21 February 2019.

12     The Appellant Husband filed Notice of Appeal on 21 January 2019 in HCF/DCA 7/2019 against the two provisions of the Court Order relating to SUM 2771/2018 issued on 9 January 2019 (“the said Court Order”) which is the current appeal.

13     The Appellant Husband also filed Notice of Appeal on 7 March 2019 in HCF/RAS 2/2019 against the three provisions of the Court Order relating to SUM 2306/2018 issued on 21 February 2019.

### The current Appeal

14     The Appellant Husband’s appeal is against paragraphs 4 and 5 of the said Court Order which are set out below:

**Paragraphs 4 and 5 of the said Court Order:**

**SUM 2771/2018**

4.    The \[Appellant Husband\] is to make payment to the \[Respondent Wife\] of the revised maintenance in the sum $1,200 per month until 1st April 2020 with effect from 1st February 2019 and thereafter on the 1st day of each month.

5.    Each party is to bear his or her own costs in the summons proceedings.

15     In essence, the Appellant Husband is dissatisfied with the Court’s decision in granting the Respondent Wife’s application for an upwards revision of her monthly maintenance.

### Summary of the Court’s reasons for making its Order

##### Increased maintenance for Respondent Wife

16     The Court too note of the Appellant Husband’s Counsel’s submission that the Respondent Wife’s application was lacking in detail and that her Affidavit did not show any material change in her circumstances. Counsel further submitted that it was the Respondent Wife’s duty to provide such details which she had failed to do and that the only change was that the Respondent Wife’s Mother had joined her and that was why the Respondent Wife had needed a bigger place to stay[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1).

17     In the Court’s assessment, the material change in circumstances element was made out when the Respondent Wife showed that in her attempt to give effect to the AMs Court Order, her accommodation expenses had increased in the period between the AM hearings (April/May 2017) and when she submitted her variation application in SUM 2771/2018 in August 2018. This was because the AMs Court Order only provided for the Respondent Wife’s then accommodation expenses of $850 per month for a single room, as that was the only amount that had been submitted to the Court.

18     In support of her variation application, the Respondent Wife submitted documents to show that her rental expenses had initially increased to $1,800 and was currently at $1,600 per month[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) when she took up bigger premises to accommodate herself and the said 2 children. As the Respondent Wife was also working to support herself, the Court was of the view that the Respondent Wife’s explanation that she needed her mother’s assistance to help her look after the said 2 children, or as it turned out, to look after the elder child (B) only, was not unreasonable. In the Court’s opinion, this did not detract from the fact that the Respondent Wife still needed to secure premises larger than a single room costing $850 per month to live in.

19     The Court also noted that during the AM hearings, the Court’s assessment of the sum of $600 per month as being reasonable maintenance for each of the said 2 children, was without inclusion of any apportionment of the said 2 children’s share towards their accommodation expenses. At the time, the Appellant Husband, Respondent Wife and the said 2 children were all living together in the matrimonial home and such apportionment was not submitted before the Court. Hence, no provision was made at the time of the AM hearings for an apportionment of even the elder child (B)’s, share towards his accommodation expenses when the Respondent Wife left the matrimonial home and took B with her.

20     As such, the Court was of the view that there was merit in the Respondent Wife’s application for some upward revision of her monthly maintenance. Hence the Court ordered revised maintenance of $1,200 which was a difference of $350 (being $1,200 minus the current maintenance of $850) and within the remaining period provided for in the AMs Court Order, which was only up to 1 April 2020. This was in keeping with the Court’s original assessment that the maintenance payable by the Appellant Husband to the Respondent Wife, was only to assist the Respondent Wife to find financial stability for the short term after the divorce.

21     The Court also noted that the Appellant Husband had reduced the maintenance payable to the Respondent Wife for the said 2 children, from the Court ordered sum of $600 per month to $300 per month as the Respondent Wife had not taken over the care and control of the younger child[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3) (C). This was confirmed by the Appellant Husband himself during the summons hearing[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4). As such, this was not a case whereby the Respondent Wife had taken advantage of the maintenance payments by the Appellant Husband for the said 2 children, as the Appellant Husband had already ensured that he was not overpaying the Respondent Wife for the maintenance of the younger child.

22     In addition, although the Respondent Wife had asked for an increase of up to $1,600 which was almost double the amount of the original maintenance of $850 per month that had been previously ordered, the Court had assessed that it was reasonable for the Appellant Husband to pay the revised maintenance difference of $350 per month and not the full amount requested for by the Respondent Wife.

23     Regarding the Appellant Husband’s Counsel’s submission that the Respondent Wife’s Affidavit was lacking in detail on her current job and income, the Court noted that the Appellant Husband’s Counsel had the opportunity and did in fact cross-examine the Respondent Wife at the hearing of the summons application. As such, Counsel should have raised this issue with the Respondent Wife, which was not done. On its part, the Court noted that the Respondent Wife was a Litigant in Person for her summons application and at the hearing thereof, and accorded her some allowance because of this.

##### Costs for the summons proceedings

24     As the Court had granted an upward revision of the Respondent Wife’s monthly maintenance, albeit a partial revision and only to cover the remaining period until April 2020, the Court was of the view that both the Appellant Husband and Respondent Wife should bear their own costs for the summons proceedings.
