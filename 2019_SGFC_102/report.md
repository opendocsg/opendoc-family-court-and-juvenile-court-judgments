Ancillary Matters, Care and Control, Division of Matrimonial Assets, Maintenance

12 September 2019

### District Judge Tan Shin Yi:

## Background Facts

1       The Plaintiff wife (the “Wife”) and Defendant husband (the “Husband”) were married in February 2011 and they have one son, \[S\], who was aged 7.5 years when the ancillary matters were heard. The parties’ relationship was extremely acrimonious and this sparked off multiple applications relating to \[S\]. This case was docketed to me almost from the beginning and I had the benefit of seeing the parties in person and their respective solicitors, and of managing the related applications and issues holistically.

2       The Wife commenced divorce proceedings on 7 March 2018, based on the ground that the marriage had broken down irretrievably due to the Husband’s unreasonable behaviour. On the same day, the Wife also filed a Summons application for, _inter alia_, the Husband to return \[S\] to the matrimonial home and to restrain the Husband from taking \[S\] out of Singapore pending the conclusion of proceedings (Summons No. xxx/2018). The Interim Judgment was granted on 20 June 2018, based on both parties’ unreasonable behaviour.

3       It was not disputed that on 5 March 2018, the Husband moved out of the matrimonial home and took \[S\] with him without the Wife’s consent. \[S\] started Primary One in January 2018 but after he moved out with the Husband, he did not attend school from 5-8 March 2018. On 8 March 2018, I made the following urgent interim orders for: (a) the Husband to return \[S\] to the matrimonial home by 3 pm that day and for \[S\] to continue to attend school; (b) neither party to remove \[S\] from Singapore without the written consent of the other party; (c) the parties to share care and control of \[S\]; and (d) the parent whose care and control \[S\] was in was responsible for ensuring that \[S\] continued to attend school and for bringing \[S\] to his tuition and extracurricular activities (the “8 March 2018 Orders”). However, orders (b)-(d) were not complied with and \[S\] was _not_ returned to the matrimonial home. On 12 March 2018, the Wife commenced committal proceedings against the Husband (the “First Committal Proceedings”).

4       In the meantime, the parties attended mandatory counselling and mediation at the Child Focused Resolution Centre as directed. On 20 March 2018, both parties consented to the following interim orders: (a) that \[S\] would attend a play date with a friend on 21 March with the Wife present; (b) that the Husband would simply drop \[S\] off for the playdate and would not attend the play date; and (c) that the Wife would have supervised access to \[S\] once a week at the Divorce Support Specialist Agency (“DSSA”) for 8 weeks and a report would be prepared by the DSSA.

5       On 22 March 2018, the Husband filed a Summons application to set aside the 8 March 2018 Orders (Summons No. 1xxx/2018). This was subsequently withdrawn on 9 July 2018. The Husband also filed an application against the Wife for a Personal Protection Order (“PPO”) for himself and \[S\], which was withdrawn on 29 June 2018. On 8 June 2019, after hearing the First Committal Proceedings, I found that the Husband was in breach of the 8 March 2018 Orders and ordered him to pay a fine of $2,000 as well as costs of $2,000 to the Wife.

6       On 12 June 2018, the parties reached a consent order for the Husband to bring \[S\] to the premises of the Family Justice Courts that afternoon for the access handover, and the Wife would have access to \[S\] until 23 June 2018. An FJC counsellor also assisted the parties to facilitate the handover. However, on the same day, the Husband went to the matrimonial home at 11.30 pm and brought \[S\] home. On 18 June 2018, the Wife filed another Summons application seeking interim sole custody, care and control of \[S\], with supervised access to the Husband, pending the resolution of the ancillary matters (Summons No. 2xxx/2018).

7       On 20 June, with the assistance of the parties’ solicitors, a consent order was recorded for the Husband to hand over \[S\] to the Wife at 7 pm that day, and the Wife would have access to \[S\] until 24 June. However, the Wife only managed to have access to \[S\] from 21 to 24 June. The Wife then instructed her solicitors to write to the Husband’s solicitors to inform him that she would bring \[S\] home from school on 27 June, and would exercise her access until 1 July 2018. The Husband did not agree to this.

8       On 27 June 2018, both parties went to pick \[S\] up from school and a dispute occurred. Both the school counsellor and the principal had to step in to assist the parties to resolve their dispute. Subsequently, \[S\] did not attend school again on 28 and 29 June 2018. On 29 June 2018, at a case conference, I ordered that \[S\] was to be in the care of the Wife from 29 June to 3 July 2018, and that the Husband was to bring \[S\] to the Wife at 2 pm on 29 June 2018. Subsequently, when \[S\] returned to the care of the Husband, he did not attend school again on 4 July 2018.

9       On 9 July 2018, I made interim orders for: (i) the Husband’s parents or helper to hand \[S\] over to the Wife by 3pm on 9 July; (ii) the Husband not to be present at the handover; and (iii) the Wife to have care of \[S\] until further orders were made. The parties and \[S\] were also ordered to attend counselling at the DSSA and to attend the Children-In-Between Programme. As the parties had previously voluntarily attended a co-parenting programme referred by SAFE SPACE Singapore, they were also told to continue attending this programme.

10     On 13 July 2018, I further ordered that pending the conclusion of the ancillary matters, the Wife was to have interim care and control of \[S\], with supervised access to the Husband once a week at the DSSA. Fortunately, the parties were subsequently able to reach an agreement for the Husband to have unsupervised access instead and on 3 January 2019, a consent order was recorded for the Husband to have unsupervised access to \[S\] every Saturday from 10.30 am to 8 pm pending the resolution of the ancillary matters.

## The Present Appeal

11     I have set out the facts above as they are relevant to the final orders I made relating to \[S\]. I heard the ancillary matters on 11 April 2019 and reserved judgment, pending further submissions regarding specific items of jewellery which the Husband wanted the Wife to return.

12     On 14 May 2019, I made the following orders, which are now the subject of appeal by the Husband:

> (1)     The Husband and Wife shall have joint custody of \[S\] with care and control to the Wife.

> (2)     The Husband shall have the following access to \[S\]:

>> (a)       On Tuesdays, from 6 pm to 8.30 pm;

> For avoidance of doubt, the Husband’s usual access shall not apply during public holidays, school holidays, Christmas eve and Christmas Day.

> (3)     The Husband shall inform the Wife no less than one week before his June and December school holiday access if he intends to take the child overseas; and shall forward the proposed itinerary, flight and accommodation details and contact numbers to the Wife no less than one week before the proposed trip. The Wife shall hand over the child’s passport to the Husband at the start of his school holiday access and the Husband shall return the child’s passport to the Wife when he returns the child to the Wife after such access.

> (4)     When the Wife is taking the child for overseas holidays during her half of the June and December school holidays, she is to forward the proposed itinerary, flight and accommodation details and contact numbers to the Husband no less than one week before the proposed trip.

> (5)     The Husband is to hand over the child’s passport to the Wife by 19 May 2019.

> (6)     Parties are to attend DSSA counselling. In addition, the parties and the child are to attend the Children-In-Between Programme.

> (9)     The Husband shall retain the matrimonial flat at \[Property 1\] in his sole name, whereas the Wife shall retain the property at \[Property 2\] in her sole name.

> (10)     The Husband is to pay the Wife the sum of $19,300, being her share of the matrimonial assets, as follows:

>> (a)       $10,000 within 4 weeks from the date of this order;

>> (b)       $5,000 within 8 weeks from the date of this order; and

>> (c)       $4,300 within 12 weeks from the date of this order.

> (11)     Each party is to retain all other assets in their respective names.

> (12)     The Wife is to return to the Husband the items of jewellery specified in the correspondence from the Wife’s solicitors dated 2 May 2019.

> (13)     Liberty to apply.

> (14)     No order as to costs for the ancillary matters.

> (15)     Penal notice to be inserted.

### Custody, care and control of \[S\]

13     The parties agreed that they should both have joint custody of \[S\], but each party sought to have sole care and control. It is trite law that the primary consideration of the Court is the best interest of the child, and all relevant factors would be taken into account. In this particular case, I had the benefit of observing how \[S\] fared while in each party’s care and control, due to the events described above.

14     From March to June 2018, when the Husband had _de facto_ care and control, \[S\] had problems with school attendance and the Wife had difficulty getting access to \[S\] despite the court orders. This led to issues of possible parental alienation. The Husband also admitted that he had difficulty controlling and disciplining \[S\], and took a much more relaxed and indulgent approach towards parenting \[S\], compared to the Wife. In contrast, after the Wife took over care and control of \[S\] in July 2018, \[S\] seemed to do much better. The Wife was able to ensure that \[S\] had a fixed routine and provided an environment of stability for \[S\], where he attended school regularly and had regular access to the Husband.

15     I wish to briefly address some serious allegations made by the Husband regarding the Wife’s care of \[S\]. The Husband claimed that in the past, the Wife had beaten and “inflicted harsh punishments” on \[S\][^1], and that this had traumatised \[S\]. I was not convinced of the truth of these assertions as the conduct of the Husband _before_ the commencement of proceedings did not support the veracity of such statements. If the Wife had indeed been in the habit of physically abusing \[S\], I did not understand why the Husband did not alert the authorities earlier. While the Husband had filed an application for a PPO for \[S\] and himself against the Wife, this was only done on 28 March 2018, after the Wife commenced divorce proceedings against him. The Husband then withdrew the PPO application in June 2018. However, he annexed the PPO affidavits in his affidavit filed for the ancillary matters[^2], presumably to bolster his allegations. While it is often common for one spouse to disparage the other in acrimonious divorce proceedings, such conduct is not looked upon favourably by the court. In my view, it was sorely unnecessary and irrelevant for the Husband to annex all his PPO affidavits in his ancillary affidavit, especially when he had already withdrawn the PPO application prior to this.

16     The Husband repeatedly asked me to interview \[S\] and to seek his views on the parent he wished to live with. While I was conscious that in certain cases, the judicial interview of children would be helpful to ascertain their best interests, I was of the view that this was not one of them. Section 125(2) of the Women’s Charter (“the Charter”) directs the court to have regard to the wishes of a child only if “he or she is of an age to express an independent opinion”, which means that the child should be of sufficient maturity to express his/her opinions which _may_ or _may not_ be useful to the court. As observed in the Court of Appeal decision of _ZO v. ZP and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 3 SLR 647</span>, judicial interviews of children would be useful where “the children are mature enough to convey their views independently” (at \[15\]). It was recognised that there is no particular age when such judicial interview would be appropriate as different children mature sufficiently at different ages. Further, in _AZB v. AZC_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHCF 1</span>, it was also highlighted that while the judicial interview of children was an important tool the court could utilise in ascertaining the children’s best interests, it may not always be the best way to proceed, depending on the “specific circumstances” as there were “limitations to such an exercise” (at \[24\]).

17     In this particular case, I declined to interview \[S\] for the following reasons: (i) \[S\] is a young child of only 7 and as such, would not fully understand or be able to accurately articulate his views on what would or would not be in his welfare; (ii) a 7-year-old child would naturally prefer to live with a “fun” parent who would spoil him and indulge his every whim; and (iii) given the Husband’s repeated insistence that I interview \[S\] and the length of time \[S\] spent with the Husband to the exclusion of the Wife, I was concerned that \[S\] would have been coached by the Husband to express certain views about the Wife. Nevertheless, I recognised that the Husband and \[S\] shared a close bond and that \[S\] was very attached to the Husband. There was also no exceptional reason, save for the possible parental alienation issues, for me to order that the Husband only have limited or supervised access. In fact, both parties were comfortable with the Husband having overnight access to \[S\]. I therefore ordered that the Wife was to have care and control of \[S\] and the Husband to have liberal access, including half of \[S\]’s school holidays and public holidays.

18     The Wife at first raised concerns that the Husband should not be allowed to take \[S\] overseas during his access unless she accompanied them. Given the breakdown of the marriage and the state of the relationship between the parties, I found that it would be unrealistic and impractical for the Wife to accompany the Husband and \[S\] every time they went overseas. Further, to have the Wife present during every overseas holiday would affect the Husband’s bonding with \[S\]. It was also not the Wife’s case that the Husband was a flight risk and would take \[S\] back to India permanently. In the circumstances, I did not impose any travel restriction on the Husband during his access time with \[S\].

19     Both parties also wanted an order to hold \[S\]’s passport. As I granted care and control to the Wife, I ordered that \[S\]’s passport be held by her and that in the event the Husband wished to bring \[S\] overseas during his access, the Wife was to hand over \[S\]’s passport to the Husband and he was to return the passport to the Wife upon their return.

### Division of matrimonial assets

#### (I)    Whether the Wife’s property at \[Property 2\] should be excluded from the asset pool

20     The Wife purchased the property at \[Property 2\] in her sole name in October 2017, and she and \[S\] are presently residing there. It is not disputed that the Husband did not make any financial contributions towards the acquisition of this property. The Wife argued that this property should be excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets to be divided as it was purchased when the marriage was on the rocks and the Husband had nothing to do with its purchase.

21     According to section 112(10) of the Charter, an asset of “any nature” acquired by either party during the marriage is a “matrimonial asset” unless it falls within the exceptions specified in the same section, ie. a third-party gift or inheritance acquired by either party which has not been substantially improved by the other party or by both parties during the marriage. It was not the Wife’s case that the property at \[Property 2\] fell within the exceptions listed in section 112(10). Hence it would _prima facie_ be a matrimonial asset included in the pool for division. The question then was whether the Court should exercise its discretion to exclude the said property from division.

22     The Wife’s submissions cited the case of _Oh Choon v. Lee Siew Lin_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGCA 60</span>, which referred to the case of _Ong Boon Huat Samuel v. Chan Mei Lan Kristine_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] SGCA 19</span>. In _Ong Boon Huat Samuel_, although the property in question technically formed part of the pool of matrimonial assets, the Court exercised its discretion to exclude the property from division as one spouse had refused to have anything to do with the purchase of the property and placed all liabilities with respect to the property solely on the other spouse, making it strictly a “solo venture”. There were no similar circumstances in the present case.

23     The Wife’s submissions also failed to highlight that in _Oh Choon_, the Court of Appeal actually declined to exercise its discretion to exclude the property from division. Account was taken of the amount which the respondent wife ought to be taken as having contributed towards the purchase of the property “having especial regard to the fact that the appellant husband could reasonably be assumed to have utilised funds which would have been due to the respondent for her contributions to the marriage in part payment” for the property. I found that similarly, in the present case, the funds utilised by the Wife to purchase the property at \[Property 2\] would have otherwise formed part of the asset pool which would have been due to the Husband for his contributions to the marriage; and therefore there was no reason to exclude the property at \[Property 2\] from division.

#### (II)    Parties’ direct contributions towards the matrimonial home

24     It was not disputed that the matrimonial home at \[Property 1\], which was purchased in the Husband’s sole name, was valued at about $770,000 with an outstanding mortgage loan of about $523,351.42 as at June 2018. The net value of the home was therefore $246,648.58.

25     It was not disputed that the Husband had utilised Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) monies for the purpose of acquiring the matrimonial home, and the Wife had not. It was also not disputed that the Wife had transferred a cash sum of $85,200 in total to the Husband’s bank accounts towards the acquisition of the home, and that the Husband subsequently returned her the sum of $8,300. As such, the Wife asserted that her direct contribution towards the home should be $76,900. However, the Husband claimed that he had further paid the sum of $28,050 towards repayment of the Wife’s loans/debts and to purchase furniture and pay household expenses for the home; it was therefore his position that the Wife’s direct contribution was only $48,850. The Wife disagreed and submitted that she had subsequently transferred an additional $21,800 to the Husband which would have covered the repayment of such debts/loans/expenses.

26     Based on the affidavit evidence from both parties, there was no evidence to support the Husband’s assertion that he had used $28,050 of the Wife’s transferred monies to repay loans/debts. The Husband had only exhibited a few pages of his bank statements in support of his assertions, and such statements showed only some circled amounts of money being transferred “from linked SA (Savings Account) to CA (Current Account)”, without any further elaboration of what the monies were used for. I did not think that this constituted sufficient evidence that the sum of $28,050 should be deducted from the Wife’s direct contribution towards the home. In contrast, the bank statements exhibited by the Wife supported her claim that she had transferred an additional $21,800 to the Husband apart from the $85,200.

27     The amount parties spent on renovations for the matrimonial home was also disputed. The Husband claimed that he had spent $40,000 on the renovation of the kitchen and purchasing household furniture. This was disputed by the Wife who claimed that the Husband had only spent $20,000 on renovations. Unfortunately, neither party had any documentary evidence of the cost of the renovations. In any event, the Husband acknowledged that part of the monies transferred by the Wife to him had indeed been used to purchase furniture for the home; and so I considered that this would have already been included in the Wife’s direct contribution.

28     In the circumstances, I found the parties’ direct contributions towards the matrimonial home to be as follows:

#### (III)    The return of jewellery and rental income for the property at \[Property 2\]

29     The Husband claimed that he had several pieces of gold jewellery, “close to $5,500 in value”[^3], in a digital safe in the matrimonial home and that the Wife had changed the passcode to the safe without his knowledge. He sought the return of these items, as well as other jewellery he had given to the Wife as wedding gifts. I asked the parties to provide their respective positions on the return of all the items of jewellery, and they subsequently agreed that the Wife would return certain itemised jewellery to the Husband. Eventually, the only disputed item left was one gold bracelet. As the parties had both agreed that most of the items of jewellery would be returned to the Husband, I therefore ordered the same. Due to the parties’ agreement and the lack of evidence showing the value of the jewellery, I did not include these items of jewellery in the table of the parties’ assets.

30     The Wife had rented out her property at \[Property 2\] from December 2017 to January 2019; and the Husband claimed a share of the rental income. As the relevant tenancy agreement showed that a monthly rental of $2,200 was paid for the period of 13 months, the total rental collected by the Wife was $28,600. The Husband wanted the total rental collected by the Wife to be added to the pool of assets for division as he claimed that he had to incur rental himself while the Wife enjoyed the exclusive occupation of the matrimonial home during this time. The Wife in turn claimed that the Husband was not entitled to a share of the rental as he had unilaterally chosen to move out of the matrimonial home and did not pay any maintenance for \[S\] while the Wife had care and control.

31     It was not disputed that the rental income collected by the Wife was paid into her disclosed OCBC bank account or that the balance in this bank account had already been included in the Wife’s list of assets. If I were to add the rental income of $28,600 to the pool of assets, there would be double-counting as part of these monies had already been amalgamated into the pool as part of the Wife’s disclosed assets. The Husband had also not made any assertion that the Wife had kept the entire rental sum separate and distinct from the rest of her assets. As such, I did not return the sum of $28,600 to the pool. However, pursuant to section 112(2)(f) of the Charter, I took into account for the purposes of division that for the relevant period, the Wife enjoyed exclusive occupation of the matrimonial home and collected rental for her own property.

#### (IV)    The pool of other assets available for division

32     The value of the pool of matrimonial assets, other than the matrimonial home, to be divided is as follows (taking the date of the valuation of assets as the date of the ancillary matters hearing, as this was not disputed):

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="50.84%"> <col width="49.16%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Husband’s assets</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Wife’s assets</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">The property at [Property 2] = $239,482 (net value)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">CPF monies = $135,738.73</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">CPF monies = $65,409.75</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Monies in bank accounts = $3,180.63</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Monies in bank accounts = $6,457.88</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><em>Sub-total =</em> $138,919.36</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><em>Sub-total =</em> $311,349.63</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Total value of matrimonial assets = $450,268.99</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

#### (V)    Just and equitable division of the matrimonial assets

33     It is trite law that the power to divide matrimonial assets is to be exercised in broad strokes, with the court determining what is just and equitable in the circumstances of each case: _ANJ v. ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span>_._ In _TNC v. TND_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 3 SLR 1172</span>, the Honourable Debbie Ong JC, as she then was, found that there could be special circumstances justifying a different approach to the division of particular assets instead of pooling all the matrimonial assets together. One way was to use the “classification methodology” and to divide a class of assets separately from the rest of the matrimonial assets. The classification approach would be appropriate where there were “multiple classes of assets to which the parties had made different contributions and some assets were not wholly the gains of the co-operative partnership of efforts that the marriage represented”: \[39\] – \[40\]. It was also clarified that pursuant to the classification methodology, only the direct contributions could vary and the weightage accorded to indirect contributions had to remain constant in relation to each class of assets.

34     I found that in the present case, due to the difference in the parties’ direct contributions for the matrimonial home and their other assets, it would be just and equitable to use the classification method and to consider the division of the matrimonial home separately from the division of all other assets (including the Wife’s property at \[Property 2\]).

35     The structured approach set out in _ANJ v. ANK_ involves three broad steps by which the court should:

> (a)     express as a ratio the parties’ _direct contributions_ relative to each other, having regard to the amount of _financial_ contribution each party made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets (“Step 1”);

> (b)     express as a second ratio the parties’ _indirect contributions_ relative to each other, having regard to both _indirect financial_ and _non-financial_ contributions (“Step 2”); and

> (c)     derive parties’ overall contributions relative to each other by taking an average of the two ratios above, keeping in mind that, depending on the circumstances of each case, the direct and indirect contributions may not be accorded equal weight and one of the two ratios may be accorded more significance than the other (“Step 3”).

36     The Husband submitted that his percentage of indirect contributions should be calculated as 65% to the Wife’s 35%, as he had made significant financial contributions during the marriage. The Wife’s case was that her indirect contributions should be 70% to the Husband’s 30%. It was not disputed that the Husband had made significant financial contributions during the marriage, such as paying for the property tax, MCST and utilities bills for the matrimonial home. While the Wife disputed that the Husband had been paying for the main household expenses, grocery expenses and the child’s expenses and claimed that she had paid for this, I noted that the Wife was able to amass enough savings from her income to purchase her property at \[Property 2\]. In the circumstances, I accepted the Husband’s evidence that he had paid for most of the household expenses. I also noted that the Wife had done her part in the non-financial contributions and had taken care of \[S\] while juggling a full-time job. I thus apportioned the parties’ indirect contributions in the proportion of 55% to the Husband and 45% to the Wife.

37     Taking the approach in _ANJ v. ANK_, I arrived at the following:

38     As mentioned above, taking into account that the Wife had exclusive occupation of the matrimonial home for 13 months while collecting rental for her property at \[Property 2\], I was of the view that it would be just and equitable to increase the Husband’s share of the home to 70%. I was not minded however to make any adjustment to the average ratio for the other matrimonial assets. The Wife’s share of the matrimonial home therefore amounted to about $73,995 (30%). Taking into account the Husband’s 43% share of the other matrimonial assets, however, the Wife was to pay him the sum of $54,696. If the Husband wished to retain the matrimonial home, he was to pay the Wife the difference of $19,300 set off from what was due to him for his share of the other assets and I so ordered.

### Maintenance for \[S\]

39     The Wife did not claim maintenance for herself, and only sought an order for the Husband to pay the sum of $1,000 as monthly maintenance for \[S\]. The Husband instead sought an order for each party to contribute the sum of $600 monthly towards \[S\]’s maintenance, and for the parties to bear \[S\]’s educational expenses equally. Both parties work in the IT industry. The Wife earns about $5,400 per month (net), whereas the Husband’s net monthly income is $9,881.

40     The court’s jurisdiction to order a parent to pay maintenance for the benefit of his/her child in matrimonial proceedings is founded in section 127(1) of the Charter. The relevant factors which are taken into account when ascertaining maintenance for the child are set out in section 69(4) of the Charter. These factors include the financial needs of the child, the parties’ income, earning capacity and assets, present and anticipated financial position, contributions to the marriage, and standard of living during the marriage, including for a child, the manner in which he was being, and in which the parties to the marriage, expected him to be, educated or trained. It is also the responsibility of _both_ parents to provide for and maintain a child.

41     In the present case, \[S\] and the parties enjoyed a comfortable enough standard of living and \[S\] attended some extracurricular classes which were typical for school going children in Singapore. \[S\] has been residing with the Wife for the past 10 months, and \[S\]’s monthly expenses were estimated at $2,160 by the Wife (inclusive of his share of the household expenses). The Husband’s own estimate of \[S\]’s expenses was $1,206 per month. I found that a fair estimate of \[S\]’s monthly expenses was $1,400, including his share of the helper’s expenses. The parties had also employed a domestic helper during the marriage. As the Husband’s monthly income was substantially more than the Wife’s (ratio of 65:35), I was of the view that it was just and reasonable to order the Husband to pay the sum of $900 as monthly maintenance for \[S\].
