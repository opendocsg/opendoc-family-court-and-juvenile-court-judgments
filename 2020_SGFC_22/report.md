Enforcement of Maintenance – Section 71 Women’s Charter – Section 121 Women’s Charter

21 February 2020

### District Judge Goh Kiat Yi:

### Introduction

1       This is an application by the Complainant ex-Wife (“the Complainant”) against the Respondent ex-Husband (“the Respondent”) to enforce a Wife maintenance order. Having heard the evidence and submissions of both parties, I allowed the Complainant’s application and ordered the Respondent to pay the arrears of $96,000 in one lump sum on or before 10 December 2019. The Respondent has appealed and I now furnish my full grounds of decision.

### Background Facts

2       Parties divorced in 2012 with the ancillary matters resolved by way of a consent order dated 14 March 2012 (“the order”). Clause 2 of the order sets out the Respondent’s obligation to pay Wife maintenance. As the interpretation and application of this clause is central to the present dispute, it is helpful to set out clause 2 in full:

> _“2_.     _The Defendant shall pay to the Plaintiff lump sum maintenance of $240,000, such lump sum maintenance to be paid as follows:-_

>> (_a_)     _$2,000 per month into the Plaintiff’s POSB account No, \[xxx91-2\] with effect from 15_ th _March 2012, and thereafter on the 15_ th _day of every month._

>> (_b_)     _Upon the date of completion of the sale of the company known as \[B\] Pte Ltd, the Defendant shall pay to the to the Plaintiff in one lump sum the balance remaining of the said sum of $240,000 PROVIDED ALWAYS that within 5 years from the date of this Order, the entire sum of $240,000 shall be paid to the Plaintiff, irrespective of whether the company is sold.”_

3       As can be seen, the Wife maintenance order was a lump sum order with 2 key components. The first is a monthly payment of $2,000 (“the periodic payment”). The second provides that the balance is to be paid upon the date of completion of the sale of a particular company and in any case the full amount shall be paid whether the company is sold or not within 5 years of the order (“the balance payment”).

### The Complainant’s Case

4       The Complainant claims that a total sum of $96,000 remains unpaid under the order. In support of her claim, the Complainant sets out in her affidavit, a table (“the table”) which records the due date for each periodic payment due under the order, the date payments were made by the Respondent, the sum of payments and the outstanding amount as of the date of each payment.[^1] The table is supported by comprehensive bank statements of the Complainant’s designated bank account dating back to the time of the order (“the bank statements”).

### The Respondent’s Case

5       The Respondent does not dispute that there is a “shortfall” of $96,000 as gleaned from the table. However, he resists the application on 3 grounds. First, for the months of periodic payment where there were no deposits, he had made cash payments of $2,000 to the Complainant through their son (“the son”), \[C\].[^2] Second, he had paid the Complainant a lump sum of $120,000 through the son sometime in 2016.[^3] Third, the Complainant cannot in any event recover the arrears as they have accrued due more than 3 years, pursuant to Section 121 of the Women’s Charter (“WC”).[^4]

6       There are accordingly five issues to be resolved. First, whether the Respondent paid the Complainant the periodic payments in cash. Second, whether he paid her a lump sum of $120,000. Third, whether her claim is time-barred under Section 121 WC. Fourth, if her claims are time-barred, whether there are special circumstances which exist. Finally, if there are enforceable arrears, the appropriate mode of enforcement.

7       I now turn to each of these issues.

### Issue 1: Whether the Respondent paid the Complainant the Periodic Payments in cash

8       As observed above at \[4\], the only material documentary evidence before the Court are the bank statements of deposits made by the Respondent into the Complainant’s designated bank account. The burden of proof thus rests on the Respondent to show, on a balance of probabilities, that he had made the cash payments in those months where monies were not deposited. In my judgment, the Respondent has failed to satisfy this burden for the reasons that follow.

#### The Respondent’s Evidence

9       Apart from his own bare assertions, there _is no supporting evidence_ that the Respondent made cash payments to the son and that that the sources of funds came from him. For instance, he did not show that he had withdrawn cash sums of $2,000 from his own bank accounts during those periods which may support his contention that he paid cash to the Complainant through the son.

10     The Respondent also had no supporting evidence to prove that the Complainant had agreed to such cash payments, or that he had instructed the son to transfer the said sums to the Complainant. Crucially, none of the purported conversations he allegedly had with the Complainant raised during the trial[^5] were mentioned in any of his affidavits. This was a material omission.

11     There are also other significant inconsistencies in the Respondent’s evidence. The Respondent only raised the allegation of periodic payments to the son of $2,000 in his reply affidavit.[^6] This was presumably after he had sight of the Complainant’s table of the dates of which payments were not deposited.[^7] It was not his evidence at the outset that he paid any cash through the son apart from the $120,000 lump sum.

12     The Respondent had also only raised during the trial that had paid cash because of insufficient funds in his accounts resulting in unsuccessful GIRO deductions. [^8] This reason was not mentioned in any of his affidavits. In any event, the Respondent did not provide any evidence that the giro deductions were unsuccessful or his bank account was low on funds at the material times to support his contention. These documents are well within his custody, power or possession.

13     It appeared from the foregoing that the Respondent was simply making his case as he went along.

#### The Son’s Evidence

14     The son was called by the Complainant as a witness and he gave evidence on the issue of periodic payments stating clearly that that he was aware that the Complainant was not paid on certain months.[^9] This stood in sharp contrast with the Respondent’s assertions. The Respondent’s counsel did not take issue with the son’s evidence in written submissions. Instead, it was only when probed by the court during the oral hearing that counsel sought to impugn the son’s evidence as self-serving given the concurrent DC suit against him for the recovery of $120,000.[^10]

15     I found no merit in counsel’s belated submissions. Having observed the son’s demeanour and also the responses he gave on the stand, I considered him to be a truthful witness. First, counsel did not refer to any part of the transcript nor his affidavit where there were inconsistencies. Second, the son answered the questions clearly and did not embellish his evidence. When cross-examined on the periodic payments, the son did not readily say that the Complainant would inform him every time there was default. Instead, his evidence was that the mother would verbally inform him sometimes in general.[^11] This was understandable as the events took place years ago between and it was more likely that the mother would have complained to the son of the Father’s non-payment from time to time.

16     I also rejected counsel’s suggestion that the son’s evidence should be accorded minimal weight due to his own interest in defending the DC suit (filed by the Respondent for the claim of the lump sum payment of $120,000) as he was not cross-examined on this point. In any event, such an allegation cannot be accepted simply because there is a concurrent suit concerning the same subject matter. The son is expected as a matter of course to adopt the same position but this did not mean his evidence would _per se_ be unreliable.

#### The Mother’s Evidence

17     As for the Complainant, I too found her to be a truthful witness and I disagreed with the Respondent’s submissions to the contrary.

18     Respondent’s counsel relies on a WhatsApp message dated 7 September 2016 in his submission that the Complainant has mislead the court about the actual amounts which she had received and is critical to show that she is unreliable. In this WhatsApp message, she stated the amounts owing was $146,000 whereas based on the table, the amount at that time (September 2016) should have been $152,000.

19     I disagreed with this submission for three reasons. First, the Complainant was not specifically cross-examined on this point – why the arrears was stated as $146,000 in the WhatsApp message instead of $152,000. She was thus not offered an opportunity to explain this discrepancy. Second, the inconsistent tabulation of the arrears is not surprising given that both parties appeared not to have kept a detailed tabulation of the arrears all the time. This was indeed the Complainant’s position.[^12] The Respondent himself was also not keeping track of payments since it is also his own case that he had overpaid her.[^13]

20     Third, this purported inconsistency also works against the Respondent as it also proves that he was in arrears in paying the monthly instalments of $2,000 at that point. If the Respondent had paid cash, the arrears stated by the Complainant in the WhatsApp message (assuming he had paid the 9 instalments) would have been $134,000 instead of $146,000. To illustrate, the purported inconsistency on the part of the Complainant would only be $152,000 - $146,000 = $6,000 (equivalent to 3 months) as opposed to $146,000 - $134,000 = $12,000 (equivalent to 6 months) on the part of the Respondent. It was therefore more likely than not that he did not make payments in cash and I did not see how the WhatsApp message of 7 September 2016 could assist him.

21     Counsel also suggested that the Complainant was inconsistent, as she had only claimed arrears of $6,000 in her complaint form. On this issue, I accepted the Complainant’s explanation on the stand that this was her first time filing such an application and due to her miscommunication with the registry staff that she only claimed for the recent months in default. This can be gleaned from the following exchange during cross-examination[^14]:

> _“Q:_      _… can you confirm the counter staff.. Did they ask you to calculate? What was the total maintenance arrears owed to you?_

> _A:_      _They did not ask me._

> _Q:_      _Then, what did they ask you?_

> _A:_      _They asked me how many months in arrears._

> _Q:_      _Alright, What was your answer?_

> _A:_      _I said from the year 2018 until December, three --- in any case 3 to 4 months no payment. They didn’t ask me the period prior to that neither did I say, that’s why miscommunication…”_

Indeed, the 3 to 4 months non-payment identified by the Complainant is entirely consistent with the number of missing payments from January 2018 as shown in the table.

22     Ultimately, it is for the Respondent to discharge the burden of proof that he had made the cash payments but can only support his case by his own verbal assertions. It is plainly the Respondent’s responsibility to comply with all the terms of the maintenance order including the mode of payment. There is no reason why he should have paid cash especially since the order of court obliges him to pay into the Complainant’s bank account and he has in fact done so for most of the months. Further, this was not the case where the cash was allegedly passed to the Complainant but to the son, a third party. There is also no evidence that these monies were eventually collected by the Complainant from the son. Indeed, the Respondent also acknowledged at trial that the son had no authority to accept payments on the mother’s behalf.[^15]

23     For the foregoing reasons, I could not accept that the Respondent had made the periodic payments in cash.

### Issue 2: Whether the Respondent paid the Complainant a lump sum of $120,000.

24     I now turn to the alleged lump sum payment of $120,000. The Respondent alleges that this was a sum he paid to the son on instruction that it be transferred to the mother as payments for maintenance. The son’s position is that this sum was transferred to him as a gift for the purchase of a car back in 2016. Like the cash payments, it was for the Respondent to prove that he had paid the Complainant and I likewise find that he has failed to discharge the burden.

25     First, there is _no evidence_ – receipts, letters, correspondence or verification of any kind that the amount of $120,000 transferred to the son was meant for the Complainant. As compared to the $2,000 monthly quantum in cash, this was a significant sum of monies and there would have been at least some form of documentation if he did not want to pay the Complainant directly into her bank account. By his own account, he claims that he did so because he was no longer on talking terms with the Complainant.[^16] If this was the case presumably because of conflict between him and the Complainant, it would have been unlikely that he would risk a transferring such a huge sum to the son, a third party, without any records.

26     Second, if the $120,000 were truly meant for maintenance, it would have fully satisfied his obligations in 9 months or so after the payment based on the table of arrears. However, he continued to pay the Complainant $2,000 monthly maintenance until December 2018 which was some two and a half years or 30 months thereafter or 30 months. Whilst I have observed above at \[19\] that both parties did not keep track of the payments made, the payments of which lasted 21 months (being 30 less 9) more than what he was obliged to pay was a significant amount of time. He could not have paid for such an extended period if he truly believed that the $120,000 was for maintenance.

27     Third, the WhatsApp message sent by the Complainant in September 2019 stated that the arrears was $146,000.[^17] This was around 3 months after the $120,000 was paid in June 2016. However, the Respondent did not reply. If he did in fact pay $120,000 to the son, the Respondent would certainly have challenged the accuracy of her tabulation at the material time as the amount would be largely different.

28     Fourth, the Respondent only raised belatedly during the trial, that he had paid the sum into the son’s account instead of directly to the Complainant because of the lower banking charges. This was never raised in his affidavits. This reason also contradicts his own affidavit where he says that he only made the payment to the son as he was not on talking terms with the Complainant during that period.[^18] The WhatsApp message tendered by the Complainant casted significant doubts on even the latter assertion, as it showed that parties were still in communication then. In any event, the Respondent’s excuse to avoid bank charges was a bad one as such a large sum should have been deposited directly to her account.

29     The Complainant was also cross-examined as to why she continued to accept $2,000 from April 2017 onwards, I accepted her explanation that party’s relationship was amicable at that time and she did not want to make things awkward.[^19] This was consistent with her position throughout the proceedings.[^20]

30     Respondent’s counsel submits that it flies in the face of logic for the Respondent to have gifted the son $120,000 when he was still under a maintenance obligation of more than that sum at the material time. I do not see the merit in this argument as it is his own argument that there is trust and confidence between Father and son, indicating a continuing positive relationship between them.[^21] Next such conduct by the Respondent is not surprising as he also admitted that when he received a huge sum from the sale of the company, he used the monies to settle some of his other financial commitments such as his own housing loan. [^22] This shows his propensity to prioritise other payments over the maintenance payments.

31     Next, the Respondent also accepts that the son had no authority to accept the payment of $120,000 as maintenance, and there is no evidence that these monies eventually found their way to the Complainant. This amount is indeed subject to a DC suit for recovery of monies commenced by the Respondent against the son.

32     Finally, it is also unclear why the Respondent considered $120,000 to be an appropriate sum to pay for the arrears. This was not the total amount of maintenance outstanding as of June 2016 based on the table and it was unlikely that he would have made such an significant payment without first checking what was the remaining arrears owing at the time.

33     For the foregoing reasons, I found that the Respondent did not pay the Complainant $120,000 and the total amount of arrears thus stands at $96,000 as reflected in the table.

### Issue 3: Whether the Complainant’s claim is time-barred under Section 121 Women’s Charter.

34     I now turn to the Respondent’s defence that the claims are in any event time-barred under Section 121 of the WC. Section 121(3) provides that:

> _“No amount owing as maintenance be recoverable in any suit if it accrued due more than 3 years before the institution of the suit unless the court, under special circumstances, otherwise allows.”_

35     The Respondent argues that the Complainant only filed her application on 7 March 2019. This would mean that she could not claim the periodic payments which were in arrears for the earlier months based on the table, [^23] and the balance sum as the company’s factory and machinery were sold on 24 March 2015.[^24] The Complainant submits that the company was in fact never sold, or in any event, the accrual of the action would only be on the lapse of the “long stop” date of 14 March 2017 based on the proviso in clause 2(b).[^25]

36     I accepted the Complainant’s counsel’s submissions that the time bar would only run after the long stop date in clause 2(b). It important to note that clause 2 of the order of court is in substance a lump sum maintenance order and not a monthly maintenance order. The first line of the entire clause 2 states “The Defendant shall pay to the Plaintiff _lump sum maintenance_ of $240,000, such _lump sum_ to be paid as follows” (_emphasis_ added).

37     Clause 2b then states unequivocally - “PROVIDED ALWAYS that within 5 years from the date of the Order, the entire sum of $240,000 shall be paid to the Plaintiff, irrespective of whether the company is sold” (emphasis original). In my judgement, this proviso was a catch-all clause which provided parties a clear reference point in time for the full sum of $240,000 to be paid. In other words, I was of the view that the proviso would be the governing clause on which both parties intended that the entire lump sum arrears would accrue. The time bar for payment of the entire lump sum thus would run from 14 March 2017, which means that the Complainant did not fall afoul of the Section 121 time bar when she filed her application on 7 March 2019.

#### Time-bar for the Balance Payment

38     Even if I was wrong on the foregoing analysis, clause 2(b) of the court order also states that the balance is to be paid _on completion of the sale of the company_. However, the Respondent who seeks to rely on the time-bar does not provide any documents pertaining to the sale of the company and only states in his reply affidavit that the sale of the company’s factory and accompanying machinery was completed on 24 March 2015.[^26] However there is no evidence led on the actual sale of the company itself of which the obligation to pay accrued. The company is in law a separate entity from the factory and machinery.

39     In this regard, I note that the son, who had assisted in the sale, gave evidence that after the sale of the factory and assets there were audits in the months to come, and the process until the closing of the company lasted into 2016.[^27] The Respondent also revealed during cross-examination that he received $2,000,000 for his 7.5% share sometime in November 2015.[^28] Thus, even on the facts, he only received the substantial bulk of funds from the company later on and not in March 2015 when the company factory and machinery were sold**.** Further, the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) documents submitted by the Complainant shows that the company itself was only struck off and not sold with a status date of 4 April 2016.

40     Based on the plain reading of the court order, the Respondent could not rely on the 24 March 2015 date as the commencement of the time-bar. If at all, the only clear date on evidence would be 4 April 2016 when the company was struck off. This would mean that the time-bar did not apply or in the best case, would only run from 4 April 2016 if the striking off the company could be equated with the sale of the company. This would therefore mean that the Complainant’s application filed on 7 March 2019 did not fall afoul of Section 121.

41     I did not accept Respondent’s submissions that a subjective interpretation of the Court order should be taken as the plain reading of the order is very clear. In any case, even if a subjective meaning was to be taken, it is important that sufficient evidence must be presented as to the subjective intention of parties _at the time the consent order_ was entered into – that they had intended the sale of the factory and machinery to equivalent to the sale of the company. I did not accept that just because the Complainant herself had later on considered the sale of the factory to be equated to the sale meant she had such an understanding at the time of the consent order.

42     It entirely reasonable for the Complainant to believe whatever was communicated to her, by her parents-in-law, son or the Respondent that the company was sold notwithstanding the plain reading of the order.[^29] This is because such information would be entirely within the knowledge of the Respondent or his family and she could only have relied on their representations in her belief that the company had been sold as of mid-2015 when in fact it was not.

#### Time-bar for the Period Payments

43     As for the assertion that the periodic payments of $2,000 under clause 2(a) of the order (“pre-sales arrears”) were time-barred, I agreed with the Complainant’s submission above that the time bar only accrued with effect from the sale of the company or the long stop date as the order for the reasons given at \[36\] and \[37\] above.

44     Even if the foregoing interpretation was wrong, the pre-sales arrears would not be in breach of the time-bar, as subsequent monthly instalment payments could be treated as payment of the earlier arrears. By way of illustration using the table, the payments on 16 May 2012 and 16 June 2012 can be regarded as payments for the obligations of 15 March 2012 and 15 April 2012 respectively and thereon. As there are a total of 11 months of shortfall as of December 2018 and 11 months of payment between January 2018 and the last payment in April 2019, the latter 11 months payment would have covered the 11 months shortfall. This means that the cause of action for non-payment of the first instalment would have accrued from January 2018. This meant that the Complainant’s application was well within the time-bar period.

45     In a similar vein, it is clear that the Respondent continued to pay $2,000 consistently until December 2018. This would be akin to part payments made under a civil claim for debt under Section 26(2) of the Limitation Act which provides:

> _“Where any right of action has accrued to recover any debt or other liquidated pecuniary claim… the person liable or accountable therefor acknowledges the claim or makes any payment in respect of, the right shall be deemed to have accrued on and not before the date of the acknowledgement or the last payment.” (emphasis added)_

46     Although the Limitation Act does not apply in the present case, I was of the view that in principle, his continued payments of $2,000 could be taken as an acknowledgement of the debt, and thus the cause of action would only have accrued more recently from the last part payment. This would, also in any event, be relevant for the assessment of special circumstances which I now turn to.

### Issue 4: Whether there are Special Circumstances

47     As noted in the parliamentary debates highlighted in _Meenatchi d/o Kuppusamy v Sybbiah Pillai_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGDC 202</span>, the reason for the inclusion of special circumstances was that the Wife may have _genuine reasons_ not to apply for recovery of arears before the expiry of three years. [^30]

48     The High Court also held in _Koay Guat Kooi v Eddie Yeo_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] SGHC 197</span> at \[12\] that special circumstances does not mean exceptional circumstances nor unusual circumstances. It must mean circumstances, which are sufficiently persuasive in themselves that to ignore them would to do great injustice to the Wife. I note further that there are examples in the case law where special circumstances have been established generally involved circumstances where the Wife tried to contact the Husband but the Husband had been evading contact. However, these examples are not meant to be exhaustive.

49     In the present case, although the Complainant’s counsel conceded during the oral hearing that there were no special circumstances, I was of the view that there are special circumstances in the present case. This is so for the reasons that follow.

50     First, the full outstanding amount should have been fully paid by 15 March 2015 as he had claimed, or by 4 April 2016 when the company was struck off or in any event latest by 13 March 2017 which was 5 years after the order. However, the Respondent plainly failed to do so as I have found above. Instead, he continued paying Complainant $2,000 pursuant to clause 2(a) of the order. The text messages in March 2016 to April 2017 show that the Complainant has been asking him for lump sum repayment. I also accepted the Complainant’s evidence that the delay was due to the Respondent wanting to use monies to pay off his own housing mortgage which he did not deny.[^31]

51     As I found above at \[29\]. It was due to the Complainant’s patience that she permitted him to continue the periodic $2,000 payments until things came to a head sometime in February 2019, when the Respondent represented to her that he would stop paying anymore maintenance.[^32] This was what ultimately prompted the Complainant to seek the court’s assistance to enforce full payment of the arrears.

52     Although this was not a case where Respondent was un-contactable and evasive, the fact that the Complainant did not enforce the full amount earlier is understandable because he continued to pay her the $2,000. This was an acknowledgement that further arrears were due and owing. In my judgment, this amounts to special circumstances, as it would have led the Complainant to believe he would eventually fulfil his overarching obligation. Indeed the Complainant herself had recognised “_that is why for so many years, I did not come to court to initiate enforcement application against him_”.[^33]

53     This was in my view not a case which Section 121 is intended to capture – Complainants who drag their feet and make belated claims for enforcement. The present situation was not that the Respondent had ceased payment her for a long time but rather he paid her consistently almost every month until December 2018. It comes as no surprise that she expeditiously filed the application a few months later on 7 March 2019.

54     In the final analysis, I did not think that the Respondent should be allowed to escape from his obligations under a consent order of court, simply because of the Complainant’s patience in not enforcing the full sum at an earlier stage. It would be in my view unjust to her if this were the case.

55     In summary therefore, I found that the outstanding sum of $96,000 remains due and enforceable.

### Issue five: Mode of Enforcement

56     I turn now to the mode of enforcement. As this is the Complainant’s first enforcement application, I was of the view that no penal sanctions should be imposed on the Respondent. As his ability to pay was not put in issue and in any event, he received over $2,000,000 in November 2015[^34], I ordered him to pay up the outstanding arrears in one lump sum in two weeks, on or before 10 December 2019 into the Complainant’s designated bank account.

## Costs

57     Having substantially found in favour of the Complainant, costs should follow the event. Considering inter alia, the complexity of the matter, the number and length of affidavits filed and the time required for hearing, I ordered the Respondent to pay the Complainant costs fixed at $5,000 (excluding disbursements).
