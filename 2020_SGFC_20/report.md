Family Law – Section 121C of the Women’s Charter – Jurisdiction - Domicile

17 February 2020

### District Judge Lo Wai Ping:

## Introduction

1       The Plaintiff (“**Wife**”) and the Defendant (“**Husband**”) were married in Brunei in 1985. In 2018, the Husband commenced divorce proceedings in the Syariah Subordinate Court in Brunei (“**Brunei Syariah Court**”). The Husband had converted to Islam in 2017 in Brunei.

2       Pursuant to an order of the Brunei Syariah Court (with effect from 13 September 2018), the marriage between the parties was dissolved (“**Dissolution Order**”). The Dissolution Order was accepted by both parties as binding on them.

3       On 23 July 2019, by way of an application, OSF No. 58 of 2019 filed in the Family Justice Courts in Singapore (the “**Application**”), the Wife applied for leave of court to be granted under section 121D (1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353) (“**the Charter**”) for her to file an application against the Husband for an order for financial relief under Chapter 4A of the Charter (“**Financial Relief Order**”). The Wife was represented by counsel whilst the Husband appeared in person.

4       Under section 121D (2) of the Charter, the Singapore court shall not grant leave unless it considers that there is substantial ground for the making of an application for the Financial Relief Order.

5       However, the preliminary issue before me was whether the applicant Wife had satisfied the jurisdictional requirements prescribed in section 121C of the Charter.

6       Under Section 121C, the Singapore court shall have jurisdiction to hear an application for a Financial Relief Order only if –

> (a)     one of the parties to the marriage was domiciled in Singapore on the date of the application for leave under Section 121D or was so domiciled on the date on which the divorce, annulment or judicial separation obtained in a foreign country took effect in that country, or

> (b)     one of the parties to the marriage was habitually resident in Singapore for a continuous period of one year immediately preceding the date of the application for leave under section 121D or was so resident for a continuous period of one year immediately preceding the date on which the divorce, annulment or judicial separation obtained in a foreign country took effect in that country.

7       After hearing the parties, I found that the Wife had not satisfied the jurisdictional requirements set out in section 121C and therefore, I dismissed the Application and declined to grant leave for the Wife to file an application for a Financial Relief Order. I held that neither the Wife nor the Husband was domiciled in Singapore on the effective date of the Dissolution Order or on the date of the Application (I shall refer to these two dates collectively as the “**Relevant Dates**” and to each, as a “**Relevant Date**”). The Wife appealed against my decision and I set out below the reasons for my decision.

## Background

8       By way of background information, I will first set out the facts below:

> (a)     The parties were both born in Brunei and they lived and grew up in Brunei. The Wife was a permanent resident of Brunei. According to the Wife, the Husband was stateless. The parties were married in Brunei in 1985. The Wife was then 18 years old and working as a secretary and the Husband was then 26 years old and working as an engineer.

> 1988 to 1992

> (b)     In 1988, the parties moved to Singapore. The Husband found work as a lecturer at a polytechnic in Singapore. In 1989, the Wife gave birth to 2 sons, one in January and the other in December. She did not work while in Singapore and was a homemaker looking after the 2 sons. The Husband went into the kitchenware business in 1989 after he stopped teaching at the polytechnic. In 1992, the parties acquired Singapore citizenship. The following year (1993), the parties went back to Brunei together with their 2 sons. At this time, the Wife was about 27 years old; the Husband was about 34 years old. While in Singapore from 1988 to 1993, the parties did not own any real property in Singapore.

> 1993 to 2006

> (c)     After the parties returned to Brunei, the Wife re-registered herself as a permanent resident of Brunei. She was to have 2 more sons who were born in Brunei in 1996 and 1998. All the 4 sons were registered as Singapore citizens and they were all brought up in Brunei. They also completed their secondary school education in Brunei.

> (d)     On or about 2006, the first two sons, then about 17 years of age, came over to Singapore to pursue their polytechnic education. This was about 13 years after the parties had left Singapore in 1993. From 1993 to around 2006, the parties and their 4 sons lived in Brunei. Sometime in 2006, the Husband bought a HDB flat in Singapore (“**Singapore Flat**”). The Singapore Flat was registered under his sole name and the Singapore Flat was the only real property of the Husband in Singapore. The Wife did not at any time own any real property in Singapore.

> (e)     After completing their polytechnic education, the first 2 sons went on to perform their national service obligations. Thereafter, they remained in Singapore and worked in Singapore. The eldest son is working in sales and the second son is a pilot in the Republic of Singapore air force. The third and the fourth sons also followed the same path as their older siblings except that the third son was exempted from national service as he was autistic and he did not complete his polytechnic education. The third son returned to Brunei in 2016 and has been residing in Brunei under the Wife’s care. As for the youngest son, he completed his national service in 2019 and had intended to pursue his further studies in Singapore. The youngest son had embraced Islam in January 2016.

> 2006 to 2018

> (f)     From 2006 to 2018 (a period of another 12 years) the parties continued to reside outside of Singapore notwithstanding the purchase of the Singapore Flat. During this period, they did make short visits to Singapore, on business or to visit their sons in Singapore who were studying, working and or performing their national service in Singapore. From 2011 to 2017, the Husband was working on a project for the Brunei Cancer Centre. While the parties were living in Brunei, the Husband had bought a house in Brunei and gifted the house to the Wife. The house was sold in 2011 and the sale proceeds were kept by the Wife. In addition, the Wife also had several cars registered under her name in Brunei.

> Divorce Proceedings in Brunei commenced in 2017

> (g)     When the marriage broke down, the Wife had initially filed for divorce at the High Court of Brunei on 18 October 2017. This was after the parties had signed a settlement agreement dated 16 October 2017 relating _inter alia_, to the transfer of the Singapore Flat to her own name (the “**Settlement Agreement**”). The Settlement Agreement was prepared by Bruneian lawyers and the parties agreed to the laws of Brunei as the governing law. The parties also agreed to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of Brunei. At the relevant time, the parties were residing in Brunei and had been residing there since they left Singapore in 1993. The divorce proceedings commenced in the High Court of Brunei were heard in May 2018. As the Husband had converted to Islam on 18 October 2017, the High Court of Brunei held that it did not have the requisite jurisdiction to hear the divorce proceedings.

> (h)     In the same month, May 2018, after the decision of the High Court of Brunei referred to in sub-paragraph (g) above, the Husband commenced proceedings at the Brunei Syariah Court for the dissolution of their marriage. This was on the ground that the Wife had refused to convert to Islam after the Husband had done so. The Husband appeared in person at these proceedings, whilst the Wife was present with her lawyers. The Dissolution Order issued by the Brunei Syariah Court came into effect on 13 September 2018. It stated that the Brunei Syariah Court had made the Dissolution Order after it had heard and examined “the Application and the evidence of the parties” and was “satisfied with it”. The Brunei Syariah Court did not, in its Dissolution Order, make any orders as to spousal maintenance or the division of the matrimonial assets or any other ancillary matters despite the pleadings and evidence of the parties before it. In her counterclaim, the Wife had sought for more than what she had earlier agreed to in the Settlement Agreement. She had sought for an order that the Husband pay her a sum of $300,000 as “a compensation and matrimonial property of the marriage” between them. She had also sought for monthly sums of maintenance from him for their third and fourth sons including separate orders that the Husband was also to pay for their school and educational expenses in full. To incorporate all her new claims, her lawyers submitted _a draft of a new settlement agreement_ to the Brunei Syariah Court. The Husband did not agree with the terms of the new settlement agreement proposed by her lawyers and had presented to the Court his evidence and reasons for this. In the original Settlement Agreement entered into in October 2017, the Wife had agreed not to seek any further maintenance from the Husband with the transfer of the Singapore Flat to her.

9       I turn now to the jurisdictional issue before me.

## JURISDICTION ISSUE

10     The issue was whether, on any of the Relevant Dates, either party was:

> (a)     domiciled in Singapore, or

> (b)     habitually resident in Singapore for a continuous period of one (1) year immediately preceding any of the Relevant Dates.

11     Based on the evidence of the parties, neither the Husband nor the Wife was habitually resident in Singapore for a continuous period of 1 year prior to any of the Relevant Dates. It was also noted that neither the Husband nor the Wife took the position that he or she had fulfilled these requirements of habitual residence set out in section 121C of the Charter.

12     As for the issue of domicile, the parties took different positions. The Wife’s position was that she acquired a domicile of choice in Singapore when she moved to Singapore in 1988 and became a citizen of Singapore in 1992. As for the Husband, his position was that both he and the Wife were domiciled in Brunei notwithstanding the acquisition of their Singapore citizenship in 1992.

13     In support of her position on domicile, the Wife also relied on the presumption set out in Section 3(5) of the Charter (“**Section 3(5)**”) which stated as follows

> “_For the purposes of this Act, a person who is a citizen of Singapore shall be deemed, until the contrary is proved, to be domiciled in Singapore_.”

14     However, whilst Section 3(5) operated as a statutory deeming provision in that for the purposes of the Charter, a citizen of Singapore shall be deemed to be domiciled in Singapore, this deeming provision could nevertheless be rebutted as it expressly provided that it applied “_until the contrary is proved_”.

15     Prima facie, by the operation of Section 3(5), the domicile requirements set out in Section 121C of the Charter would have been satisfied as both parties were citizens of Singapore on the Relevant Dates.

16     However, as mentioned above, the statutory deeming provision in Section 3(5) could be rebutted based on the evidence placed before this court. As the Husband’s position was that both he and the Wife were not domiciled in Singapore and were domiciled in Brunei on the Relevant Dates, there was therefore an issue before this court for determination as to whether the Wife was in fact domiciled in Brunei as alleged by the Husband, based on the common law conflicts of laws in Singapore and the evidence of the parties. It was noted that the parties were not born in Singapore and had obtained Singapore citizenship by registration when they were adults. If this court determined that under Singapore’s conflicts of laws, the parties were domiciled in Brunei on the Relevant Dates, the said determination would override the deeming provision in Section 3(5) and the domicile requirements under Section 121C of the Charter would not have been satisfied.

## Domicile

17     As stated by the High Court in the case of **Peters Roger May** v **Pinder Lillian Gek Lian** \[2009\] 3 SLR (R) 765 (the “**_Peters Roger May Case No. 2_**”) at \[15\]:

> “_The concept of domicile under Singapore law is based on the traditional concept of domicile in English law. No person can be without a domicile. The origin of this rule lies in the need to connect any person with a particular legal system by which a number of legal relationships may be governed. It follows that a person cannot have more than one domicile at any given time …”_

18     Based on the evidence, the parties were born in Brunei and they grew up in Brunei and lived in Brunei before they relocated to Singapore in 1988. As submitted by the Wife, her domicile of origin was Brunei and whilst no evidence was given by the Husband as to his domicile of origin, his position was that he was domiciled in Brunei.

19     As was pointed out by the High Court in **Wong Phui Lun Joseph** v **Yeoh Loon Goit** <span class="citation">\[1978\] SGHC 7</span> at \[18\]: “_Clear evidence is required to establish a change of domicile. In particular, to displace the domicile of origin in favour of a domicile of choice, the standard of proof goes beyond a mere balance of probabilities (per Sir Jocelyn Simon P in Henderson v Henderson \[1965\] 1 All ER 179 at 181).”._ The same point was also reiterated by the High Court in the other case of **Peters Roger May** v **Pinder Lillian Gek Lian** \[2006\] 2 SLR (R) 381 (the “**_Peters Roger May Case No. 1_**”) at \[para 15\]: “… _Typically, more cogent evidence is required to prove the change of a domicile of origin than one domicile of choice to another…”._

20     On the issue of domicile of choice, I refer to guidance provided by the High Court in **Peters Roger May Case No. 2** at \[18\] to \[20\] as follows:

> _“18_      _The classic statement on domicile of choice is that of Lord Westbury in Udny v Udny (\[16\] supra) at 458_:

>> _Domicil of choice is a conclusion or inference which the law derives from the fact of a man fixing voluntarily his sole or chief residence in a particular place, with an intention of continuing to reside there for an unlimited time. This is a description of the circumstances which create or constitute a domicil, and not a definition of the term. There must be a residence freely chosen, and not prescribed or dictated by any external necessity, such as the duties of office, the demands of creditors, or the relief from illness; and it must be residence fixed not for a limited period of particular purpose, but general and indefinite in its future contemplation. It is true that residence originally temporary, or intended for a limited period, may afterwards become general and unlimited, and in such a case so soon as the change of purpose, or animus manendi, can be inferred the fact of domicil is established._

> _19_      _A domicile of choice is acquired by the combination of residence and intention of permanent or indefinite residence, but not otherwise: Dicey, Rule 10 at para 6R-033 (at para 6–034):_

>> **_Residence_** _. For the purpose of this Rule ‘residence’ means very little more than physical presence._

>> _It was held in Inland Revenue Commissioners v Duchess of Portland \[1982\] Ch 31 at 318–319 that:_

>>> _Residence in a country for the purposes of the law of domicile is physical presence in that country as an inhabitant of it._

>> _The length of residence is not important in itself but only as evidence of the animus manendi, ie, the intention to reside permanently or indefinitely in that country. Thus, if a person intends to reside in a country for a fixed period only, he lacks the animus manendi, however long that period may be (cf, The Attorney General v Lady Rowe (1862) 1 H & C 31; 158 ER 789 and the majority view in Eilon v Eilon 1965 (1) SA 703)._

> _20_      _In Morgan v Cilento \[2004\] EWHC 188 (Ch), Justice Lewison said:_

>> _9_.     _Thus the two components necessary to establish a domicile of choice are (1) voluntary residence as an inhabitant rather than as a casual visitor; and (2) an intention to remain indefinitely._

>> _10_.     _In I.R.C. v. Bullock <span class="citation">\[1976\] 1 W.L.R. 1178</span> Buckley L.J explained the nature of the intention required. He said:_

>>> _I do not think that it is necessary to show that the intention to make a home in the new country is irrevocable or that the person whose intention is under consideration believes that for reasons of health or otherwise he will have no opportunity to change his mind. In my judgment, the true test is whether he intends to make his home in the new country until the end of his days unless and until something happens to make him change his mind._

>> _11_.     _I should also add that it is possible for a person to have two homes, each in a different territory. In that event, the relevant inquiry is which of the residences is the chief residence.”_

21     Based on the Wife’s first affidavit, the Husband was stateless and “_due to the \[Husband’s\] tenuous residential status in Brunei, we decided to seek greener pastures and moved to Singapore in 1988_”. I noted that there was no mention by the Wife in her first affidavit that the parties moved over to Singapore in 1988 with the intention, at that time, to permanently reside in Singapore. Likewise, in the counterclaim filed by the Wife in 2018 in response to the proceedings filed in the Brunei Syariah Court for the dissolution of her marriage with the Husband (the “**Counterclaim**”), the Wife did not mention that the parties had intended to reside permanently in Singapore when she moved to Singapore in 1988 and acquired Singapore citizenship in 1992.

22     I also noted that shortly after the parties obtained their Singapore citizenship in 1992, they left for Brunei the following year and up to the date of the Dissolution Order, they had lived in Brunei for the next 25 years.

23     In fact, upon her return to Brunei in 1993, the Wife applied for her permanent resident status in Brunei to be reinstated. The parties went on to set up home in Brunei with 2 more sons born in 1996 and 1998. A house was bought in Brunei by the Husband and gifted to the Wife. All the 4 children were brought up and completed their secondary school education in Brunei. Prior to 2006 (when the first 2 sons came back to Singapore to pursue their education in the polytechnic), there was no evidence of any connection with Singapore. As explained by the Wife, the parties had moved back to Brunei in 1993 as the Husband had wanted to start his kitchenware business. The Husband was later also involved in an electrical engineering business up to around 2011 and thereafter, from 2011 to 2017, he worked as a consultant biomedical engineer for a project at the Brunei Cancer Centre.

24     From 1988 to 2006, the parties did not own any property in Singapore. It was only in 2006 that the Husband purchased the Singapore Flat. Based on the Wife’s evidence, she had advised the Husband to purchase a flat in Singapore so that the children would have a place to stay during their studies. In the Counterclaim, the Wife also said that she had advised the Husband to purchase the Singapore Flat as an investment for their future and their children’s future. There was no mention that the Singapore Flat was purchased in connection with any intention on their part to permanently reside in Singapore. As for the Husband, he explained that he had bought the Singapore Flat as the children were coming over to Singapore for their polytechnic education. He also pointed that as his children had national service commitments to discharge, he would be required to post a bond should the children be studying outside of Singapore. Therefore, the children continued their post-secondary school education in Singapore and he purchased the Singapore Flat for them to stay.

25     In her first affidavit, the Wife said that she told the Husband to purchase the Singapore Flat so that that would also be the place where they would retire. Even if it was accepted that there was such communication by the Wife to the Husband, it would have taken place around 2006, more than 13 years after they had left Singapore with their Singapore passports and while they were resident in Brunei. During this period and for the next 13 years up to the hearing of the Application, the parties would remain resident outside of Singapore although they did make short visits to Singapore for work or other purposes.

26     In the Wife’s second affidavit (made in reply to the Husband’s affidavit that she did not meet the domicile requirements under Section 121C of the Charter), the Wife had affirmed that she intended for Singapore to be her permanent home. She said that she had intentions to move back to Singapore permanently to be close to her sons, especially so after her marriage was dissolved in 2018 and she wanted to make a fresh start. Again, even if such statement of intention on the part of the Wife was accepted as truthful, it should be noted that this bare statement of intention to move back to Singapore would be after the Dissolution Order in 2018, or at best when the Settlement Agreement was entered into in 2017. As in the case of her intention formed during the purchase of the Singapore Flat in 2006, this statement of her intention would be formed around 2017 or 2018 when the parties were still residing in Brunei. But, to date, the Wife has remained resident in Brunei although she said that she continued to visit her sons in Singapore once every 2 months and she would stay for at least a week. It was also noted that in the Wife’s affidavit, there was no evidence that at the time when she returned to Brunei in 1993, the parties had intended to reside permanently in Singapore and that their presence in Brunei was only temporary. On the contrary, the parties have resided in Brunei for about 26 years since they left Singapore in 1993.

27     I also noted that when the marriage broke down, the parties had entered into the Settlement Agreement which was governed by the laws of Brunei, as agreed between them, and the parties also agreed to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of Brunei. In addition, the Wife had engaged Bruneian lawyers and commenced divorce proceedings in the High Court of Brunei. Subsequently, in relation to the divorce proceedings commenced by the Husband in the Brunei Syariah Court, the Wife had also engaged Bruneian Syariah lawyers and participated in these proceedings, including proposing a fresh draft of a new settlement agreement on the ancillaries (different from the Settlement Agreement). The new settlement agreement proposed by the Wife also contained similar express provisions that the laws of Brunei would be the governing law and that parties agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of Brunei. Such actions and conduct by the parties would, on the face of it, be consistent with or evidence of their very close connection and familiarity with Brunei, the people and the legal systems there. It would be a stretch to suggest that on or around 2017 and 2018, the parties had treated Brunei only as a transient place to stay and work and had regarded Singapore as their permanent home when they had resided in Brunei for their entire lives since birth except for a short interlude of 5 years at most (between 1988 to 1993).

28     Based on the evidence before me, I found that according to the conflicts of laws in Singapore, neither of the parties had acquired a domicile of choice in Singapore between 1988 and 1993. In this regard, I noted that within a year after acquiring their Singapore citizenship in 1992, they had returned to Brunei their country of birth and continued with their lives and raised their family there. It would appear to me, based on the Wife’s evidence as set out in her affidavits and the Counterclaim, that the parties had acquired the Singapore citizenship not intending to reside in Singapore permanently. Even if the parties had acquired a domicile of choice in Singapore between 1988 and 1993, they had abandoned Singapore as their domicile and on the Relevant Dates, they were domiciled in Brunei.

29     Accordingly, on the Relevant Dates, the domicile of the parties was Brunei and the jurisdictional requirements stipulated in Section 121C had not been satisfied by either party. I therefore dismissed the Application and did not grant leave for the Wife to proceed with her application for a Financial Relief Order.
