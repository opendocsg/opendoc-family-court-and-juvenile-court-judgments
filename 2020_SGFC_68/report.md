Mental Disorders And Treatment – Management of patients’ property and affairs

22 October 2020

### District Judge Colin Tan:

## Introduction

1       This was an application for the revocation of a Lasting Power of Attorney (“LPA”).

2       The matter was heard in three tranches, with the first involving cross-examination of the Defendant on 2nd September 2019, the second involving cross-examination of expert witnesses on 9th September 2019, and the third, after an intervening discovery application and a delay due to the COVID-19 circuit breaker period, involving submissions by counsel on 15th June 2020.

## Facts

### The parties

3       The Defendant was the Donee of an LPA which had been executed by his mother (“the Donor”).

4       The Plaintiffs were the husband and daughters of the Donor and therefore the father and sisters of the Defendant.

### Background to the dispute

5       On 30th June 2015, the Donor executed an LPA naming her son, the Defendant, as Donee. The certificate issuer for the LPA was Dr Joshua Kua, a psychiatrist from Raffles Hospital.

6       This LPA was registered by the Office of the Public Guardian on 4th September 2015.

7       Subsequently, the Plaintiffs filed an application for cancellation of registration or revocation of this LPA.

8       It was also clear that there were different views among the family in regard to who was right and who was wrong as the Defendant was supported by the 1st Plaintiff’s own mother and sister as well as one of the Donor’s sisters, all of whom filed affidavits in support of him in this matter.

9       While the family members’ support for the Defendant certainly did not prove that the 1st Plaintiff was the party at fault, the fact that the 1st Plaintiff’s own mother and sister sided with the Defendant against him suggested that the family situation was a complex one.

10     I also noted that the 1st Plaintiff claimed to be a “loving husband”[^1] who “would have moved heaven and earth”[^2] just to be able to spend time with the Donor but he had actually commenced divorce proceedings against the Donor in October 2015[^3].

11     While what the 1st Plaintiff had stated in his Statement of Particulars might well have been true and the party at “fault” in the divorce proceedings might very well have been the Donor, the fact that the 1st Plaintiff had actually commenced divorce proceedings against the Donor was not consistent with his description of himself as a “loving husband” who “would have moved heaven and earth” to spend time with her, and I therefore found it difficult to believe his claims in this regard.

12     Interestingly, the 1st Plaintiff also cited the fact that the Donor had granted an LPA to the Defendant as one of the particulars of the Donor’s unreasonable behaviour[^4]. I also noted that there was no mention by the 1st Plaintiff that there was anything defective about the LPA.

13     As such, it appeared that in late 2015, the 1st Plaintiff’s view was that the Donor had acted unreasonably by appointing the Defendant as Donee under an LPA rather than viewing the LPA as invalid. After all, if the Donor had lacked mental capacity to execute the LPA, she could hardly be said to have been at fault in regard to executing the LPA.

14     In 2016, the divorce application was withdrawn, and, subsequently, in 2017, the Plaintiffs filed the current application to revoke the LPA. The legal disputes between the parties were also complicated by a claim by the Defendant, in his capacity as the Donor’s LPA donee, against the 1st Plaintiff for the Donor’s share of rental income for properties jointly owned by the 1st Plaintiff and the Donor. This particular dispute dated back to 2016, based on the correspondence, and culminated in the filing of a Writ in 2017.

## The parties’ cases

15     The Plaintiffs’ case, as set out in the Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s written submissions, was as follows:

> (a)     that the Defendant had improper motives in relation to the execution of the LPA;

> (b)     that the Defendant had exerted undue influence on the Donor;

> (c)     that the Donor had lacked the requisite mental capacity to create the LPA; and

> (d)     that the Defendant had not acted in the Donor’s best interests.

16     The Defendant denied the Plaintiffs’ allegations.

17     After considering the evidence and submissions, I dismissed the Plaintiffs’ application. When I gave my decision, I briefly explained that I had reached the view that there was insufficient evidence to prove the Plaintiffs’ claims and I also explained my views on the legal issues concerning undue influence and the certificate issuer, both of which had constituted a significant portion of the Plaintiffs’ submissions.

18     I now set out herein the detailed grounds of my decision, and, in particular, my assessment of the evidence and how I reached the view that there was insufficient evidence to prove the Plaintiffs’ claims.

## Issues to be determined

19     In deciding this case, the issues which had to be determined were as follows:

> (a)     the relevance of the Defendant’s motives;

> (b)     whether undue pressure was used to induce the donor to create the LPA;

> (c)     whether the Donor had the requisite mental capacity to create the LPA; and

> (d)     whether the Defendant had behaved in a way that was not in the Donor’s best interests.

20     After determining the above issues, I then had to consider the issue of cancellation of registration or revocation of the LPA.

21     Section 17(4) of the Mental Capacity Act (“MCA”) confers on the court the power to revoke an LPA.

22     Paragraph 17 of the First Schedule of the MCA states that the court “must” direct the Public Guardian to cancel the registration of an LPA if a requirement for creating the LPA was not met.

23     Sections 17(3)(a) and (4) of the MCA provide that where “fraud or undue pressure was used to induce” the donor the create the LPA or where the donee has not acted in the donor’s best interests, the court “may” revoke the LPA.

24     The difference between the provisions was important as one provision stated that the court “must” direct cancellation of registration while the other stated that the court “may” revoke the LPA. Lack of mental capacity to execute the LPA fell within the “must” cancel provision while undue pressure and not acting in the Donor’s best interests fell within the “may” revoke provision.

## Defendant’s motives

25     The Plaintiff’s alleged that the Defendant had improper motives in the execution of the LPA.

26     The criteria for revocation of an LPA are clearly spelt out in the MCA, and improper motives is not one such ground. Therefore, unless the improper motives resulted in fraud or undue pressure being used to induce the Donor to execute the LPA, the fact that the Defendant may have had improper motives was not in itself a sufficient ground to revoke the LPA.

27     However, I did take into account the Plaintiffs’ submissions relating to the Defendant’s motives when considering the other issues at hand.

## Undue pressure

28     Sections 17(3)(a) and (4) of the MCA provide that where “fraud or undue pressure was used to induce” the donor the create the LPA, the court “may” revoke the LPA.

29     The main safeguard against undue pressure being used to induce a donor to create an LPA is the requirement that the certificate issuer examines the donor and considers if there has been fraud or undue pressure. This is a requirement set out in paragraph 2(1)(e) of the First Schedule of the MCA and this is also set out in the standard LPA form issued by the Office of the Public Guardian.

30     Paragraph 7 of the Mental Capacity Regulations 2010 specifies that only psychiatrists, accredited medical practitioners and advocates and solicitors holding a practising certificate can be certificate issuers.

31     In the current case, Dr Joshua Kua, a psychiatrist at Raffles Hospital, was the certificate issuer for this LPA and he stated in the LPA form that, in his opinion, no fraud or undue pressure had been used to induce the Donor to create the LPA.

32     The Plaintiffs’ position was as follows:

> (a)     they implied that Dr Kua’s evidence might be untrue[^5];

> (b)     they asserted that the Defendant had concealed factual information from Dr Kua and that it was because of this lack of information that Dr Kua reached his view that there was no undue pressure on the Donor; and

> (c)     they asserted that the Donor was susceptible to undue influence, that the Defendant was in a position to influence the Donor, and that the Defendant fell within a relationship of trust and confidence.

33     Although the Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s written submissions referred to “undue influence”, I have used the term “undue pressure” here as that is the term used in the MCA.

34     The issue of undue pressure must be considered in the light of the statutory framework governing LPAs.

35     It is clear from the fact that a certificate issuer is required for an LPA, from the fact that only a narrow range of persons can be certificate issuers, and from the fact that the certificate issuer must certify that in his or her opinion there has been no undue pressure, that the risk of undue pressure on a LPA donor was considered by Parliament when the MCA was passed, and the framework created by Parliament suggests that Parliament felt that this was a reasonable and adequate method of preventing LPAs from being executed by persons under undue pressure.

36     Based on the above, it is clear that the certificate issuer requirement serves as a significant safeguard against undue pressure in the creation of an LPA.

37     The MCA recognises that capacity must be decided in relation to the decision in question and at the time in question as a person may lack capacity to decide on some matters but have capacity to decide on other matters, and, similarly, a person’s lack of capacity may be temporary, in which case the person may, at one point in time, lack capacity, and, at another point in time, have capacity.

38     In view of the above, the fact that a certificate issuer would have examined the LPA donor at the time of execution of the LPA means that the certificate issuer’s opinion must be given due weight in comparison to the opinion or observations of other experts who might have examined the LPA donor some time before or after the execution of the LPA.

39     Therefore, while the opinion of a certificate issuer is by no means conclusive and is open to challenge, a certain amount of weight must, in general, be given to the certificate issuer’s opinion unless it is shown to be plainly wrong.

40     In a similar manner, the fact that the certificate issuer examines the donor and looks for undue pressure at the time of execution of the LPA would generally mean that he or she is best placed to determine if there actually was undue pressure at the time of execution of the LPA as compared to someone who determined what the situation was some time before the execution of the document or someone who, a long time after the execution of the document, tries to speculate on what went through the donor’s mind at the time of the execution of the document.

41     Also, looking at this from the viewpoint of the statutory framework establishing the requirement for certificate issuers, it is likely that Parliament intended that the view of certificate issuers be given due weight in order to preserve the functioning of the entire LPA process.

42     Lastly, a certificate issuer is a neutral third party given that paragraph 7 of the Mental Capacity Regulations 2010 bar certain persons, e.g. family members, from being certificate issuers. In contrast, the parties in a litigated matter would very rarely qualify as neutral third parties.

43     After considering the evidence and submissions, I reached the view that the Plaintiffs had not proven that there had been undue pressure. The reasons why I reached this view are set out below.

### Truthfulness of Dr Kua’s evidence

44     I noted that the Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s submissions did not make an outright assertion that Dr Kua’s evidence was untrue but merely implied this through the use of statements like “if indeed it was true” and describing what was said as an “afterthought”.

45     After considering the evidence and also the cross-examination of Dr Kua by the Plaintiffs’ Counsel, I found no evidence to suggest that Dr Kua’s evidence was untrue, and I therefore accepted that he was a truthful witness.

### Concealment of information from Dr Kua

46     In regard to the concealment of information from Dr Kua, I accepted that the Defendant had not told Dr Kua certain things about the Donor. However, based on Dr Kua’s testimony during cross-examination, I found that while Dr Kua accepted that, if he had had such information, he might have asked the Donor more questions about these particular issues, the Plaintiffs had not actually demonstrated that Dr Kua would have reached a different opinion on the issue of undue influence if such information had been given to him.

47     It is important to bear in mind that a medical examination is rarely perfect and the question is not so much if more could have been done or if something had been omitted but whether these additional points are of importance in the sense that the doctor might have reached a different opinion if not for these omissions.

48     To expect every examination of an LPA donor by a certificate issuer to reach the standard of perfection, as opposed to a reasonable standard which would enable the certificate issuer to make an accurate assessment of the LPA donor in regard to capacity and absence of undue pressure, would be unrealistic and would place an impossible burden on certificate issuers, and would probably call into question the vast majority of LPAs executed on the ground that the certificate issuers had not conducted “perfect” examinations of the LPA donors.

49     While, in an ideal world, the certificate issuer would find out every single relevant fact about the LPA donor, this is not practical, and the issue at hand is whether or not the certificate issuer in this case reached a wrong conclusion in regard to undue pressure.

50     From the evidence before the court in regard to how Dr Kua conducted his examination of the Donor, and bearing in mind that, from a practical perspective, a medical examination for an LPA cannot possibly cover every possible test and every possible piece of information, and taking into account the fact that the Plaintiffs had not proven that Dr Kua would have reached a different opinion if he had been given more information about the Donor, I was of the view that there was no reason to find that Dr Kua’s examination of the Donor was so lacking that his opinion could not be relied on.

51     After considering the evidence, I reached the view that the Plaintiffs had not proven that Dr Kua’s opinion that there had been no undue pressure on the Donor was wrong.

52     As such, since the Plaintiffs had failed to prove that Dr Kua’s opinion, based on his examination of the Donor, was wrong, I found no reason to reject his certification that there had been no undue pressure and I therefore concluded that the Plaintiffs had failed to prove that there had been undue pressure on the Donor.

### Susceptibility to undue pressure

53     On the issue of susceptibility to undue influence or undue pressure, while it was likely that the Donor, due to age and medical condition, could potentially be susceptible to undue influence, there is a difference between being susceptible and actually be unduly influenced.

54     In the context of an LPA, the potential for undue pressure must be considered in the light of the fact that a doctor or lawyer has considered the issue at the time of execution of the LPA and concluded that there was no undue pressure.

55     In the light of the statutory framework governing LPAs, and, given that there was no clear evidence of undue pressure and also the opinion of the psychiatrist who examined the Donor at the time of execution of the LPA, I reached the view that while it could reasonably be said that the Donor was potentially susceptible to undue influence, there was insufficient evidence to prove that there had actually been undue pressure to induce the Donor to create the LPA.

56     I had also highlighted to counsel that, using Wills as an example, that there was a difference between persuasion and undue influence and, in like manner, a difference between some degree of dishonesty and outright fraud. Using a Will as an example, if a person simply asks another to include him as a beneficiary, that may amount to persuasion but, without more, it cannot be said to be undue influence. Similarly, if a testator is angry with a potential beneficiary and wants to cut him off, another beneficiary who would stand to profit from this may omit to inform the testator of facts that might exonerate the first beneficiary but, without more, this omission on its own would not be fraud.

## Mental capacity to create the LPA

57     It was the Plaintiffs’ case that the Donor lacked the requisite mental capacity to create the LPA.

58     The Plaintiffs relied on the following to prove their case:

> (a)     the evidence of Dr Nagaendran Kandiah;

> (b)     the Donor’s Home Protection Scheme claim;

> (c)     the Defendant’s reluctance to produce documents;

> (d)     the manner of execution of the LPA; and

> (e)     evidence of past behaviour.

59     It was clear from the evidence that the Donor suffered from dementia and had some degree of cognitive impairment.

60     However, the question to be determined was not a general one in terms of medical diagnosis or a general determination of the Donor’s cognitive ability but was instead the specific question of whether the Donor had the requisite mental capacity to execute an LPA.

61     It was established in _Re BKR_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGCA 26</span> that the test for capacity involves both a functional component in the sense that the person is unable to make a decision for himself, and a clinical component in the sense of a medical condition.

62     It was clear from the evidence that a person may have a particular medical condition, e.g. dementia, but this does not necessarily mean that the person lacks mental capacity as persons with such medical conditions may still have mental capacity to make particular decisions.

63     As set out above, the MCA recognises that mental capacity is decision-specific in the sense that a person may lack capacity to make some decisions but may have capacity to make decisions on other matters, and also time-specific in the sense that a person may have good days and bad days such that he or she is more lucid or some days (or at some times) than on others. As such, assessment of mental capacity should ideally be done in relation to the decision at hand and at the time of making the decision in question.

64     In the current case, it was clear that the Donor had dementia and therefore the clinical component criterion was satisfied, and the question to be determined was therefore whether dementia had caused the Donor to lack the requisite mental capacity to make the decision in question, i.e. on whether or not to execute the LPA.

65     After considering the evidence and submissions, I reached the view that the Plaintiffs had not proven that the Donor lacked the requisite mental capacity to execute the LPA. The reasons why I reached this view are set out below.

### Dr Nagaendran’s evidence

66     Understandably, the Plaintiffs relied significantly on the evidence of their expert witness, Dr Nagaendran.

67     At the outset, I should state that, having heard both Dr Nagaendran and Dr Kua give evidence in court and undergo cross-examination, I formed the view that they were both knowledgeable and competent experts who were giving honest opinions based on their respective examination findings and experience.

68     In assessing Dr Nagaendran’s evidence, I noted that Dr Nagaendran had stated in response to a question by the Plaintiffs’ Counsel that it was his opinion that the Donor would not have had the ability to execute an LPA[^6].

69     However, Dr Nagaendran had also acknowledged that when he last saw the Donor in April 2015, he had not inquired into her ability to execute a legal document[^7]. I should state that this is not a criticism of Dr Nagaendran’s examination of the Donor as he had not inquired into this simply because he had no reason to do so at that point in time.

70     In relation to the above, I also noted that Dr Nagaendran had agreed during cross-examination that when he saw the Donor he was not looking to assess capacity[^8].

71     This difference in the examination of the Donor by Dr Kua and Dr Nagaendran was also seen when Dr Kua explained the detailed and rigorous approach he used for assessing capacity and Dr Nagaendran had stated that he agreed with this approach but that he had not applied this approach when he examined the Donor because his examination of the Donor was “not for the purpose of mental capacity”[^9]. As set out above, this is not a criticism of Dr Nagaendran as it was clear from the evidence that he did not apply this approach simply because determining mental capacity was not the purpose of his examination of the Donor.

72     Lastly, the Plaintiffs’ Counsel, in written submissions, cited the Donor’s Mini-Mental State Examination (“MMSE”) scores. However, Dr Nagaendran had stated during cross-examination that the MMSE test is not designed to assess incapacity[^10]. Therefore, while the trend in the MMSE scores can give an indication of a patient’s progress, the MMSE scores in themselves do not prove that a particular person would lack the mental capacity to execute an LPA.

73     As such, given that Dr Nagendran last saw the Donor about 2 months prior to the execution of the LPA and was not specifically assessing the Donor’s mental capacity to execute the LPA, as compared to Dr Kua who saw the Donor at the time of execution of the LPA and specifically assessed the Donor in relation to mental capacity to execute the LPA, I felt that greater weight should be given to Dr Kua’s opinion in relation to mental capacity to execute the LPA, and I was therefore unable to accept Dr Nagaendran’s opinion that the Donor lacked mental capacity to execute the LPA.

### The Donor’s Home Protection Scheme claim

74     It was the Plaintiffs’ case that the Defendant had relied on Dr Nagaendran’s 2016 medical report to make a claim for the Donor under the Home Protection Scheme and that this medical report stated that the Donor had been incapacitated since 2014 and, as such, the Donor lacked mental capacity to create the LPA.

75     Both Dr Kua and Dr Nagaendran agreed that mental capacity is decision-specific[^11], and it was clear from the evidence of the Dr Nagaendran, the Plaintiffs’ own expert, that his assessment that the Donor in relation to the Home Protection Scheme claim was in relation to employment, and not execution of an LPA, as stated by him explicitly when he gave oral evidence in court[^12].

76     In regard to the assessment form he completed, Dr Nagaendran’s position was as follows: (a) he was only assessing the Donor’s ability to carry on with paid employment, (b) he was not assessing the Donor’s ability to make decisions for herself, (c) he was not asserting that the Donor lacked capacity under the MCA[^13].

77     In relation to the above, Dr Kua highlighted that there was a difference between inability to work and inability to execute an LPA and that he had seen patients who, due to their conditions, were unable to work but yet did not have such severe cognitive impairments that would render them unable to execute LPAs[^14].

78     After considering the above, I was of the view that the fact that a Home Protection Scheme claim had been made for the Donor did not prove that the Donor lacked the mental capacity to execute the LPA.

### The Defendant’s reluctance to produce documents

79     I agreed with the Plaintiffs’ Counsel that the Defendant had been reluctant to produce documents.

80     However, while this might say a great deal about the Defendant as a person and might well have given rise to suspicion that he was hiding something, it did not, in itself, prove that the Donor lacked the requisite mental capacity to execute the LPA.

### Manner of execution of the LPA

81     The Plaintiffs relied on the following to argue that there was something amiss in regard to the manner of execution of the LPA:

> (a)     that someone other than the Donor had filled in the LPA form for the Donor; and

> (b)     that the Donor had executed the LPA with a thumbprint instead of a signature.

82     In an ideal world, it might well be made a requirement that an LPA donor completes the LPA form himself or herself. However, this is not practical as some persons due to education, frailty or simply convenience, might opt for a third party to complete the form for them. In the context of an LPA, an LPA donor must clearly trust the donee given that he or she is about to entrust his or her affairs to this donee, and, therefore, it stands to reason that it would not be something out of the ordinary if the LPA donor gets the proposed donee to fill up the LPA form for him or her.

83     While the fact that the Donor in this case did not fill up the form herself might well be a cause for suspicion, a mere suspicion cannot, in itself, be a cause for revocation of the LPA.

84     In relation to the Donor applying her thumbprint to the LPA instead of signing it, I noted that Dr Kua had stated that as patients with dementia deteriorate, some lose the ability to sign[^15].

85     In considering this issue, I was of the view that the entire matter must once again be considered in the light of the statutory framework for LPAs. It is clear that Parliament entrusted the safeguarding of donees, in relation to the execution of LPAs, to certificate issuers, and, therefore, this serves as an important safeguard which the court must take into account when considering LPAs that have been executed in a manner which does not reach the absolute ideal standard.

86     I noted that the matters complained of were not in themselves wrong in any way as an LPA would be valid even if the LPA form had been filled up by someone else and even if the LPA donor had applied a thumbprint instead of signing the document.

87     I also noted that the Plaintiffs were not saying that the LPA was invalid because of the above matters but was rather inviting the court to infer from these matters that P lacked the requisite mental capacity to execute the LPA.

88     Having considered the evidence given by Dr Kua in relation to the manner of execution of the LPA, while it would have been ideal if the issues highlighted by the Plaintiffs had been avoided, I came to the view that these matters were not sufficient to prove that the Donor lacked the requisite mental capacity to execute the LPA.

### Evidence of past behaviour

89     The Plaintiffs relied on various incidents in regard to the Donor’s past behaviour to support their claim that she lacked the mental capacity to execute the LPA. However, these incidents were not directly connected with the execution of the LPA.

90     I was of the view that while these incidents did lend support to the position that the Donor did have dementia and some degree of impairment, these incidents in themselves could not prove that the Donor lacked capacity to execute the LPA and that, furthermore, the weight to be given to Dr Kua’s evidence on capacity far outweighed that to be given to these incidents in view of the fact that Dr Kua was a psyhiatrist who examined the Donor at the time of execution of the LPA while these incidents were reported by non-psychiatrists and were not directly related to the execution of the LPA.

## Best interests

91     The Plaintiffs also argued that the Defendant had not acted in the Donor’s best interests.

92     The factors cited by the Plaintiffs, as set out in the Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s written submissions, in support of this were as follows:

> (a)     that the Defendant, in his capacity as donee under the LPA, had commenced a civil suit against the 1st Plaintiff in 2017;

> (b)     that the Defendant had refused to allow the Plaintiffs to visit the Donor while allowing other relatives to visit her;

> (c)     that the Defendant had “unilaterally dragged P out of her family home” on 19th September 2015 (the reference to “P” was a reference to the Donor);

> (d)     making allegations against the Plaintiffs in the current proceedings; and

> (e)     various other allegations relating to incidents between the parties.

### The suit against the 1st Plaintiff

93     The suit which the Defendant, in his capacity as donee under the LPA, had commenced against the 1st Plaintiff was in relation to rental monies allegedly owed by the 1st Plaintiff to the Donor in relation to jointly-owned properties.

94     There was no evidence from the Plaintiffs to show that this was a baseless claim.

95     If monies were indeed owed by the 1st Plaintiff to the Donor, not only was such an action not against the Donor’s bests interests but potentially such an action would actually be in the Donor’s best interests as it aimed to recover monies due to her.

96     However, as the civil suit is a separate matter, I have refrained from commenting on its merits, and I took the view that, on the evidence put forward by the parties in this matter, the Plaintiffs had not proven that the suit against the 1st Plaintiff was an instance of the Defendant acting in a way that was not in the Donor’s best interests.

### Refusal to allow the Plaintiffs to visit the Donor

97     The Plaintiffs argued that the Defendant had not allowed them to visit the Donor, while allowing other relatives to visit her, and that he had therefore acted against the Donor’s best interests.

98     The Defendant, on the other hand, justified his actions by alleging that contact with the Plaintiffs had worsened the Donor’s medical condition as the Donor suffered from BPSD, i.e. Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Demntia.

99     Both parties had their own versions and there was no clear evidence to prove that one side was definitely right and the other was definitely wrong.

100    The fact that the Plaintiffs had stated that the Defendant was allowing other relatives to visit the Donor meant that he was not cutting the Donor off from contact with everyone, and the reason from preventing the Plaintiffs from seeing the Donor was therefore either because he genuinely believed that such contact was harmful or because he was just being spiteful towards the,m due to the bad past history between them.

101    I was of the view that the Plaintiffs had not proven that the Defendant was being spiteful while, at the same time, it appeared that a total refusal to let the Plaintiffs see the Donor might well have been a bit excessive.

102    Assuming, for the sake of argument, that the Defendant had indeed acted against the Donor’s best interests in this matter, the question then was what to do. I noted that section 17(4) of the MCA provides that the court “may” revoke the LPA in such a case. It was important to note that the word was “may” as opposed to “must” (which was the situation when a requirement for creating an LPA was not met).

103    Therefore, the use of the word “may” indicated that Parliament intended the courts to have the discretion on whether or not to revoke the LPA in question in such a situation.

104    I also noted that section 18 of the MCA empowers the court to give directions with respect to decisions to be made.

105    Therefore, it was possible for the Plaintiffs to have applied to the court to give directions allowing them to visit the Donor.

106    However, they chose not to do so.

107    Instead, they chose the draconian route of applying for the LPA to be revoked.

108    Just as the Defendant’s actions in preventing the Plaintiffs from seeing the Donor might have been described as excessive, the Plaintiffs’ attempt to revoke the LPA as opposed to seeking directions to allow them to see the Donor could also be described as excessive.

109    An LPA represents the wishes of a donor in regard to who is to look after his or her affairs and it is important for the court to consider the donor’s wishes. Once a donor loses mental capacity, he or she cannot execute a fresh LPA and revocation of the existing LPA would be an irreversible act that puts an end to the document setting out the donor’s wishes.

110    As such, revocation of an LPA is not something which should be done lightly and should only be done if there is a strong reason to do so.

111    Therefore, not every action that is against a donor’s best interests merits revocation of an LPA and some might well be more suitably remedied by the court giving directions on what should or should not be done.

112    An example that illustrates the above might be a situation where the LPA donee brings the donor, who is complaining of a mild cough, to clinic X instead of clinic Y simply because the LPA donee finds the receptionist at clinic X pretty and he wants to see her, but, as a result, the donor ends up waiting for two hours because clinic X is crowded as compared to clinic Y which is empty. It is clearly not in the donor’s best interests to be subjected to a two-hour wait for nothing but this surely cannot be a breach that is serious enough to merit revocation of an LPA. This is certainly not an ideal example in view of the current COVID-19 situation, but it illustrates the principle that not every action that is against a donor’s best interests merits revocation of an LPA and that we must take into account proportionality and consider the extent and seriously of the default.

113    In the current case, I was of the view that, while the Defendant’s actions in preventing the Plaintiffs from seeing the Donor were serious enough to raise concerns and questions about the Defendant’s conduct as donee, it was not clear that these actions in were definitely against the Donor’s best interests but, even if these actions were against the Donor’s best interests, when balanced against giving weight to the Donor’s wishes in the LPA, they were not of such magnitude that the LPA should be revoked as there was the less extreme option of getting the court’s directions under section 18 which could easily remedy the problem complained of. Unfortunately, as mentioned above, the Plaintiffs chose not to take this route.

### “Unilaterally dragged” the Donor out of her home

114    The Plaintiffs alleged that the Defendant had unilaterally dragged the Donor out of her home.

115    However, the Defendant’s version of events was that he had arranged to move the Donor out of the 1st Plaintiff’s home because of the poor treatment she had received at the hands of the Plaintiffs and that the Donor had wanted to move.

116    I noted that when the 1st Plaintiff commenced his divorce proceedings in October 2015 against the Donor, one of the particulars of unreasonable behaviour cited by him was the fact that the Donor had moved out of the matrimonial home on 19th September 2015.

117    The date corresponds to the date cited by the Plaintiffs’ Counsel in the written submissions where it was argued that the Defendant had “unilaterally dragged” the Donor from her home.

118    Since the divorce proceedings had been commenced about 3 weeks after this incident, the 1st Plaintiff’s recollection of events then would presumably have been fairly clear and his position then was that the Donor had left the matrimonial home and not that she had been “dragged” from the home by the Defendant. Clearly, if the Donor had been “dragged” from the home by a third party, this could hardly constitute unreasonable behaviour on her part.

119    As such, I was of the view that the Defendant’s version of events was more credible and that it was more likely than not that the Donor had left the home voluntarily.

### Making allegations in the current proceedings

120    The Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s submissions cite the fact that the Defendant has made allegations against the Plaintiffs in the current proceedings as evidence that the Defendant has not acted in the Donor’s best interests.

121    I did not agree with the Plaintiff’s Counsel as, given that opposing parties in proceedings do make allegations against each other, I was of the view that this was hardly a basis for claiming that the Defendant was acting against the Donor’s best interests.

### Other allegations

122    The other allegations cited by the Plaintiffs’ Counsel were generally related to contact with the Donor but also included the allegation that the Defendant had asked the Plaintiffs to direct further queries to his solicitors.

123    The issue of contact with the Donor has been discussed above.

124    In regard to one party asking another party to direct further queries to his solicitors, this might well be construed as unfriendly or even antagonistic, but, given the history of a very bad relationship between the Defendant and 1st Plaintiff, this is understandable and can hardly be said to be an instance of the Defendant acting against the Donor’s best interests.

## Wills and LPAs

125    I noted that the Plaintiffs’ Counsel had attempted to draw analogies between Wills and LPAs and I therefore felt that it was important to highlight an important difference between the two.

126    An LPA donee is more akin to an executor under a Will rather than a beneficiary given that an LPA is not meant to benefit the donee but rather than the donor. An LPA donee, like an executor, is there to do work. Therefore, considerations relating to beneficiaries under a Will might have to be viewed from a different perspective in relation to an LPA donee.

## Conclusion

127    As set out above, I came to the conclusion that the Plaintiffs had failed to prove their case and I therefore dismissed their application.

128    On the issue of costs, the Defendant’s Counsel argued that costs should be awarded to the Defendant while the Plaintiff’s Counsel argued that each party should bear their own costs.

129    Although the general rule is that costs follow the event, I was of the view that the Defendant’s behaviour in this matter was less than ideal and, while the intensity of the dispute was certainly exacerbated by the poor relationship between the parties, the Defendant’s actions had certainly also contributed to this. As such, on balance, looking at the facts and also how the Defendant’s actions over the entire period contributed to this, I agreed with the Plaintiffs’ Counsel that the fairest order was that the parties should each bear their own costs.
