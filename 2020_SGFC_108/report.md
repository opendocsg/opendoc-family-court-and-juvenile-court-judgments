Matrimonial law – Women’s Charter – Ancillary issues – Variation of order – Maintenance of children

21 December 2020

### District Judge Sheik Mustafa:

## Introduction

1       This is a case of an application by an ex-wife against her ex-husband to vary certain portions of an order consequent to their divorce regarding maintenance of children of the marriage. Throughout this judgment I shall refer to the ex-wife as “the Mother”, to the ex-husband as “the Father”, and to the them collectively as “the Parents”.

2       I heard the parties and made orders broadly in favour of the Mother’s application. The Father appeals, and these are the grounds of my decision.

## Background

3       The Parents have 3 children. I shall refer to them as the First Child, the Second Child and the Third Child respectively. The Parents’ marriage to each other was dissolved and a final judgment was entered on \[xx\] August 2015. There were a few orders made dealing with ancillary issues. The only order in issue before me is one from March 2015, which states that the Father is to pay $14,000 a month to the Mother for the maintenance of the 3 children on the first day of every month. On appeal, the High Court revised the figure to $16,000 a month. I will refer to this order, as revised on appeal, as the “existing order”.

4       The First Child turned 21 years old in May this year and is therefore no longer a minor. The Mother, who is represented by Counsel, now applies to vary the existing order, to deal with maintenance for the remaining 2 children who are still minors. She asks for the existing order to be varied as follows-

> a.     For the Father to pay $13,942 per month for the 2 younger children for the period of June to August 2020,

> b.     For the Father to pay $14,445 per month for the 2 younger children from 1 September 2020 onwards,

> c.     For the Parents to contribute to younger children’s certain extraordinary expenses in the proportion of 30 : 70 (i.e. 70% by the Father),

> d.     For the Father to pay the payments into the Mother’s bank account,

> e.     That the Father is not to deduct or offset anything from the maintenance payments without the Mother’s prior written consent. If the Farther pays directly to any vendors then he is to show proof to the Mother within 7 days, and that the Mother will reimburse him within 7 days of receipt of following month’s maintenance payment.

5       The Father contests the application. He represents himself.

## The Children

6       The First Child became 21 years old in May this year. At the time of the first existing order, he was 16 years old, and attending a boarding school in the USA. At the time when High Court made the existing order, he was back in Singapore. Since August 2019 to July 2020 he was living in the USA and attending university in Boston. He has transferred to a university in San Francisco for Fall 2020.

7       The Second Child is 18 years old. At the time of the making of the existing order, he was 13 years old, and a student at an international school in Singapore. He graduated from there in May 2020. He is enrolled in a university in the USA for the 2020/2021 academic year.

8       The Third Child is 13 years old. At the time of the making of the existing order, she was 8 years old. She is now in Grade 8 in an international school in Singapore.

## The Father’s preliminary objection

9       Before the present application was filed by the Mother, the Father had filed an application to reduce the maintenance he has to pay under the existing order, as well as to request a refund of some payments as excess payments. On \[X\] April 2020, the Father’s application was dismissed but he was ordered to pay a reduced amount of maintenance under the existing order.

10     After that decision was handed down, the Mother filed the present application. Subsequently, both Parents filed appeals against the decision made in the Father’s application.

11     The Father now argues that, since the decision of the earlier application is under appeal, I am estopped from hearing the present application.

12     I reject this argument. The issues and facts relied upon in the two cases are distinct and independent. The Father’s earlier application dealt with his maintenance obligations for all 3 children, including the First Child. The facts for the present application occur after the First Child had attained majority, and its issue is confined to the Father’s obligations to maintain only the Second Child and the Third Child.

13     With the Father’s objection rejected, I proceed to hear the parties on the Mother’s application.

## Applicable law

14     The Women’s Charter provides that parents have a legal duty to maintain their children. This is stated expressly as follows-

> _a_.     _Duty of parents to maintain children_

> **_68\._** _\-- Except where an agreement or order of court otherwise provides, it shall be the duty of a parent to maintain or contribute to the maintenance of his or her children, whether they are in his or her custody or the custody of any other person, and whether they are legitimate or illegitimate, either by providing them with such accommodation, clothing, food and education as may be reasonable having regard to his or her means and station in life or by paying the cost thereof._

15.    Orders of maintenance of children, once given, may be varied. This is provided for in sections 72 and 118 of the Women’s Charter-

> _a_.     _Rescission and variation of order_

> **_72.—_** _(1) On the application of any person receiving or ordered to pay a monthly allowance under this Part and on proof of a change in the circumstances of that person, or that person’s wife, incapacitated husband or child, or for other good cause being shown to the satisfaction of the court, the court by which the order was made may rescind the order or may vary it as it thinks fit._

> _(2) Without prejudice to the extent of the discretion conferred upon the court by subsection (1), the court may, in considering any application made under this section, take into consideration any change in the general cost of living which may have occurred between the date of the making of the order sought to be varied and the date of the hearing of the application._

> **_118\._** _\-- The court may at any time vary or rescind any subsisting order for maintenance, whether secured or unsecured, on the application of the person in whose favour or of the person against whom the order was made, or, in respect of secured maintenance, of the legal personal representatives of the latter, where it is satisfied that the order was based on any misrepresentation or mistake of fact or where there has been any material change in the circumstances._

16     Section 69 of the Women’s Charter lists the factors that the Court shall consider when ordering maintenance –

> _Court may order maintenance of wife, incapacitated husband and children_

> 69.- (4)     _The court, when ordering maintenance for a wife, an incapacitated husband or a child under this section, shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the following matters:_

>> (_a_)     _the financial needs of the wife, incapacitated husband or child;_

>> (_b_)     _the income, earning capacity (if any), property and other financial resources of the wife, incapacitated husband or child;_

>> (_c_)     _any physical or mental disability of the wife, incapacitated husband or child;_

>> (_d_)     _the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage;_

>> (_e_)     _the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family;_

>> (_f_)     _the standard of living enjoyed —_

>>> (_i_)     _by the wife before her husband neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for her;_

>>> (_ii_)    _by the incapacitated husband before his wife neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for him; or_

>>> (_iii_)    _by the child before a parent neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the child;_

>> (_g_)     _in the case of a child, the manner in which he was being, and in which the parties to the marriage expected him to be, educated or trained; and_

>> (_h_)     _the conduct of each of the parties to the marriage, if the conduct is such that it would in the opinion of the court be inequitable to disregard it._

> (_5_)     _…_

> (_6_)     _An order under subsection (2) ceases to be in force on the day on which the child attains the age of 21 years unless the order is expressed to continue in force for a period ending after that day._

## Issues to be decided

> a.     Has there been a change of circumstances or other good cause shown to the court’s satisfaction, such that I ought to vary the existing order?

> b.     What are the reasonable expenses of the Second Child and the Third Child?

> c.     How is their maintenance to be shared between the Parents?

## The Mother’s case

17     The Mother is 50 years old. At the time when the existing order was made she earned an average monthly income of $19,000. She is now a freelance consultant/communication coach. At the time of filing the present application, she has 2 sources of earnings, both resulting from consulting agreements, with 2 organisations. As a freelance consultant, the Mother does not have a fixed salary nor bonuses or other benefits, apart from $4,000 a month as a consultant fee from one of the organisations. Other than that, she would receive variable amounts of earnings depending on the number and types of services she conducts.

## The Father’s case

18     The Father is 56 years old. At the time when the existing order was made he was a managing director, earning $47,000 a month. In March 2020, he signed a 12-month contract, with an option to renew, with another firm. Under this contract, he receives a monthly salary of $30,000, and a monthly car allowance of $1,500. He is entitled to a performance bonus of $180,000 at the end of each completed year. The Father contends that he has numerous liabilities which leave him with little means left.

## Changes in circumstances

19     I find that changes in circumstances have taken place since when the existing order was made. The changes are enough to satisfy me that a variation of the existing order is required.

20     The First Child became 21 years old in May this year. The existing order is not expressed to continue in force for him for any period thereafter. This means that the existing order for $14,000 monthly maintenance that was meant to cover 3 children is no longer relevant. What remains now is for the Father to pay to the Mother maintenance for the Second Child and the Third Child only. This change alone is enough to justify a re-examination of the Father’s maintenance liability.

21     The means of the Parents have also changed. I find that this fact is also a change of circumstance that may justify a variation of the Father’s maintenance liability.

22     I find that the means of the Mother has reduced from $19,000 at the time of the existing order to $13,900 at present.

23     I find that the means of the Father has reduced from $47,000 at the time of the existing order, to $30,700 a month at present.

24     As a result, the combined means of the Parents have reduced from $66,000 a month to $44,600 a month at present. The proportion of the Father’s contribution of the Parents’ present combined means is therefore 69%.

## Expenses of the children

25     I find that the expenses of the Second Child have increased since the time of the existing order to the present. I find that the reasonable monthly expenses of the Second Child are now $10,000 a month. This is mostly based on the $10,301.66 figure of the Mother’s list of the Second Child’s expenses, which I accept as correct, with the exception of slightly excessive expense of $398 per month for entertainment, which in my view, ought to be $100.

26     I find that the expenses of the Third Child is now $8,700. The Mother had submitted the total expense to be $10,042.54. I find that the Third Child’s expenses are $5,962.54 with another $2,748.50 imputed as her portion of the Mother’s household expense. This adds up to $8,711.04, which I round down to $8,700.

27     The total expense of the two children is $18,700. This is equal to 42% of the combined means of the parents. It is reasonable in the circumstances.

## Allocation of maintenance between the parents

28     The approach to take on this issue is thus: recognising that each parent stands in the same parent-child relationship with the child or children and each parent has the duty to maintain the child or children. Against that backdrop, the starting point should be that the parents bear the financial burden equally. However, this should not be an inflexible rule; if one parent is unable to contribute equally with the other parent, then that parent should contribute what he or she can, and the other parent should make up the shortfall, so that the child will receive the full measure of maintenance[^1].

29     If the combined expense of the children is to be divided equally at $9,350, it would be 69.26% of the Mother’s present income of $13,900. I find that the Mother is not able to contribute an equal share to the combined maintenance of the two Children.

30     I find instead that the Father ought to bear a share of the expense proportionate to his share of contribution to the parents’ combined income, that is 69%.

31     The effect is that the Father would be spending 43% of his income, whilst the Mother 41.7% of her income. I find that in the circumstances, this is a just and equitable result.

## Conclusion

32     In view of the above, I find that the Father ought to bear $6,900 and $6,000 of the maintenance of the Second and Third Children respectively. The total is $12,900 per month.

33     The Father’s liability to maintain the Second and the Third Child began from June 2020, immediately after the First Child ceased to be a beneficiary of the order.

34     In addition to the existing and usual expenses of the Second Child and the Third Child, which are already covered in the maintenance payment stated above, there is the possibility of other, future, expenses which I shall refer to as “additional expenses”, I find that it is not just nor fair for the Mother to unilaterally decide on what these are to be, and then demand 69% of them from the Father. Any extraordinary expenses must first be agreed to by both Parents before any liability to pay is to arise.

35     I find that it is best for the Mother to receive the fixed sum of maintenance every month. I accept her request and I order that the Father is not to deduct or offset any payments he makes from the monthly maintenance sum.

## Costs

36     As the Mother is substantially successful in her application albeit in an award less than what she prays for, I find that the Father is liable to her for costs in this application, fixed at $2,000 inclusive of disbursements.
