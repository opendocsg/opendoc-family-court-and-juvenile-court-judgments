Ancillary Matters And Mental Health Examination

8 December 2020

### District Judge Toh Wee San:

1       There were two appeals, one from the Plaintiff Husband (the Husband) and one from the Defendant Wife (the Wife) against different parts of my orders concerning their divorce ancillary matters and related summons. I provide my written decision and reasons below.

## Background Facts

2       The parties were married in India on 1 December 2016. There is one child, a son to the marriage, born on 24 September 2017. The child will be three years old this year. The Husband is 44 years old and the Wife is 36 years old. In 2018, the Husband filed an application under s 5 of the Guardianship of Infants Act (Cap. 122), namely FC/OSG 54/2018, for, amongst others, sole custody, care and control of the child. Parties entered into a consent order on 8 August 2018 for joint custody of the child, care and control to the Wife and access to the Husband. On 3 February 2020, the Wife left the Husband with the child after alleged family violence till now. The marriage has been rocky since the start where the Wife had left the Husband twice (for one month and six months respectively) previously before the present third separation.

3       The Husband commenced divorce proceedings on 4 December 2019 and Interim Judgment was granted on 21 May 2020 on the basis of both parties’ unreasonable behaviour. The ancillary matters were contested and the issues to be determined included the following: -

> (a)     Custody, care and control and access to the child;

> (b)     Division of matrimonial assets;

> (c)     Maintenance for the child; and

> (d)     Maintenance for the wife.

4       In April 2020, the Husband filed Summons No. 1135/2020 under OSG 54/2018 to ask for reversal of care and control over the child and related matters. In June 2020, the Husband filed Summons No. 1524/2020 under D5852/2019 to ask for a second mental health examination of the Wife. These applications were dealt with together with or part of the ancillary matters. After reviewing evidence before me, I made the ancillary matters orders (which also addressed the prayers made under Summons No. 1135/2020) and dismissed Summons No. 1524/2020. A copy of my AM order is attached. I provide my decisions and brief reasons below.

## Husband’s summons application SS 1524/2020 (dismissed)

### Husband’s case for wife to undergo second mental health assessment

5       The Husband took the position that the Wife was behaving abnormally and had been subjecting him to constant abuse over the years[^1]. Despite the Wife having been discharged from the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) in 2018 and diagnosed with no mental disorder, the Husband argued that the said diagnosis was invalid.

### Wife’s case for her to undergo second mental health assessment

6       The Wife objected to the Husband’s application and argued that the Husband’s application for her to undergo mental health assessment was a tactic to get care and control of the child[^2]. The Wife stated that the Husband had previously admitted her to IMH in 2018 for no reason where she was warded for a period of 9 days. During this time, she was assessed by an IMH consultant who made a diagnosis of “No Mental Illness”. This Medical Report from the IMH dated 10 May 2018 was tendered by the Wife in the OSG proceedings[^3].

### Court’s finding on the husband’s application for the wife to undergo second mental health assessment

7       Upon review of parties’ respective positions, I found that there was a lack of evidence to prove a _prima facie_ case that the Wife has mental health issues that requires another examination. In particular, the Medical Report by the IMH dated 10 May 2018 furnished by the Wife opined that she has no mental illness. The Wife was also examined by IMH twice after that on 15th August 2018 and 13th March 2019. There were no opposing diagnosis provided from these two further appointments. According to the Wife, these two later appointments were arranged by the Husband. I was also satisfied that the Wife had replied adequately to the Husband’s assertions. Hence the summons was dismissed.

## Custody, care and control, and access to the child

### Husband’s case for custody, care and control and access

8       The Husband sought an order for sole or joint custody of the child (para 27 at page 11 of PAOM) with sole care and control to him (para 2 at page 2 of PWS). The Husband stated in his affidavit that the Wife would confine the child in the bedroom all day even though the child requires early intervention to stimulate his sensory and speech development as well as his language and social interaction skill (para 22 at page 5 of P2AM). The Husband further argued that he should have care of the child as he had paid for the child’s expenses until the time where the Wife took the child and sought refuge at a shelter. The Husband also stated that his mother was the person who looked after the child when the Wife was admitted to IMH for 9 days in 2018 (para 25 at page 8 of P2AM). The Husband stated that his family will assist in looking after the child and therefore asked for care and control to be accorded to him (para 25 at page 8 of P2AM). He also stated that he was prepared to accord the Wife with access to the child (para 27 at page 10 of P2AM).

### Wife’s case for custody, care and control and access

9       The Wife sought an order for joint custody of the child and sole care and control to her (para 6b at page 11 of DWS). The Wife’s case was that she has always been the primary caregiver for the child since his birth and they share a very close relationship with one another as a result. The Wife claimed that she continues to breastfeed the child and that he sleeps with her at night (para 6b at page 11 of DWS). The child has been residing solely with the Wife ever since she moved out from the matrimonial home on 3 February 2020. The Wife avers that she has been abiding by the OSG consent order and has been giving the Husband access to the child (para 6c at page 12 of DWS). The Wife avers that the child has a speech delay. The child does not talk and will cry when he is hungry. The Wife would have to prepare his lunch and mash the child’s food as the child does not consume solid food (para 6b at page 11 of DWS). In view of the circumstances, the Wife sought an order for joint custody of the child, with sole care and control to her. The Wife was agreeable for access to be granted to the Husband on every Saturday and Sunday for 3 hours each, and on the child’s birthday for 6 hours. The Wife was not agreeable for weekday access as she claimed that it would affect her work (para 6c at page 12 of DWS). The Husband disputed that the child has any medical issues and there were no medical evidence produced to the effect that the child has health issues.

### Court’s finding on custody, care and control and access

10     I applied the law[^4] and ordered that parties shall have joint custody and joint care of the child. In case parties cannot agree, I also ordered that for the weekdays when both parents are working, the child should stay on in the current childcare centre that he is enrolled in for continuity. As for the weekends and durations outside the daycare hours, the parties would have almost equal time with the child. Specifically, the Wife shall have the child from Saturday night to Wednesday morning and the Husband shall have the child from Wednesday after school to Saturday night. Parties may adjust the care arrangements by consent. I decided this way because it was clear to me that both parties love the child dearly. Further-more they were generally able to cooperate and carry out the daily access for the husband as agreed. I take the view that parties can take one step forward to care for the child jointly. I note the Wife’s concerns about the child’s speech delay. This was disputed by the Husband and there were nothing from any medical experts adduced on this concern. I also did not think this issue should prevent the Husband from caring for the child jointly. The joint care opportunity will allow the Husband to take on more and bond more with the child. This would also allow the Wife to have more time for self-care and plan ahead. The child is already three years old. It is not unreasonable for the Wife to wean the child off her breastmilk. The divorce has been finalized with the conclusion of the AM hearing. Both sides now need to transit to their post-divorce life. Further-more I have ordered the Husband to take on more share to maintain the child as detailed below. It would be fairer and more appropriate for the Husband to have an equal opportunity to participate in the child’s upbringing.

## Overseas travel for the child

### Wife’s submissions for child’s overseas travel

11     The Wife also sought an order for her to be able to travel with the child to India during the school holidays to visit her parents. The Wife submitted that she is an Indian citizen and she had not visited her parents since February 2017 when she relocated from India to be with the Husband. The Wife stated that the Husband had prohibited her from visiting her parents as he feared that she would not return to Singapore with the child. However, the Wife stated that this was an unfounded fear and she should be allowed to bring the child to visit her family, just as the Husband’s parent was able to bond with the child (para 6g at page 15 of DWS). The Wife highlighted that on 27 March 2020, parties entered into a consent order which provided that neither party shall bring the child out of Singapore without a Court order (para 6g at page 15 of DWS). The consent order also provided that parties were at liberty to vary this at the ancillary matters hearing (page 128 of DWS).

12     The Husband objected to the Wife’s application because the Wife was a flight risk. The Husband submitted that the Wife had threatened to bring the child back to India and disappear forever. The Husband said that the Wife came from the countryside and it would be impossible to locate the Wife and child if she really carried out her threats.

### Court’s findings on child’s overseas travel

13     I opine that the Husband’s objection was not entirely without merits. How-ever it would be unfair to completely disallow the Wife and child to travel back to India to see the maternal family. On balance, I think it will be reasonable to allow the child to travel with the Wife subject to safeguards. The Wife shall provide a banker’s guarantee of S$5,000 or equivalent if she wishes to bring the child out of Singapore.

## Division of matrimonial assets

### The matrimonial pool of assets

14     The Husband stated on affidavit that the assets held in his name are as follows: -

16     There were no joint assets listed by parties.

### Court’s finding on the division of matrimonial assets

17     With respect to the assets listed above, both sides did not make submissions for me to divide the said assets. As this was a very short marriage and most of the assets were accumulated before the marriage, there were minimal matrimonial assets to be divided. Parties did not have any real estate property and most of the assets were savings and CPF funds held in their sole names. I applied the law[^8] and found it appropriate for each party to retain the above assets in their respective sole names and possession.

## Claims over jewelry

### Husband’s claim over jewelry in wife’s possession

18     The Husband sought an order for the Wife to return the following items (para 26 at page 10 of PAOM): -

> (a)     Husband’s family gold consisting of “Thaali” necklace set, two necklaces (one with pendant), three sets of earrings, one set of bangles (two pieces), one ruby nose stud, one blue engagement saree; and

> (b)     Child’s gold consisting of one necklace with pendant and one ring.

19     In particular, the Husband argued that a wife is supposed to return her “Thaali” set to her husband after a divorce (para 26 at page 10 of P2AM). Accordingly, the Husband submitted that the Wife ought to return the “Thaali” to him. The Husband also asked for the Wife to return him a mobile phone containing a SIM card registered to the mobile number ending with 0914, as well as the keys to the wardrobe drawer (para 26 at page 10 of PAOM).

### Wife’s submission on Husband’s claim and her claim against jewelry in husband’s possession

20     The Wife stated on affidavit that the blue engagement saree was not in her possession and was still in the matrimonial flat (para 17b(1) at page 7 of DAOM). The Wife was agreeable to return the rest of the items as requested by the Husband save for the keys to the drawer which she claimed to have misplaced (para 17(b)(9) at page 8 of DAOM), and the “Thaali” set. With regards to the “Thaali” set, the Wife claimed that it was a Hindu marriage symbol given to her as a marriage gift by the Husband’s family for marriage and did not constitute a matrimonial asset (para 9c at page 22 of DWS). The Wife also sought an order for the Husband to return a chain, two bracelets and four gold rings that were in his possession. The Wife claimed that these items were third party gifts to her and did not constitute a matrimonial asset (para 9h at page 23 of DWS).

### Court’s finding on parties’ claims on jewelry

21     I applied the law[^9] and found that there was a lack of evidence to show that the “Thaali” jewelries belong to the Husband. Both sides provided affidavit evidence re the “Thaali” and they could not agree. There were no established Hindu custom or practice re this point. Next, the parties claimed the return of some jewelries belonging to each of them. I noted that the Wife was agreeable to return most of the items claimed by the Husband except the “Thaali”. However I was unable to trace a clear position from the Husband if he would return the jewelries claimed by the Wife. In view of the above, I declined to make any order regarding the return of the jewelries. Parties may retain the assets in each of their sole name and/or possession. If they wish to return them, they are also free to do so.

## Maintenance for the child and the Wife

### Parties’ income

22     The Husband stated that his monthly income was S$3,500 (para 3a at page 2 of PAOM). Based on his pay slip for May 2020 that he had tendered, it stated that his monthly basic salary was S$4,649. For that month, his take-home salary was S$3,620.93 (page 16 of PAOM).

23     The Wife furnished certain income documents that belonged to the Husband: -

> (a)     The Husband’s IRAS Notice of Assessment (NOA) for the year 2017 (dated 2 February 2018) where his total income was S$62,955 (page 37 of DAOM).

> (b)     The Husband’s IRAS NOA for the year 2018 (dated 7 May 2018) which stated that his income was S$55,319 (page 38 of DAOM).

> (c)     The Husband’s IRAS NOA for the year 2019 (dated 8 June 2019) which stated that his income was S$54,539 (page 39 of DAOM).

> (d)     The Husband’s pay slip for November 2019 stating that his basic salary was S$4,230, and his total earnings was S$4,278. His take home salary was S$3,374.68 (page 40 of DAOM).

> (e)     The Husband’s pay slip for December 2019 stating that he received a gross salary of S$8,647.15 (including AWS bonus). His net pay for that month was S$6,904.38 (page 41 of DAOM).

> (f)     The Husband’s pay slip for January 2020 stating that he received a gross salary of S$8,070.40 (including performance bonus). His net pay for that month was S$6,428.20 (page 40 of DAOM).

24     The Wife is currently unemployed. She stated that she received some short-term financial assistance from MSF and SINDA but these would all cease by November 2020 (para B(3),(4) at page 2 of DAOM).

26     The Husband stated that he has been financing the child’s expenses until the Wife and the child moved to the shelter. Even then, the Husband stated that he continued to purchase diapers, clothing, milk powder and cereal for the child (para 25 at page 9 of PAOM).

27     The Husband submitted that the Wife ought to bear 50% of the child’s monthly expenses (para 25 at page 9 of PAOM).

### Wife’s position on child’s needs and maintenance quantum

28     The Wife stated that the child’s monthly expenses are as follows (para B(13) at page 4 of DAOM): -

29     The Wife was seeking an order for the Husband to pay a monthly maintenance of S$304.75 for the child. In addition, she also asked that the Husband continues to pay for the childcare fees and other educational expenses (para 7a of at page 16 DWS).

## Maintenance for the wife

### Husband’s case for spousal maintenance

30     The Husband was willing to provide a lump sum maintenance payment of S$5,000 to the Wife. Thereafter, the Husband submitted that the Wife should not be entitled to any maintenance (para 25 at page 8 of P2AM).

31     The Husband argued that the Wife had left the matrimonial home on three separate occasions over the course of their marriage and was currently residing at a shelter. He had also raised the fact that the marriage was short (para 25 at page 9 of PAOM).

32     The Husband asked for the maintenance order under MSS 1585/2018 that stipulated for him to pay the Wife a monthly maintenance sum of S$120 to be discharged (para 25 at page 9 of PAOM).

### Wife’s case for spousal maintenance

33     The Wife is currently unemployed. However, during the marriage from November 2018 to May 2019, the Wife worked as a cashier for a stint to make ends meet. At that time, her average salary was S$820 per month (para 16h at page 6 of DAOM).

34     The Wife stated that her monthly personal expenses were as follows (para 12 at page 4 of DAOM): -

<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="9.05818836232754%"> <col width="71.5856828634273%"> <col width="19.3561287742452%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>S/N</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Item</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Amount</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Food / Groceries</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">S$151</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Transport</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">S$50</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Utilities (water, gas and electricity)</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">S$45</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Telephone bill</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">S$40</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">5.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Medical</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">S$50</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">6.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Rental for a room in the future after leaving the shelter</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">S$750</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="right" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Total</b></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">S$1,086</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

35     The Wife sought an order for the Husband to pay a sum of S$1,086 per month for a period of three years as maintenance for the wife. The Wife submitted that three years would enable her to secure employment and settle down with the child in a rental flat (para 8(6) at page 19 of DWS).

36     The Wife submitted that even though she is an Indian graduate, she is currently unemployed and would need to scout for a job. The Wife further highlighted that it was reasonable for her to seek maintenance for one room in a rental flat as opposed to renting the entire flat (para 8(3) at page 21 of DWS).

### Court’s finding on maintenance for the child and the Wife

37     I considered parties’ position on the matter and the evidence before me. I was of the view that the Husband was clearly in a stronger financial position. Relying on the annual incomes from the past few years, I found that the Husband’s average monthly gross income was around S$4800 but his take home income could be around S$ 3500 to 3800. So far, the Wife had only found work as a night cashier in a supermarket and her monthly salary was around S$820. She was an Assistant Professor in India but it was questionable if she can find a similar job in Singapore. I think it was realistic that she can only acquire a salary of about S$1,000 to S$1,500 per month in the present circumstances. Hopefully, she can build up her skills and get better work prospects.

38     In view of the above, I opined that the Husband shall continue to pay for the child’s childcare, medical, dental and related fees. He shall pay to the relevant providers directly. If this is not possible, the Wife shall seek reimbursement from the Husband. As for the child’s other living expenses, the Husband shall pay the Wife a nominal sum of S$200 per month. This was a reduced quantum as the Husband would be caring for the child too.

39     Turning to spousal maintenance, leading case law has set out that the wife’s maintenance in supplementary to divisional outcome of matrimonial assets. In the present instance, the Wife did not receive any share of the matrimonial assets. I note that the Husband had offered $5,000 lump sum maintenance. The Wife asked for about S$1,100 per month for a period of three years. This adds up to about S$39,600 in total. The Wife submitted that she needed the Husband to maintain her in order to transit to post-divorce life.

40     In view of the facts, I agreed with the Wife that the Husband should provide some support for her but I was not persuaded that the Wife should receive such support for 3 years. In view of the short duration of the marriage, I opined that it would be fair to expect the Wife to transit to a post-divorce life in 12 months’ time. I also agreed with the Wife that S$1200 per month was a reasonable quantum. How-ever the Wife would require some cash upfront in order to organize her new life. I therefore ordered the Husband to pay her a lump sum of S$3,600 which was 3 months’ maintenance and maintenance of S$1,200 per month for a period of 9 months. Thereafter, parties shall have a clean break.

41     In conclusion, this was a very unfortunate episode in both parties’ lives. I hope that they can put the unhappy past behind and place the child’s interest above all. I also ordered them to receive counselling which would hopefully provide them with the necessary support to move on. As parties had not gotten squarely what they applied for, I also decline to order costs against either side.
