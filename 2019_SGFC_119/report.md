Section 95(3)(6) and Section 95(b) of the Women’s Charter, Cap 353; Contested divorce

31 October 2019

### District Judge Jen Koh:

## Introduction

1       The Plaintiff husband (‘the husband’) having appealed my decision dismissing his writ for divorce on 2 August 2019, I now set out my reasons for my decision.

## Background to this matter

2       The parties’ marriage was an arranged marriage. They were match made by the husband’s mother through parental connections of both the husband’s family and the Defendant wife’s (‘the wife’) family in late 2010. The parties and their parents decided they were suitable for each other; they had a customary wedding in India in June 2012 and subsequently registered their marriage in Singapore in July 2012.

3       After the marriage, the parties resided with the husband’s parents in the parents’ flat at Compassville Street. To all intents and purposes, this was the matrimonial home at the material time. The parties subsequently bought their own flat at Jalan Tenteram in November 2016 but the parties did not live there as a family beyond 6 – 7 months.

4       The parties’ only child, a daughter (‘the child’), was born in November 2013. She is about 6 years old. The child is currently with the husband and his parents and they reside at the parents’ flat at Compassville Street.

5       The husband is about 39 years old and has a Masters in Engineering Management from Singapore. He works as an Air Force Engineer with the xxx. In his Statement of Claim, he lists his occupation as ‘Military Expert’. The wife is about 32 years old. She has a Masters in Political Science from India. She works as an administrative assistant in a local hospital.

## Legal proceedings

6       On 10 September 2018, the husband commenced a writ of divorce to dissolve the marriage after some 6 years on the fact that the marriage had broken down irretrievably in that the wife had behaved in such a way that he could no longer reasonably be expected to live with her.

7       In practice, this fact is coined as a defendant’s unreasonable behaviour, and in this case, that of the wife’s alleged unreasonable behaviour. In the legal context, it is not the wife’s unreasonable behaviour _per se_ ; it is a finding the Court is asked to make that it is no longer reasonable to expect the husband to continue to live with the wife. To quote Professor Leong Wai Kum in Elements of Family Law in Singapore Third Edition at paragraph \[6.073\]: “the unreasonableness does not describe the defendant’s behaviour…it instead qualifies the expectation that the plaintiff continue to live with the defendant”. I will elaborate further in my decision.

8       The wife contested the writ and filed a defence in October 2018. She did not file a counterclaim. The wife contested the allegations and sought a dismissal of the writ.

9       The matter was eventually set down for trial on a contested basis with the husband calling as witnesses his parents and a teacher from the school the child was attending. The wife relied on her own testimony. I heard the contested trial over 2 days on 4 July 2019 and 2 August 2019. I dismissed the writ on 2 August 2019 and I now set out my reasons for so doing.

## The husband’s case in his Statement of Particulars

10     In his Statement of Particulars, the husband relied on a number of incidents or events, summarized below:

> (a)     He made a general observation of the wife as someone who was domineering in nature, an irascible person prone to burst into fits of anger who started arguments with him and who made derogatory remarks.

> (b)     He referred to an incident on 19 June 2016 in which she abused him and threatened to kill their child.

> (c)     He said that she did not take an interest in the child and attempted to curtail the child’s paternal grandparents’ interactions with the child.

> (d)     He referred to an incident on 1 October 2016 in which he said that the wife refused to attend a family outing and also then threatened to kill the child as well as the husband’s mother.

> (e)     He said that the wife was irresponsible; that she did not help with the household chores and she refused to allow the husband to assist his parents.

> (f)     He referred to an incident on 28 January 2017 where the wife refused to join the family for a trip to Malaysia and then sent rude messages to him. Upon the husband’s return to Singapore, she quarrelled with him to the extent that the police had to be called.

> (g)     He said that she entered his parents’ flat without permission on 18 March 2017 leading to the police being called.

> (h)     He referred to an incident on 18 July 2018 where the wife was abusive and the parties quarrelled about how the child was not changed into her pyjamas. He accused the wife of hurting his mother and that she started to abuse his parents to such an extent that her behaviour caused the child to cry. The husband then called the police.

> (i)     That on 19 July 2018, the wife abused the maid and only left when the husband’s mother called the police.

> (j)     That the wife attempted to snatch the child away from him on 3 August 2018 and that she attempted to snatch the child away from his parents on 27 August 2018.

## Significant dates

11     Under cross-examination, the husband said that in his mind, the marriage was dead as at July 2018 and that was the date he was of the view that the marriage could no longer be salvaged. He elaborated further that notwithstanding his references to events in 2015, he conceded that there were no problems in the marriage throughout 2015 and between January and May 2016. He said the first incident that started the downward spiral of the marital relationship was in June 2016 and that the Court could ignore all events and references to incidents before June 2016. He also said that the relationship between the wife and his mother was ‘fine’ and that were ‘no problems’ between them prior to June 2016. He further said that the vulgarities and verbal abuses uttered by the wife did not lead to the breakdown of the marriage. He referred and relied on 3 incidents as causing the breakdown of the marriage: 19 June 2016, 1 October 2016 and January 2017. In his mind, the marriage died in July 2018 and the incident he referred to was one on 18 July 2018 leading him to move out completely on 19 July 2018 and to cease the marital relationship.

## Section 95(6) of the Women’s Charter Chapter 353

12     Bearing in mind his evidence on the stand, I directed counsel to Section 95(6) of the Women’s Charter Cap 353. As the section has a bearing on the facts of this case, it is pertinent to set it out:

> _“Where the plaintiff alleges that the defendant has behaved in such a way that the plaintiff cannot reasonably be expected to live with him, but the parties to the marriage have lived with each other for a period or periods after the date of the occurrence of the final incident relied on by the plaintiff and held by the court to support his allegation, that fact shall be disregarded in determining for the purpose of subsection 3(b) whether the plaintiff cannot reasonably be expected to live with the defendant if the length of that period or of those periods together was 6 months or less.”_

13     Hence, if parties lived together for a period of at least 6 months after the date of the occurrence of the final incident relied on by the husband, that incident has to be disregarded in determining the wife‘s ‘unreasonable behaviour’.

## Applying Section 95(6)

14     I raised a concern on this issue with counsel because the husband referred to incidents in 2015 and 2016 which were incidents that had exceeded the 6 months’ period referred to in paragraphs 12 and 13 above.

15     To elaborate further, in several places of the husband’s affidavit of evidence in chief (AEIC) the husband said that he worked on reconciliation with the wife and that parties attempted to salvage the marriage (see paragraphs 14, 38, 40, 43, 59 and 60 of his AEIC). According to the husband, he reconciled with the wife and parties then stayed together as a family _from June 2017_. Hence, the incidents he referred to _prior_ to June 2017 were forgiven as parties reconciled and in any event, exceeded the 6 month period referred to in Section 95(6) as the parties stayed together until the husband moved out in July 2018, specifically, 19 July 2018.

16     In any event, according to the husband, the marriage did not appear to suffer any major incidents until an incident which the husband said occurred in December 2017 as set out in paragraph 61 of his AEIC. In December 2017, the husband said that the wife threw temper tantrums and shouted at the child, his parents and himself and that she also vented her temper at the domestic helper. The husband also said the wife uttered vulgarities and insults at him. Bearing in mind Section 95(6) of the Charter, the husband’s case of the wife’s unreasonable behaviour must, on application of Section 95(6) of the Charter as well as his evidence of reconciliation, be premised on events occurring _after_ December 2017.

17     I explain: Any incidents he referred to prior to December 2017 would have been forgiven/condoned with his staying on in the marriage with the wife, continuing in the marriage and specifically, _reconciling_ with her. The weight to be placed on incidents prior to December 2017 would be minimal in the circumstances, if at all, bearing in mind the applicability of Section 95(6).

18     For the reasons articulated in paragraphs 14 to 17, this meant that the husband’s Statement of Particulars, in paragraphs 1(I)(K)(L)(M)(Q)(R)(S)(T)(U) were to be disregarded. The incidents referred to in these paragraphs were of events occurring on 19 June 2016, 1 October 2016, 3 October 2016, 20 October 2016, 28 January 2017, 18 March 2017, 4 June 2017 and his general reference to events in 2017. This meant that the following paragraphs in his AEIC were also to be disregarded: 19, 32 to 61.

19     As the husband conceded on the stand that the wife’s use of vulgarities (denied by the wife) did not cause the breakdown of the marriage (see paragraph 11 above), the following paragraphs and exhibits were to be disregarded: paragraphs 21 to 30 and pages 87 to 107 of his AEIC.

## The husband’s case against the wife

20     Hence, to prove his case, the husband had to rely on incidents occurring between December 2017 and 19 July 2018.

21     On the stand, the husband said he would confine himself to 3 incidents (see paragraph 11 above). To recapitulate, these were incidents occurring on 19 June 2016, 1 October 2016 and January 2017. However, in view of the matters raised in paragraphs 12 to 19 above, the husband could only rely on the incidents occurring _after December 2017_ as parties stayed together for a period of 6 months from December 2017 until he left in July 2018.

22     The husband also said that he separated from the wife on 3 periods (a) 1 to 20 October 2016 (b) 29 January 2017 to 3 June 2017 and (c) from 19 July 2018. For the periods set out in (a) and (b), again with the reconciliation and the husband resuming cohabitation with the wife, these periods were disregarded.

23     Accordingly, there was no need for the Court to examine 2 out of the 3 incidents referred to by the husband save for (c), the incident in July 2018. (a) and (b) could not be relied upon to cause the breakdown of the marriage as they were incidents in June and October 2016 and January 2017. For the incidents in October 2016, the husband returned to resume cohabitation with the wife and reconciled with her after getting her relative to speak with her. He could not rely on these incidents because of Section 95(6) and also because of the reconciliation that was effected when the wife was invited back into the matrimonial home (then at the husband’s parents’ flat) after 20 October 2016. He could not rely on the incident in January 2017 for the same reasons and he specifically affirmed that he reconciled with the wife and that again parties stayed together from 4 June 2017.

24     The incident that the husband _could_ rely on as his allegation of the wife’s unreasonable behaviour which led to the breakdown of the marriage was therefore the incidents on 18 and 19 July 2018.

25     In his AEIC, he also referred to further events after he left the wife. These were the incidents of 3 August 2018, 27 August 2018 and 20 October 2018. A caveat here: after 18 July 2018, the parties no longer lived together and as such, the events after 18 July 2018 referred to by the husband could not be said to have made it unreasonable for the husband to continue to live with the wife as set out in Section 95(3)(b). He had moved out and commenced proceedings in September 2018. He was no longer staying with her.

26     In any event, I considered all the matters raised by the husband after December 2017.

#### 18 - 19 July 2018

27     This incident referred to by the husband occurred on the husband’s mother’s birthday. The wife said she was tired and did not want to attend the dinner party that had been arranged on the evening of 18 July 2018. The rest of the family went ahead without her. Upon their return, the husband noticed that the child was still unchanged as at 10 pm and asked the wife why that was so. To this, he said that the wife reacted angrily and started screaming. He said that the child then ran to his parents and the wife then started abusing his parents verbally. He said that as his mother was walking back to her room, the wife suddenly pushed her and that she also tried to pull the child off the bed of his parents’ room. As for 19 July 2018, he said that the wife abused the domestic helper and shouted at him before leaving the home.

28     In cross-examination, with regard the incident on 18 July 2018, the husband said that they did not file a police report and that neither himself nor his mother filed an application for a personal protection order (PPO). Eventually, it was the husband’s father who filed the PPO application but that application was also not proceeded with. The husband then moved out with the child and his parents on 19 July 2018.

29     Cross-examination centred on the events of this date, the videographing of the incidents and exhibit PS1. The wife’s position was that she was angry and hurt by what she had learnt on reading the husband’s handphone and on seeing the husband’s mother’s text messages to the husband telling him to treat the wife in a certain manner. The wife also discovered that food she had bought for personal consumption had been hidden away. She said that she reacted angrily because of what she learnt and she sought corroboration from the domestic helper whom she said had always been kind to her. She wanted to understand why the husband’s mother was ‘teaching’ her son how to behave towards her in his marriage. She denied hurting the husband’s mother or hurting the child.

30     She said that the husband’s parents were keeping the child from her and that the quarrel centered around her pleas for them to cease their bullying ways and to allow her to be with her child. She wanted the child to sleep with her but was prevented by the husband and his mother. She denied trying to pull the child away from the husband’s mother or causing hurt to the child. The child was then taken away by the domestic helper into her room at the husband’s mother’s instructions. The husband’s mother was subsequently in the domestic helper’s room and refused to allow her to take her child. She said it was the husband’s mother who pushed her. The wife eventually slept with the domestic helper and the child in the domestic helper’s room.

31     Counsel cross-examined her further and asked her to confirm that paramedics came into the home to examine the husband’s mother. This was not denied by the wife.

32     Counsel brought the Court to the video recording. On review, from stills taken from the videographing, the events that could be ascertained were :

> (a)     The domestic helper bringing the child to her (domestic helper’s) room.

> (b)     The wife speaking to the family who were seated on the sofas of the living room.

#### Court’s decision on this incident of 18-19 July 2018

33     I considered the parties’ accounts of the incident and made the following observations:

> (a)     The husband and his parents were not overtly affected by the wife’s conduct when she spoke with them in the living room. The three of them remained seated and were calm whilst the wife was seen talking to them, asking why they carried on the way they did, why she could not have her child sleep with her and why they hid her food/milk etc.

> (b)     The wife’s voice was raised on occasions but this was consistent with her pleas to them for explanations of their behaviour; the three of them largely ignored her.

> (c)     The wife did not manage to retrieve her child from either the husband’s mother or the domestic helper.

> (d)     The wife spent the night with the child in the domestic helper’s room.

34     The questions that his counsel asked of the wife did not assist the husband’s case. Examples of this:

> (i)     “Why did you (the wife) not exhibit the husband’s messages that you said you saw about the mother in law telling him not to invite you for her dinner, not to bring you out etc” When it was pointed out that she did not have access to them, and that they were within his client’s possession, counsel dropped the line of cross-examination.

> (ii)     “Did you abuse your in-laws?” and when the wife replied that she asked them why they taught her daughter not to hug her, why they told the domestic helper not to give her food, counsel ceased his line of cross-examination.

> (iii)     “Why did your mother-in-law ask the domestic helper to take the child away?” and when the wife explained that all 3 of them ‘ganged up’ against her and as there were 3 of them, she could not possibly stop the husband’s mother from giving orders to the domestic helper, counsel also did not pursue the line of cross-examination further.

35     The wife was asked if she was ‘mad’ with the husband’s mother as a result; she replied that she was upset and hurt by her (the latter’s) behaviour.

36     With regard the incident on 19 July 2018, the wife denied shouting or abusing the domestic helper. According to her, the domestic helper and she had a good relationship and they were discussing the events of 18 July 2018. She also said that she did not leave the home (in the sense of walking out); rather she went to work as her hours of work were 8 am to 5.30 pm.

37     In considering the incident of 18 July 2018 and deciding whether this incident could be demonstrative of the wife’s unreasonable behaviour to the extent that the husband could no longer reasonably be expected to live with her, I looked at the evidence and the findings as set out above. On a balance of probability, I could not agree with the husband that this incident caused the breakdown of the marriage. I set out some reasons for my findings:

> (a)     The wife had reasonable cause to be upset with the husband and his parents.

> (b)     The husband and his parents were noticeably calm when the wife was questioning them.

> (c)     This appeared to be a situational conflict.

> (d)     I accepted that the wife would be upset in the circumstances of the case.

> (e)     It was also telling that although the husband tried to make a point that the child was afraid of the wife, the child slept with the wife and the domestic helper. The child did not for example, run off to the husband or her grandparents’ room.

> (f)     Although the husband’s mother was seen by paramedics and said she was abused, there was no application by the husband (for the child) and by the mother for a PPO.

38     I accepted the wife’s explanation and agreed with her counsel that this incident could not be said to have cast the wife in an unreasonable light. She reacted to the conduct of the 3 other adults in the home.

39     The incident on 19 July 2018 was also insignificant and the husband did not seem to have relied on the incident as one that caused the breakdown of the marriage.

#### Incidents after the husband had left the home and no longer stayed with the wife

40     Three other incidents had been raised by the husband in pleadings – 3 August 2018, 27 August 2018 and 20 October 2018. A note here. By this time, in accordance with the husband’s testimony, he had formed the view that the marriage was over and he could no longer reasonably be expected to live with the wife _as at 18-19 July 2018_. The incidents he referred to in this section occurred _after_ the date of separation and _after_ he had formed a decision not to live with the wife. Again, the weight to be placed on these incidents would be minimal if at all - the test in Section 95(3)(b) would not be discharged as the parties were already living apart as the husband had concluded that he could no longer live with the wife _as at 19 July 2018_.

41     In any event, for completeness, I would mention these incidents briefly and set out my findings.

#### The incident on 3 August 2018

42     The husband was informed by his mother that the wife had gone to the child’ s school and that the wife attempted to snatch the child. He rushed to the kindergarten to find the child crying. The police had been called by the school and they asked the child whether she wanted to go to the wife. The child said no and the husband then left with the child. The husband said he was mentally anguished by the incident.

43     In support of the husband’s case, the husband’s mother filed an affidavit as well as gave evidence of the event. The evidence revealed that the husband’s mother was the principal of the school. Under cross-examination she was asked why the school called the husband. She said that the school refused the wife access to her child in the school as she claimed that she received a note from the child’s father restricting access of the child to the wife. She said that she acted under instruction of the note from the husband.

44     The wife denied that she tried to snatch the child from school. She had been blocked from any contact with the child since the husband and his parents left the home with the child on 19 July 2018.

#### My findings of this incident

45     I disagreed that the husband would suffer from mental anguish as a result of the wife attempting to see the child whom she had no contact with for nearly 3 weeks or so. The husband and his parents did not deny that the wife was not permitted contact with the child. The husband’s mother, as principal of the school the child was at, made a decision to listen to the views of one parent – the husband, who happened to be her son. She could not explain why in the absence of a Court order she would do so. The irresistible conclusion was the concerted joint effort to stop the wife’s contact with the child at one parent’s unilateral instructions.

46     As the wife was not permitted any contact with the child, the husband’s reference to his being in “much mental anguish” as a result of this one incident would appear to be contrived in the circumstances of the case. The child was physically with him and his parents since 19 July 2018. The child’s school was headed by his mother, whose interests were aligned with his. I did not see the wife’s conduct in wanting to see her child after a nearly 3 weeks no contact to be unreasonable warranting a grant of divorce in the husband’s favour.

#### The incident of 27 August 2018

47     The husband was not physically present when the incident occurred. According to his parents, they were at a bank when the wife appeared and tried to snatch the child out of his father’s arms. The tussle led to the father allegedly falling and a CISCO guard from the bank came out to assist the parties. The CISCO guard assisted the husband’s parents to leave the area with the child. The father subsequently made a police report and filed an application for a PPO. This was not proceeded with.

48     The wife said this was a chance encounter and that she chanced upon the parents at the bank. She approached them and called to the child but the husband’s father clutched the child and refused to let her touch the child. She denied that she pushed the father and said that she could not have done as the child was in his arms.

#### My findings of this incident

49     This was a chance encounter and the wife, having not seen the child for about 6 weeks or more then approached the parents to speak with and to touch the child. She was prevented from so doing by the father who held on to the child.

50     The husband was not at the scene and at best, his reaction to the wife’s alleged unreasonable conduct would be premised on what he was told by his parents. It is trite law that the behaviour of a defendant towards another could possibly have an impact on the plaintiff. The husband’s assertion about this incident however, was about the wife’s attempts at snatching the child. He said that the attempts had adversely affected the child. He did not develop a case as to how the wife’s conduct against his parents made her so unreasonable that he could no longer reasonably be expected to live with her. For him, it was an “access” issue.

51     The husband’s father also did not pursue the application for a PPO. The husband himself did not file an application for custody of the child or for the child to remain in his care pending the hearing of the ancillary matters. In fact, it was the wife who filed the application for custody in November 2018.

52     Again, this incident was situational at best and confined to it facts. It could not be said that the wife’s conduct of wanting to see the child, who had been kept from her for about 6 weeks by then, to be unreasonable. Neither did the husband link it to himself nor how he found it unreasonable and I refer to paragraph 50 above.

#### The incident of 20 October 2018

53     The husband said that he was attending a school concert and the wife turned up. The wife went close to the child on stage and this caused the child to cry. The husband also elicited evidence from one of the teachers who said that the child did not want to go to the wife.

54     The wife said that she only wanted to see the child as she had not seen the child for 3 months by this time. She said that the child was not frightened of her. It was a reaction to what was happening.

#### My findings of this incident

55     Again, the husband has not linked this incident to why he found the wife’s conduct to be unreasonable nor why and how it caused the breakdown of the marriage. His recounting of the event appeared to be centered on the issues pertaining to the child. The teacher who gave evidence did not assist the Court as she acted on the instruction of the principal (the husband’s mother) as well as that of the husband.

## Summary of the incidents relied on by the husband

56     I recapitulate the evidence before I set out my conclusions because of certain indisputable matters that must be taken into account:

> (a)     Because of the husband’s position on the witness stand, all incidents and events occurring _before June 2016_ were to be ignored as he confirmed that these did not cause the breakdown of the marriage. This would be the incidents at pages73 to 86 of his AEIC. In any event, these events were “caught” under the provisions of Section 95(6).

> (b)     Incidents and events that occurred prior to parties’ reconciliation were to be disregarded and this would be paragraphs 14, 38, 40, 43, 59 and 60 of his AEIC as he forgave the wife.

> (c)     Incidents referred to by the husband to be disregarded or to accord little or no weight: sale of his car in June 2016, vulgarities and abuses uttered before June 2016, incident of October 2016, incident of December 2016, even the incident in January 2017 (see paragraph 59 of his AEIC) and all incidents referred to by the husband between that period up to December 2017. This would also include all exhibits by the husband in his AEIC at pages 87 to 107.

> (d)     I could possibly have considered matters raised by the husband from December 2017/January 2018 but the husband said that the vulgarities and abuses uttered by the wife (denied by her) did not cause the breakdown of the marriage. This would include exhibits by the husband in his AEIC at pages 107 to 139 insofar as they refer to his allegation on this issue.

> (e)     Hence, I could only considered the incident of July 2018 to determine whether it would be adequate to satisfy Section 95(3)(b).

> (f)     As for the incidents occurring after July 2018, I refer to paragraph 40 above.

57     This was also not a case in which I considered the cumulative complaints of the wife’s conduct raised by the husband to determine if they could have caused the breakdown of the marriage. Not only was this not relied on by the husband but more pertinently, could not have been relied on by the husband because he reconciled with the wife on several occasions and he took pains to detail this. There was a conscious and considered decision on his part as he left the wife on three separate occasions, forgave her, reconciled with her _and_ resumed cohabitation with her as a married couple.

58     Hence, coupled with Section 95(6) as well as the second limb of Section 95(3)(b) (discussed earlier), the husband had created a stringent situation in which he could only rely on the incidents of 18 and 19 July 2018.

59     I had set out my findings and reasons for dismissal of the writ in this decision. I now consider DS1.

## DS1

60     The wife’s counsel cross-examined the husband on DS1 which was a series of photos and transcripts. The transcripts recorded the husband going to the matrimonial flat occupied by the wife after the separation of 19 July 2018 and post events.

61     The husband was cross-examined on the number of times he had gone to the matrimonial flat, notwithstanding the position that he had taken that he could no longer continue with the marriage from July 2018. When asked about his attendances at the matrimonial flat, he prevaricated and denied the events. He first said he could not remember; then he said the wife had asked him to come up to the matrimonial flat and then that the wife sent him vulgar photos of herself in different stages of undress and asked him to have sexual relations with her. He said this could possibly be on 1 August 2018.

62     He was then given a series of dates in which he did go to the matrimonial flat: 19 February 2019, 12 March 2019, 16 March 2019, 21 March 2019, 22 March 2019, 23 March 2019, 24 March 2019, 30 March 2019, 1 April 2019, 20 April 2019, 25 April 2019, 31 May 2019 – all with specific timings.

63     To all these specific dates and times, the husband’s reply was that he could not remember. After further cross-examination, he then changed his position and said that he went to the matrimonial flat once a month but that the wife was not necessarily always at home; that the matrimonial flat was padlocked and that she needed to be home to allow him in and that he had to ask for her permission to go into the home to collect his letters.

64     Whilst he first said he could not remember the dates, he finally conceded that he did go to the home on 31 May 2019 and that between 1 August 2018 and 31 May 2019 he had gone once or twice including the 31 May 2019 visit.

65     He was then asked if the parties had conjugal relations. The husband denied this and claimed that the wife tried to entice him but that he resisted. He was then cross-examined on the transcripts and the possibility that he was lying in view of the words in the transcripts “you give me good one” “no need to rush, just come and suck or whatever you want to do” and “come to the center” and when he discovered the camera “you are not getting today”. In reply, the husband did not explain the words he spoke save to say that he “misspoke”.

66     He was cross-examined as to why he stayed on in the home if indeed he was there to collect the letters and after he had confirmed there were no letters. His evidence was clouded on this issue and he could not explain save to say his wife invited him.

67     The evidence that unfolded did point to the reality of the couple having sexual relations or about to have sexual relations and it was only after the husband was made aware of the possibility of his being filmed/taped that he left without his shirt as evidenced in the photographs of DS1.

68     The fact that the couple continued to have sexual relations after the husband left the wife and their banter as evidenced in DS1 was relied on by the wife to support her defence that the marriage had not broken down irretrievably and that it was not caused by her unreasonable conduct. I discuss this further at paragraphs 73 to 75 hereinafter.

## The legal principles

69     Other than a consideration of Section 95(6) and the second limb of Section 95(3)(b), I also considered the legal principles set out in the case of _Wong Siew Boey_ v _Lee Boon Fatt_ \[1994\] 1 SLR 323. To summarize, whether or not a defendant had behaved in such a way that a plaintiff could no longer reasonably be expected with him/her was premised on the following principles:

> (a)     It is a finding of fact.

> (b)     The question whether the husband finds it intolerable to live with wife is a subjective one but the test is an objective one and in dealing with this, it is for the Court and not the husband to answer.

> (c)     The Court however is asked to consider the personalities of the individuals before it however far removed from the theoretical form and the Court assesses the impact of the wife’s conduct on this particular husband in the light of the whole history of the marriage and their relationship.

> (d)     The Court looks at the totality of the evidence by looking at the incidents cumulatively.

70     In setting out my reasons in this decision, I had considered the legal principles and applied the same to the facts of this case. The consideration of the entire history of the marriage and the cumulative effects of the incidents have also been considered against the backdrop of the factual matrix of this particular case.

## Witnesses’ demeanours and other considerations

71     I now consider the personalities of the individuals before me and assess whether the wife’s conduct was such that the impacted this husband to the extent as set out.

72     As the trial judge, I had the benefit of assessing the parties and their demeanours.

73     I found the husband to be a sharp and bright witness. He was not distressed or emotionally affected when on the stand and remained calm and gave his answers in a deliberate manner. However when he was confronted with DS1, something he was not adequately prepared for, he was evasive with regard to his visits to the wife and the purpose thereof. If indeed it was a matter of letter collection, there were many ways to arrange this without him having to go up to the residence. For him to allege that the wife who managed to wrangle his top off was also a misnomer of sorts given the disparity of their sizes and that must be taken in context – the parties’ heights are disparate and the wife is of a diminutive stature compared to the husband. He also did not cavil at following the wife into the home and into the bedroom. It was not difficult to conclude that he undressed willingly or with little persuasion. The wife could not have undressed the husband without some degree of co-operation on the husband’s part.

74     In cross-examination, his counsel led evidence that it was the wife who sent photos of herself and texts to the husband in order to seduce him. I did not find this helpful at all. Whether or not she did so had no bearing on whether he succumbed. He said he did not; she said he did. On the evidence before me, on a balance of probability, sexual intercourse did take place and this was corroborated with DS1.

75     The incidents of going to see the wife at the home and the ensuing sexual relations that occurred as well as his conduct on the stand showed that this was not a plaintiff who had been abused or was affected by the wife’s alleged conduct to the extent that he found it intolerable to live with the wife. The facts did not support the contention.

76     As for the husband’s mother, she was not the frail or physically weak elder woman she sought to portray. She is greater in stature compared to the wife and she is the head of a child care school. She was not the victim that she attempted to portray and I could not accept on a balance of probability that the wife could have pushed her as alleged with 3 other adults in the house, 2 of whom were aligned against the wife or at least supportive of the mother. The video as well as the stills showed that even after the alleged 1st incident of being pushed, the 3 other adults sat calmly in the living room whilst the wife was allegedly abusing them. The video and the stills did not show that they were emotionally anguished or traumatized by this.

77     The husband’s mother was also evasive on the stand when she was questioned with regard to arranging outings without the wife and she tended to be flippant with answers such as “this is their lives” “it is not for me to say anything” but this did not gel with the incidents relied upon. Under cross-examination, when asked by the wife’s counsel who started a question “as the child’s mother” (referring to the wife), the latter snapped back “But I am the child’s grandmother”. This was telling of the way that she had conducted herself.

78     It was also telling that she refused the wife access to the child in the school, claiming that she received a note from the child’s father restricting access for the wife. This was despite the fact that there were no orders governing access or custody at the pertinent time and that there was no cogent reason why she should act on a note from the husband and not considered the wife’s position as the child’s mother _save for the fact_ that the husband is her son and their interests were aligned. It did not assist when the teacher came to the stand and said that the principal of the child’s school had received instructions on this issue. No one would state that the principal of the school was the child’s paternal grandmother and that the husband is her son. It took cross-examination by the wife’s counsel for these facts to be stated on the stand.

79     The husband’s father did not add to clarify the situation as he merely echoed the husband and his wife’s position when it came to incidents involving the wife. The main incident that occurred was an alleged tussle between him and the wife when the wife reached out for contact of the child. He also did not pursue his application for a PPO whilst alleging that he sustained injuries caused by the wife. I did not find him a credible witness as he merely echoed the answers that had been given by the husband and his wife. He was not convincing in his testimony as he merely repeated all that had been said by the husband and his own wife. His testimony was a little coached and did not ring of sincerity on stand.

## My conclusions

80     Taken holistically, we have a case of a wife who was afflicted on all fronts by the husband and his parents and their helper (by omission – she apparently acted on instructions of the husband’s mother) – 4 adults who seemed to have taken the stance to alienate her from her child and to control her marriage with the husband. In that context, I reviewed the incidents referred by the husband and I am being asked to make a finding that the wife had behaved in such a way that the husband could not reasonably be expected to live with her.

81     In consideration of all the matters I had raised here, I was satisfied that the wife had discharged the evidential burden on her and adequately explained her struggles in the marriage resisting the plans of the husband and/or his mother with regard the way that the marriage was to be conducted. I was not satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that it was her conduct and behaviour that caused the breakdown of the marriage.

82     It was also worth mentioning that the wife had been removed from the parent’s flat on the fact that it was owned in the names of the husband’s parents. There was no dispute that this was the parties’ matrimonial home at the material time and the actions of the husband and his family gave me cause to consider that the wife acted the way she did in good defence.

83     It was also disheartening to learn that she was denied access to her child despite the fact that she is the child’s mother and this was supposedly at instructions of the husband and carried out by the husband’s parents to the extent of being unable to see the child even in school. The control of access was unilateral and without the weight of a Court order. I viewed the wife’s actions in wanting access in the context of a mother who was driven to the brink but still was unable to see the child because of the control exerted by the husband and his parents, all without the legitimacy of a Court order.

84     Finally, bearing in mind the significant dates and timeframes I had set out for the purposes of Section 95(6), the failure of the husband to satisfy the second limb of Section 95(3)(b) and the findings I made on the incidents he could possibly rely on, I was not satisfied that the husband could prove his case.

85     I therefore dismissed the writ with costs to the wife.

86     Costs was argued and finally fixed at $8,000 with disbursements to the wife. This took into account the number of affidavits, exhibits such as video recordings and transcripts and the number of Court attendances.
