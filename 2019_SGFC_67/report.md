Family Law – Maintenance for children; Maintenance for Wife; Division of matrimonial property

26 June 2019

### District Judge Christine Lee:

### Introduction

1       The present appeal is by the Husband against the portion of the Court’s decision made on 15 March 2019 regarding the issues of the maintenance payable for the 2 children of the marriage, as well as the maintenance payable for the Wife and percentage division of the matrimonial property.

### Background

2       The Plaintiff Husband (“the Appellant Husband”) and the Defendant Wife (“the Respondent Wife”) married on xx xxx 2008 in Singapore. There are two (2) children of the marriage namely, xxm (m) DOB xx xxx 2011 now aged 7+ years old and xxf (f) DOB xx xxx 2014 now aged nearly 5 years old (“the said 2 children”).

3       The marriage lasted about 9 years before the Appellant Husband filed Writ of Divorce on 28 April 2017. The Respondent Wife filed her Counterclaim on 5 July 2017 which was amended on 19 October 2017.

4       The divorce proceeding was set down on an uncontested basis based on both the Statement of Claim and Counterclaim (Amendment No 1 dated 19 October 2017). CFRC Certificate was issued on 11 October 2017.

5       On 20 November 2017, Interim Judgement (IJ) was granted based on the fact that the Appellant Husband had sufficiently proven the contents of the Statement of Claim and the Respondent Wife had sufficiently proven the contents of the Counterclaim (Amendment No 1 dated 19 October 2017) and the marriage was dissolved by reason that the Respondent Wife had behaved in such a way that the Appellant Husband could not reasonably be expected to live with the Respondent Wife and that the Appellant Husband had behaved in such a way that the Respondent Wife could not reasonably be expected to live with the Appellant Husband.

### Hearings before the Court

6       According to the Statement of Claim and Counterclaim (Amendment No 1 dated 19 October 2017), there were 8 Ancillary Matters (AM) to be decided by the Court. These were:

i.     Custody, care and control of the said 2 children;

ii.     Access to the said 2 children;

iii.     Maintenance for the said 2 children;

iv.     Maintenance for the Respondent Wife;

v.     Division of matrimonial assets;

vi.     Division of the matrimonial property;

vii.     Costs and

viii.     Other Relief

7       The Court dealt with the AMs of this case on two hearing days namely, 14 February 2019 and 15 March 2019 whereupon the Court delivered its decision.

8       The Appellant Husband filed Notice of Appeal on 27 March 2019 in HCF/DCA 30/2019 against four paragraphs of the Court Order (“the said Court Order”) issued on 15 March 2019.

### The Appeal

9       The Appellant Husband is appealing against paragraphs 15, 19, 20 and 25 of the said Court Order which provisions are set out below:

**Paragraphs 15 and 19 of the said Court Order:**

**Maintenance for the said 2 children**

15.    The \[Appellant Husband\] is to make payment of the sum of $3,300 per month for maintenance of the said 2 children being $1,750 for the elder child and $1,550 for the younger child. Payment to take effect from 31 March 2019 and thereafter on the last day of each month.

19.    The \[Appellant Husband\] shall continue to fully pay for the said 2 children’s insurance policy premiums directly to the insurance companies.

**Paragraph 20 of the said Court Order:**

**Maintenance for the \[Respondent Wife\]**

20.    The \[Appellant Husband\] shall also make payment of maintenance to the \[Respondent Wife\] in the sum of $1,000 per month for five (5) years until 2024. Payment to also take effect from 31 March 2019 and thereafter on the last day of each month.

**Paragraph 25 of the said Court Order:**

Division of the matrimonial property

25.    Upon successful sale, the Parties’ share of the matrimonial property shall be apportioned as follows: \[Appellant Husband\] – **55%** and \[Respondent Wife\] – **45% of the net proceeds.**

### Summary of the Court’s reasons for making its Order

## Payment of maintenance for the said 2 children

10     In making its decision on the monthly maintenance to be paid by the Appellant Husband for the said 2 children, the Court noted that there was a previous order for interim maintenance for the said 2 children issued under MSS xxx/2017 dated xx March 2017 (“interim maintenance court order”). Under this interim maintenance court order, the Appellant Husband was ordered to pay the sum of $1,600 per month as maintenance for the said 2 children as well as 100% of:

i.     their educational expenses

ii.     their medical expenses not covered by his employer

iii.     the home/mobile phone/Internet bills for the matrimonial home

iv.     utility bills for the matrimonial home

v.     conservancy charges for the matrimonial home

vi.     their insurance premiums and

vii.     helper’s salary and levy at $620 per month.

11     In the Court’s view, the previous court order for the payment of the monthly maintenance for the said 2 children was only an interim order and the Court proceeded to make a fresh assessment of the monthly maintenance for the said 2 children that was to be payable by the Appellant Husband. As such, the Court considered _inter alia_, both Parties’ income capacity as at the date of the AM hearing, as one of the factors in making this assessment.

12     The Court noted that the Appellant Husband’s income was $12,381 nett per month as an Air Force pilot. His declared monthly expenses were in the sum of $8,835.46 inclusive of the said 2 children’s expenses. In contrast, the Respondent Wife’s income was $2,583 nett per month as a Senior Analyst whilst the Respondent Wife’s declared monthly expenses was at $2,538.

13     This meant that the Appellant Husband’s disposable income was around $3,546 per month (being $12,381 - $8,835) as compared to the Respondent Wife’s disposable income of about $45 per month (being $2,583 - $2,538).

14     The Court further noted that the Respondent Wife had estimated that the said 2 children’s total monthly expenses were in the sum of $1,640 (for xxm) and $1,286 (for xxf) and that she wanted the Appellant Husband to pay $2,000 per month as maintenance for the said 2 children in addition to the 7 items covered under the interim maintenance court order issued under MSS xxx/2017.

15     Following the Court’s direction to Counsel to provide further information regarding the apportionment of the said 2 children’s share of the rental and helper’s expenses, the Respondent Wife revised her claim to seek the sum of $3,751 per month for the said 2 children’s monthly maintenance as well as 83% of their medical and educational expenses from the Appellant Husband.

16     The Court also considered the Appellant Husband’s proposal that he should henceforth only bear 80% of said 2 children’s expenses with the Respondent Wife bearing the remaining 20% save for the helper’s salary and levy which he disputed paying.

17     The Court agreed with the Appellant Husband that he should henceforth bear 80% of the monthly expenses of the said 2 children as well for their education and medical/dental expenses. However, the Court’s assessment of the said 2 children’s monthly expenses was as follows:

For xxm:

i.     Food & Groceries in the sum of $400

ii.     Pocket Money/School allowance of $100

iii.     Eating Out at $200

iv.     Clothing at $200

v.     Public Transport at $50

vi.     Miscellaneous at $300

vii.     Apportioned share of rental at $733

viii.     Apportioned share for helper at $203

Total for xxm was therefore in the sum of $2,186 and the Appellant Husband’s 80% share would be $1,748.80 rounded to $1,750.

For xxf:

i.     Food & Groceries in the sum of $300

ii.     Eating Out at $200

iii.     Clothing at $200

iv.     Public Transport at $50

v.     Miscellaneous at $250

vi.     Apportioned share of rental at $733

vii.     Apportioned share for helper at $203

Total for xxf was therefore in the sum of $1,936 and the Appellant Husband’s 80% share would be $1,548.80 rounded to $1,550.

18     The Court therefore assessed that the Appellant Husband was to pay monthly maintenance for the said 2 children in the total sum of $3,300 per month ($1,750 + $1,550).

19     In contrast to what the Appellant Husband had been paying under the interim maintenance court order issued under MSS xxx/2017, whilst the Court had increased the base sum of $1,600 per month to $3,300 per month as maintenance for the said 2 children, the Court had amalgamated what the Appellant Husband had previously been paying for the items (iii) home/mobile phone/Internet bills; (iv) utility bills; and (v) conservancy charges under MSS xxx/2017. This was included under the item ‘Miscellaneous’ in the Court’s assessment as set out in paragraph 17 above.

20     Therefore, the base sum for the said 2 children’s monthly maintenance was only increased by $100 from $1,600 to $1,700 being items (i) to (v) for xxm (total $950) and items (i) to (iv) for xxf (total $750) as set out in paragraph 17 above.

21     In addition, the Court had also reduced the Appellant Husband’s liability to pay 100% for the said 2 children’s education and medical expenses under the interim maintenance court order to 80% in a separate provision (see paragraphs 17 and 18 of the said Court Order).

22     Finally, whilst the Court had included the said 2 children’s share of the rental for their new home and the expenses of a helper which the Court considered necessary, so that the Respondent Wife could continue to work, the Court had also apportioned the Appellant Husband’s liability to 80%, thus balancing out the Appellant Husband’s maintenance payments for the said 2 children each month.

23     The Court also ordered that the Appellant Husband should continue to fully pay for the said 2 children’s insurance policy premiums directly to the insurance companies as he was already making such payments under the interim maintenance court order and the Court was of the view that these insurance policy premiums were essential for the said 2 children’s needs and welfare.

## Payment of maintenance to the Respondent Wife

24     The Respondent Wife had asked for maintenance in the sum of $1,000 per month for 4 years to enable her to address her immediate financial needs. The Appellant Husband submitted that she was not entitled to any payment of monthly maintenance.

25     The Court was informed that the Appellant Husband had previously given the Respondent Wife an allowance of $2,000 which was increased to $3,000 in May 2013 until the Appellant Husband stopped paying this allowance in April 2016 when the marriage broke down completely. That was why the Respondent Wife had to start working.

26     The Court was of the view that it was reasonable for the Appellant Husband to pay maintenance in the sum of $1,000 per month for 5 years to the Respondent Wife. This was for the transient period to allow the Respondent Wife some time to stabilise her finances after the divorce.

27     In particular, the Court noted that the Respondent Wife had been awarded care and control of the said 2 children and was of the view that she would need financial assistance until she could stabilise her financial situation post the divorce proceedings.

## Division of the matrimonial property

28     The matrimonial home was property at xxx (“the MH”). The Court noted that the marriage had lasted about 9 years and that from 2008 to 2016, the Respondent Wife was a home maker including when the Parties had lived abroad. However, it was not disputed that the Respondent Wife started working from 2016. Therefore, the Court found that this was a dual income marriage and the structured approach in _ANJ vs ANK_ \[2015\] SGCA 34 applied.

29     As such, the Court took into account the direct and indirect contributions made by both Parties and the other financial contributions listed in their respective Affidavits of Assets and Means and in the written submissions.

30     The Appellant Husband asked for the sale of MH in the open market within 6 months of Final Judgement and for the proceeds to be divided in the proportion of 70% to the Appellant Husband and 30% to the Respondent Wife after repayment of the balance of the housing loan. The Appellant Husband also asked that the Parties make the refunds of the monies utilised from their Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) accounts for the purchase of the MH from their respective shares after the division of the proceeds.

31     The Appellant Husband’s Counsel submitted that the above proportion was based on the the Appellant Husband’s Direct Contributions (“DC”) of 91.78% with 8.22% DC by the Respondent Wife and the Appellant Husband’s Indirect Contributions (“IC”) of 50% with 50% by the Respondent Wife. The Appellant Husband’s Counsel further submitted that there be equal weightage ratio for DC vs IC.

32     The Respondent Wife’s Counsel submitted that the Respondent Wife’s DC was 16% with 84% for the Appellant Husband and that her IC was 70% with 30% for the Appellant Husband. The Respondent Wife’s Counsel agreed that there be equal weightage ratio for DC vs IC.

33     The Respondent Wife asked for a fair and equitable division of the MH after taking into account the total pool of matrimonial assets (i.e. to increase the Respondent Wife’s share by 10% after taking into account the adverse inference to be drawn against the Appellant Husband which was disputed). The Respondent Wife’s final position was that she agreed to the sale of the MH in the open market with the proceeds to be given to the Respondent Wife at 86% with 14% to the Appellant Husband.

34     The Court agreed with both Counsel that the weightage ratio should be 50:50 for DC vs IC. The Court also agreed with the Appellant Husband’s Counsel that the Respondent Wife’s DC should be 8.22% with 91.78% to the Appellant Husband. However, the Court agreed with the Respondent Wife’s Counsel that the Respondent Wife’s IC should be 70% with 30% to the Appellant Husband.

35     The Court noted that the Parties had agreed that they should retain all matrimonial assets (save for the MH) that were in their respective sole names without division thereof. The Court was of the view that as the Respondent Wife had been awarded care and control of the said 2 children and there was to be no division of the matrimonial assets (save for the MH), which was to the benefit of the Appellant Husband as the majority of the assets were in his name, that under Step 3 of the structured approach set out in _ANJ vs ANK_, an upward adjustment should be made in favour of the Respondent Wife.

36     Therefore, based on the Court’s calculations, the division of the MH was allotted to the Appellant Husband at 55% and Respondent Wife at 45% of the net proceeds. The details for this allotment are as follows:

37     The Court therefore ordered, based on this allotment, that the MH be sold in the open market within 6 months from the date of the said Court Order and that the Parties were to have joint conduct of the sale. Upon successful sale, the Parties’ allotted shares of the MH were to be in the apportioned shares of 55% to the Appellant Husband and 45% to the Respondent Wife of the net proceeds.

38     The Court also directed that the net proceeds referred to the balance amount after deducting the outstanding housing loan and all payments that may be due to the Housing Development Board as well as the costs and expenses related to the sale.

39     The Court further ordered that upon receipt of his/her share of the net proceeds, the Parties were to refund to his/her own CPF account, the monies which he/she utilized for the purchase of the MH, including accrued interests, in accordance with the CPF legislation and requirements.

40     Finally, the Court also considered the effect of such percentage division of the MH based on the figures provided by the Parties, to determine the value of each parties’ share after division. The Court’s calculations were that the apportionment to the Appellant Husband of 55% of the net proceeds, would be sufficient for the refund to the Appellant Husband’s CPF accounts of the monies which he had utilized for the purchase of the MH, including accrued interests.

41     However, in the event that there was any shortfall from the sale of the MH, the Court provided that the refunds to the Parties’ CPF accounts should be considered as partial refunds so that the Appellant Husband would not be required to make up the difference (see paragraph 28 of the said Court Order).
