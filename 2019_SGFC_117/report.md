Family law – Breach of Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules – Inherent jurisdiction - Restraining law firm and solicitor from acting for the Wife

4 November 2019

### District Judge Lo Wai Ping:

1       By way of summons, FC/SUM 2285/2019, the Plaintiff applied for the law firm representing the Defendant (the “**Law Firm**”) in the divorce proceedings commenced under FC/D 3281/2016 (“**Divorce Proceedings**”) to be enjoined from further acting for the Defendant in the proceedings (“**Restraining Application**”). The Plaintiff also applied for X, a solicitor with the Law Firm having conduct of the Divorce Proceedings (the “**Defendant Counsel**”) to be enjoined from further acting for the Defendant. After hearing the parties, I dismissed the Restraining Application. I set out below the reasons for my decision.

##### The Restraining Application

2       The thrust of the Plaintiff’s complaint under the Restraining Application was that the Defendant Counsel had filed an affidavit dated 8 May 2019 (“**DC Affidavit**”) in reply to the Plaintiff’s supporting affidavit filed on 26 April 2019 (“**Plaintiff’s Affidavit**”) for the Plaintiff’s application in summons FC/SUM 1428/2019 (“**SUM 1428**”).

3       SUM 1428 was the Plaintiff’s application that I be recused from any further hearing of the Divorce Proceedings (the “**Recusal Application**”). The Recusal Application was dismissed and there was no appeal by the Plaintiff against my dismissal of the Recusal Application. It should be noted that the Defendant did not file any affidavit for the Recusal Application.

4       The Plaintiff’s case was that by the Defendant Counsel’s act in filing the DC Affidavit, the Defendant Counsel had breached Rule 11(3) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (“**PCR**”) and accordingly both the Defendant Counsel and the Law Firm should be enjoined from further acting for the Defendant in the Divorce Proceedings. Rule 11(3) of the PCR is reproduced below:

> _“11(3_)     _In any case where it is known or it appears that a legal practitioner will be required to give evidence which is material to the determination of any contested issue before a court or tribunal —_

>> (_a_)     _the legal practitioner —_

>>> (_i_)     _must not accept instructions from any party to that case; and_

>>> (_ii_)    _must, if the legal practitioner was acting for any party to that case, discharge himself or herself, or, where the legal practitioner has represented that party in any proceedings relating to that case, apply to be discharged, from acting further for that party; but_

>> (_b_)     _the law practice in which the legal practitioner practises, or a member of that law practice, may represent or continue to represent any party to that case, unless doing so would prejudice the administration of justice.”_

5       In addition, the Plaintiff submitted that there were special or exceptional circumstances warranting the Court’s intervention and restraint of the Defendant Counsel and the Law Firm from further acting for the Defendant in the Divorce Proceedings.

6       At the outset, it should be noted that the Plaintiff was not a former client or a former prospective client of the Law Firm. It should also be noted that the basis relied upon by the Plaintiff for the Restraining Application did not involve any issue relating to breach of confidence or any potential disclosure of confidential information on the part of the Defendant Counsel or the Law Firm. There was also no allegation by the Plaintiff of any other breach of duty or any other breach of law by the Defendant Counsel, whether arising from the filing of the DC Affidavit or otherwise. The only alleged wrongful act of the Defendant Counsel in filing the DC Affidavit was the breach of Rule 11(3) of the PCR.

##### Alleged breach of PCR

7       In _Harsha Rajkumar Mirpuri (Mrs) née Subita Shewakram Samtani v Shanti Shewakram Samtani Mrs Shanti Haresh Chugani_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 155</span> (“**_Harsha’s Case_**”), a case concerning an application for an injunction to restrain a law firm from acting for a party to the proceedings due to the alleged breach of certain provisions of the PCR, the High Court stated the following:

> _“24_      _It is clear, therefore, that the court is not the proper forum for the determination of whether a given provision in the PCR has been breached, and that to apply the PCR in the injunctive context is effectively to invite the court to make or attempt to make such a determination, which is inappropriate. In my judgment, the PCR are a code of professional ethics which is enforced by a regulatory body, in this case, the Law Society, through disciplinary proceedings against legal practitioners in Singapore. The PCR are not, and were never intended to be, a set of rules governing when a private party might in civil proceedings obtain an injunction to restrain a law firm from acting for the opposing party.”_

8       In the present case, the Plaintiff was asking this court to enjoin the Defendant Counsel and the Law Firm from further acting for the Defendant in the Divorce Proceedings based on the alleged breach of Rule 11(3) of the PCR by the Defendant Counsel. In this regard, the Plaintiff was actually asking this court to make a determination that the Defendant Counsel, in filing the DC Affidavit, had breached Rule 11(3) of the PCR. As was pointed out by the High Court in _Harsha’s Case_ at paragraph \[24\], this was inappropriate as the court was not the proper forum for the determination and investigations of breaches of the PCR and “… _\[t\]he PCR are not, and were never intended to be, a set of rules governing when a private party might in civil proceedings obtain an injunction to restrain a law firm from acting for the opposing party_.”

##### Court’s inherent jurisdiction to supervise and regulate the conduct of its officers

9       I then considered the Plaintiff’s submission that there were special or exceptional circumstances in this case which warranted this court’s intervention and restraint of the Defendant Counsel and the Law Firm from continuing to act for the Defendant in the Divorce Proceedings. In support of his submission on this point, counsel for the Plaintiff referred to the High Court’s decision in _Then Khek Khoon and another v Arjun Permanand Samtani and another_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGHC 17</span> (“**_Then Khek Khoon_**”).

10     In _Then Khek Khoon_, the High Court had to deal with the issue whether it had inherent jurisdiction to hear an application by one defendant for an injunction to restrain the plaintiff’s solicitors from acting for the plaintiff based on alleged breaches of the PCR. The High Court stated that its inherent jurisdiction was very widely expressed in Order 92 rule 4 of the Rules of Court and that it had long been settled that Order 92 rule 4 of the Rules of Court included the _“jurisdiction to regulate and supervise the conduct of advocates and solicitors as officers of this court”_ (at \[13\]). But, it also cautioned that cases have however laid down that this inherent jurisdiction should only be invoked in “_exceptional circumstances where there is a clear need for it and the justice of the case so demands_” (_Then Khek Khoon_ at \[14\]).

11     I noted that in the subsequent _Harsha’s Case_, the High Court had also referred to this jurisdiction to regulate and supervise the conduct of its officers as an exercise of its inherent jurisdiction (see \[14\] of the judgment, though the term “supervisory jurisdiction” was adopted for the rest of the judgment to refer to the Court’s inherent jurisdiction). At \[73\] of _Harsha’s Case_, the High Court held that it had inherent jurisdiction to regulate the conduct of its officers which was distinct from its other jurisdictions.

12     It is clearly set out in section 5 of the Family Justice Act 2014 that a Family Court is a subordinate court. As the jurisdiction to regulate and supervise the conduct of its officers was held by the High Court in _Harsha’s Case_ and _Then Khek Khoon_ as an exercise of its inherent jurisdiction (the source of such jurisdiction being the High Court in its very nature as a superior court of law (see \[33\] – \[34\] of _Re Nalpon Zero Geraldo Mario_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGCA 28</span> and \[102\] of Li Shengwu v Attorney- General <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGCA 20</span>), a Family Court as a subordinate court does not have such inherent jurisdiction. This is so notwithstanding that Order 92 rule 4 of the Rules of Court is also found in Rule 958 of the Family Justice Rules.

13     However, even if I did (as a Family Court) have the requisite jurisdiction to grant the orders in the Restraining Application, I was of the view that the Plaintiff had not shown or established that there were any special or exceptional circumstances that would warrant the enjoinment of Law Firm and the Defendant Counsel from continuing to act for the Defendant in the Divorce Proceedings.

14     In _Harsha’s Case_, the High Court had this to say about the principles governing the court’s inherent jurisdiction over its officers:

> _“77_      _The applicable principles must naturally be derived from the purpose of the supervisory jurisdiction itself, which has already been alluded to. The central idea behind this jurisdiction is the court’s overriding duty to ensure the proper administration of justice, to protect the integrity of the legal process and to maintain public confidence in the rule of law. Within the justice system, lawyers play a critical role as officers of the court and as fiduciaries of their clients. For this reason, the proper discharge of their role is governed by the highest professional and ethical standards, embodied in the PCR, by which they may be held to account through disciplinary proceedings._ **_Exceptionally_**, _however, the conduct of a lawyer in a particular case_ **_may pose an immediate actual or perceived risk to the proper administration of justice_**, _whether in the particular case at hand or, even more exceptionally, at large. In such circumstances, it cannot be doubted that the Court has the duty, and correspondingly, the power, to purge that risk directly by restraining the lawyer from continuing to act.” (emphasis mine)_

15     Hence, although the court was not the proper forum for the investigation and determination of any alleged breaches of the PCR by a lawyer, it was recognised that in exceptional circumstances, the court may exercise its inherent jurisdiction to restrain a lawyer from continuing to act in a matter if the conduct of that lawyer may pose an immediate actual or perceived risk to the proper administration of justice.

16     As to the test to be applied by the court in determining whether it ought to exercise this inherent jurisdiction, at \[81\] to \[83\] of _Harsha’s Case_, the High Court stated this:

> _“81_      _…. In short_, **_the test is whether there is an actual or reasonably perceived risk that the proper administration of justice would be prejudiced unless the lawyer in question is removed. Whether the alleged risk is reasonably perceived must be assessed objectively through the eyes of the fair-minded observer. And the types of risk that the proper administration of justice would be prejudiced constitute a narrow and exceptional category_****.**

> _82_      **_Great care must be taken not to adopt an expansive view of this supervisory jurisdiction. This is for at least two reasons. First_**, _as Arden LJ observed in Geveran Trading (at \[43\])_, **_applications to remove an opposing party’s lawyer “can be used for purely tactical reasons and will inevitably cause inconvenience and delay in the proceedings_**_”._ **_Second_**_, as Lightman J pointed out In re A Firm of Solicitors (\[32\] supra at 9C–D)_, **_there is an interest in respecting the freedom of lawyers to obtain instructions from any member of the public and the freedom of all members of the public to instruct lawyers of their choice. Therefore, there must be a compelling reason for depriving both the client and the solicitor of their free election, a reason that demonstrates an actual or reasonably perceived risk to the proper administration of justice, before the Court will act to restrain a lawyer from acting under its supervisory jurisdiction._**

> _83_.     **_In this context, the question whether a given rule in the PCR has been breached or is at risk of being breached, in my view, may serve as an analytical tool for determining whether the supervisory jurisdiction ought to be involved._** _It has been seen that Loh J also contemplated this possibility in Then Khek Khoon: see \[78\] above. The rules in the PCR are ethical standards to which lawyers in this jurisdiction must hold themselves. Therefore, whether the lawyer in question appears to be in breach of a given rule in the PCR must be of some relevance in determining whether, in the eyes of a fair –minded observer, restraining him from acting is necessary to ensure the proper administration of justice. However, in applying the PCR this way, it is imperative for the court not to express any final opinion on whether any particular rule has been breached, as the proper forum for such a determination is the Law Society. …This approach is consistent with the general principle that the PCR are not the governing law in the injunctive context: see \[18\]-\[23\] above” (emphasis mine)_

17     In this case, the alleged offending conduct of the Defendant Counsel was that in filing the DC Affidavit, and in affirming the contents therein, the Defendant Counsel had given evidence in relation to the Recusal Application.

18     It should be noted that the contents of the Plaintiff’s Affidavit in the Recusal Application related to my management of the Divorce Proceedings including my refusal to interview the Plaintiff’s child (J) in the Plaintiff’s application for a personal protection order for J (“the **PPO Case**”) against J’s maternal uncle. As the Plaintiff’s appeal against my decision in the PPO Case was dismissed, the contents in the Plaintiff’s Affidavit and the DC Affidavit on this matter were matters that were already in the records of the court. Nothing in the two affidavits on the PPO Case related to the outstanding (contested) ancillary matters of the Divorce Proceedings.

19     Similarly, the Plaintiff’s allegations on my management of the Divorce Proceedings related to directions and orders (including the orders for discovery) that had been made by me prior to the filing of the Plaintiff’s Affidavit. These directions and orders made by me, the dates of such directions and orders and the circumstances that had given rise to such directions and orders were all matters entered in the court’s records. These contents, whether in the Plaintiff’s Affidavit or the DC Affidavit, were not matters that related to the outstanding (contested) ancillary matters of the Divorce Proceedings.

20     In the Plaintiff’s Affidavit, much was made of paragraph 20 in the DC Affidavit (“**Paragraph 20 Statement**”). The Plaintiff’s case was that the Defendant Counsel had alleged (in the Paragraph 20 Statement) that the Plaintiff had been in collusion with certain non-parties to conceal the true extent of his assets and means and as such, the Defendant Counsel would have to substantiate her allegations with evidence and the Plaintiff had a right to call her as a witness in the Divorce Proceedings. This was not a proper reading of the Paragraph 20 Statement. A proper reading of the Paragraph 20 Statement showed that this allegation was the Defendant’s allegation, which had been canvassed by the Defendant in her affidavits in the Divorce Proceedings.

21     Accordingly, the contents of the DC Affidavit were limited in scope and the DC Affidavit did not address any other issue relating to the outstanding (contested) ancillary matters of the Divorce Proceedings. Therefore, I did not agree that by filing the DC Affidavit, the Defendant Counsel had given any evidence which was material to the determination of any contested issue before this court. The DC Affidavit had merely set out events that had transpired in relation to the Divorce Proceedings, and only in relation to directions and orders that had been made by me, the details and circumstances all of which were within my personal knowledge and were matters that could be verified against the court’s records.

22     I must also point out that before the start of the hearing for the Recusal Application, I had informed the Plaintiff’s counsel that I would not be referring to the DC Affidavit for the reasons set out in the preceding paragraph. There was no necessity for me to refer to the DC Affidavit and indeed I did not refer to the DC Affidavit for the Recusal Application. All considered, I was therefore not persuaded that the Defendant Counsel would be a witness in the hearing of the outstanding (contested) ancillary matters.

23     As was highlighted earlier, the court will only intervene to restrain a lawyer from acting “_in special or exceptional circumstances_” where the court is of the view that the lawyer’s conduct may pose an “_actual or reasonably perceived risk that the proper administration of justice would be prejudiced_” unless the lawyer in question is removed. Whether the alleged risk is reasonably perceived must be assessed objectively through the eyes of a reasonable fair-minded observer.

24     In light of the reasons set out above, I was of the view that a reasonable fair minded observer viewing this whole matter objectively and having regard to the contents of the DC Affidavit, would not think that the rest of the Divorce Proceedings could not proceed fairly unless the Defendant Counsel and the Law Firm were restrained from further acting for the Defendant.

25     I agreed with the Defendant’s submission that there was no reason why the filing of the DC Affidavit would give rise to any immediate actual or reasonably perceived risk that the proper administration of justice would be prejudiced unless the Law Firm and the Defendant Counsel were restrained from representing the Defendant in the Divorce Proceedings.

26     I was also mindful of the High Court’s cautionary note in _Harsha’s Case_ that “\[g\]_reat care must be taken not to adopt an expansive view of this supervisory jurisdiction_” and the 2 reasons stated for that (see paragraph 16 above, _Harshe’s Case_ at \[82\]) and that the court should only invoke its inherent jurisdiction in exceptional circumstances where there is a clear need for it to prevent injustice or to prevent an abuse of process. I did not find that such exceptional circumstances were present in this case arising from the filing the DC Affidavit by the Defendant Counsel.

27     For all the above reasons, I therefore dismissed the Restraining Application with costs fixed at $2000.
