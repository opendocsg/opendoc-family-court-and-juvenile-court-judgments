Family law – Access

26 June 2020

### District Judge Guy Bte Ghazali:

## Introduction

1       This is an unfortunate case involving two parents who are embroiled in a relentless legal tussle involving their only child.

2       The child whom I will refer to as \[C\] will be turning 8 years old this year and is a Primary 2 student in a local primary school.

3       The Plaintiff-Mother (“Mother”) is a 31-year-old Chinese national and a Singapore Permanent Resident. The Defendant-Father is a 57-year-old Singaporean who is residing in Johor Bahru, Malaysia.

## Related applications and orders

4       The present application is the Mother’s application for, among other things, suspension of access. In dealing with the present application, it is necessary to understand the background and history of the related applications and orders relating to the parties.

5       At all material times, the Father acted in person while the Mother was represented by solicitors. As different firms of solicitors represented the Mother at different times, I will refer to them as the Mother’s 1st solicitors, the Mother’s 2nd solicitors and the Mother’s 3rd solicitors.

## (i)   Order of Court dated 8 August 2017 (By consent)

6       On 8 August 2017, the parties entered into a consent order on, among other things, the issues of custody, care and control and access. The parties entered into the said consent order after mediation. At this time, the Mother was represented by her 1st solicitors.

7       The relevant parts of the Order of Court dated 8 August 2017 are reproduced below.

> _“(a_)     _Parties to have joint custody of the child of the marriage, namely \[C\] (BC No. \[redacted\]) (“the child”) with care and control to the \[Mother\]._

> (_b_)     _The \[Father\] to have access as follows:_

>> (_i_)     _From now till 31 March 2018, weekly access on Saturday from 11.00 am to 8.00 pm._

>> (_ii_)    _With effect from 1 April 2018, alternate weekend access from Friday 7.00 pm to Sunday 8.00 pm, commencing on Friday 6 April 2018._

>> (_iii_)    _In 2018 and even-numbered years thereafter, from the eve of Chinese New Year (CNY) 7.00 pm to the first day of CNY 7.00 pm. In 2019 and odd-numbered years thereafter, on the eve of CNY from 12.00 pm to 7.00 pm and the second day of CNY from 11.00 am to 8.00 pm._

>> (_iv_)    _In 2018 and even-numbered years thereafter, New Year’s Day and Christmas Day from 11.00 am to 8.00 pm._

>> (_v_)     _In 2019 and odd-numbered years thereafter, the first half of the June and November/December school holidays. In 2020 and even-numbered years thereafter, the second half of the June and November/December school holidays. In 2019 and thereafter, 3 days during the March and September school holidays._

>> (_vi_)    _The \[Father\] to fetch and send the child to a location to be agreed by parties._

>> (_vii_)   _Parties are at liberty to bring the child out of jurisdiction by providing the other party the destination, travel arrangement, itinerary and overseas contact details at least 1 week in advance prior to departure._

>> (_viii_)   _The \[Mother\] to give the child’s passport to the \[Father\] at least 2 days prior to departure. The \[Father\] to return the child’s passport to the \[Mother\] within 2 days upon return to Singapore.”_

8       Additionally, the Order of Court dated 8 August 2017 also clarified that paragraphs 3(b) and 3(c) of the Order of Court dated 10 July 2017 were to remain until further orders.

9       For completeness, paragraphs 3(b) and 3(c) of the Order of Court dated 10 July 2017 are reproduced below. The Order of Court dated 10 July 2017 was also entered into by the consent of the parties after mediation.

> _“b_.     _Pending final orders on ancillary matters of FC/D 5793/2016 with regards (sic) to the child’s arrangements, the \[Mother\] shall hand over the child’s birth certificate and the \[Father\] shall hand over the child’s passport to the \[Mother’s\] solicitors for safekeeping by 12 July 2017. The documents shall not be released to either party without the parties' consent or court order._

> _c_.     _The \[Father\] shall have liberty to inspect the child’s birth certificate and passport at the \[Mother’s\] solicitors’ office by giving 1 working day notice either by text message or email. The inspection shall be done during the \[Mother’s\] solicitors’ office hours, Monday to Friday from 9.00 am to 6.00 pm.”_

## (ii)   Ancillary Matters Order dated 12 January 2018 (“Ancillary Matters Order”)

10     At the ancillary matters hearing, the issues of custody, care and control and access did not require determination by the Court as the parties had already agreed on these issues under the Order of Court dated 8 August 2017. However, as the Mother’s 1st solicitors were in physical possession of the child’s birth certificate and passport, the Court ordered for the release of these documents to the Mother as the care and control parent. Save as aforesaid, the Order of Court dated 8 August 2017 continued to stand in respect of \[C\].

11     In the interest of completeness, I would add that the Mother filed an appeal against the Ancillary Matters Order, specifically in respect of the orders pertaining to the division of matrimonial assets and wife’s maintenance. However, the Mother’s appeal was dismissed.

12     Final Judgment was granted on 5 February 2018.

## (iii)   The Father’s attempts to seek a committal order against the Mother for the Mother’s breach of the access orders

13     For the period from 25 September 2018 until 4 January 2019, the Father filed three different applications that purportedly seek to commence committal proceedings against the Mother for breach of access to the child.

14     These applications were taken out on the basis that the Mother had allegedly stopped access from July 2018 onwards. The Father also alleged that between February 2018 and July 2018, the Mother had provided the Father with irregular and intermittent access to the child.

15     However, these applications were either withdrawn or dismissed as they were not in compliance with the rules.

16     The Father eventually succeeded in obtaining leave to commence an application for a committal order against the Mother and subsequently, a committal order against the Mother on 30 May 2019.

## (iv)   FC/SUM 132/2019 - The Father’s application for variation of the orders relating to the child

17     The Father also applied for variation of the orders relating to the child. At the time this application was heard on 15 March 2019, the Father had not seen the child since July 2018. He did not know the whereabouts of the child – whether the child was in Singapore or had been brought back to the Mother’s home country. He did not know where the child was residing or studying at (although based on the child’s age, she would have been in Primary 1). According to the Father, he was not informed of the child’s enrolment into Primary 1 and his consent was not sought for.

18     Even though the Mother was properly served with the summons, she did not appear at the abovementioned hearing. At the said hearing on 15 March 2019 and after considering the merits of the Father’s application, the Court made the following orders:

> “1)      _Paragraph 1(c) of the Order of Court dated 8 August 2017 read with paragraph 8 of the Order of Court dated 12 January 2018 shall be varied to the extent that insofar as the \[Mother\] is concerned:_

>> (i)        _The \[Mother\] shall not by herself, her agents or her servants, bring the child of the marriage, \[C\] (BC No. \[redacted\]), out of Singapore without the prior written consent of the \[Father\] or an Order of Court._

> 2)      _Paragraph 1(e) of the Order of Court dated 8 August 2017 read with paragraph 8 of the Order of Court dated 12 January 2018 shall be varied as follows:_

> _With effect from April 2018, the \[Father\] shall pay the \[Mother\] $400 per month as maintenance for the child. Payment shall be made in two instalments of $200 each on the 15th and the last day of each month. Payment shall be made into the \[Mother's\] POSB bank account number \[redacted\]._

> 3)      _Paragraph 8 of the Order of Court dated 12 January 2018 shall be varied to include the following additional subsection:_

> _Further to the joint custody order, the \[Mother\] shall provide the \[Father\] with details of the child's residence and the child's school within 3 days' of service of this order. In the event of any change, the \[Mother\] shall notify the \[Father\] of such change within three days of knowledge of the change._

> 4)      _Save as set out above, the other orders in the Order of Court dated 8 August 2017 and the Order of Court dated 12 January 2018 shall remain._

> 5)      _The \[Mother\] shall reimburse the \[Mother\] for the filing fees and oath fees incurred in filing this Summons.”_

## (v)   The Mother’s non-attendance in Court despite knowledge of the proceedings

19     I will briefly address the Mother’s non-attendance in Court despite her knowledge of ongoing proceedings.

20     One of the applications that the Father had taken out in \[13\] above is FC/SUM 3402/2018, which was filed as a variation summons but contained a prayer relating to breach of access.

21     On 12 November 2018, the Father obtained an order to serve the summons on the Mother by substituted service at the Mother’s email address.

22     On 13 November 2018, a Registrar’s Notice was sent to the Mother informing the Mother of the next case conference on 26 November 2018.

23     On 15 November 2018, the Mother wrote to the Court from her email address (i.e. the same email address set out in the substituted service order) stating that _“the \[Father\] has yet to effect proper and good service of his summons and affidavit in support in FC/SUM 3402/2018”_ and _“save for the \[Father\] doing the same, \[she was\] not obliged to attend court, including the case conference on 26 November 2018”_.

24     Based on the affidavit of service that was filed by the Father, FC/SUM 3402/2018 was served on the Mother at the Mother’s email address on 16 November 2018.

25     However, the Mother was absent at the case conference on 26 November 2018.

26     At the abovementioned case conference, the Court fixed a hearing date for FC/SUM 3402/2018.

27     Thereafter, on 28 November 2018, a Registrar’s Notice was sent to the Mother informing the Mother of the hearing date. The said Registrar’s Notice contained, among other things, the following notice:

> _“Do note that the court may make further directions or orders in this matter at the aforementioned hearing, as it deems appropriate, even in the absence of one party.”_

28     Notwithstanding the above notice, the Mother was absent at the hearing of FC/SUM 3402/2018. Unrelated to the Mother’s non-attendance at the hearing, the Father withdrew FC/SUM 3402/2018 at the said hearing.

29     On 11 January 2019, the Father filed a fresh summons for variation (see \[17\] above).

30     The Father obtained another substituted service order on 15 January 2019. Based on the affidavit of service that was filed by the Father, the summons was served by the Father on the Mother at the Mother’s email address on 12 February 2019.

31     After the Father filed the affidavit of service, a Registrar’s Notice was sent to the Mother on 25 February 2019, informing the Mother of the next case conference on 25 February 2019. The said Registrar’s Notice contained, among other things, the following notice:

> _“If you fail to attend court on the date and time provided, please note that the court may proceed to deal with the matter in your absence including making any appropriate directions or orders in FC/SUM 132/2019.”_

32     The Mother was once again absent at the case conference on 25 February 2019.

33     At the case conference on 25 February 2019, a hearing date was given.

34     On 26 February 2019, a Registrar’s Notice was sent to the Mother informing her of the hearing that was scheduled for 15 March 2019. The said Registrar’s Notice contained, among other things, the following notice:

> _“Please be further notified that if you are absent in court on the date and time provided, the court may proceed to deal with the matter in your absence and make orders (including cost-related orders) in FC/SUM 132/2019.”_

35     For the fourth time, the Mother was absent from Court at the hearing on 15 March 2019 at which the orders at \[18\] were made in her absence.

## (vi)   Applications and appeals filed by the Mother after the Order of Court dated 15 March 2019

36     It is important for this Court to highlight the Mother’s contrasting approaches towards court proceedings before and after the Order of Court dated 15 March 2019 was made. As set out above, before the Order of Court dated 15 March 2019 was made, the Mother was repeatedly absent from Court despite her knowledge of court proceedings. However, this changed after the Order of Court dated 15 March 2019.

37     To recap, the Order of Court dated 15 March 2019, among other things, restrains the Mother from bringing \[C\] out of Singapore without the prior written consent of the Father or an order of court.

##### (a)    FC/SUM 1444/2019

38     After the making of the Order of Court dated 15 March 2019, the Mother finally appeared in court proceedings by way of her application in FC/SUM 1444/2019 for an order that she be allowed to take the child for a holiday in Batam, Indonesia from 3 to 5 May 2019. The application was filed on 30 April 2019. At this time, the Mother was represented by her 2nd solicitors.

39     The Mother’s application raised a few concerns. First, it was filed as an _ex parte_ application even though an application of such nature ought to be filed as an _inter partes_ application. Secondly, on the same day when the application was filed, the Mother’s 2nd solicitors attended before the Duty Judge to seek an urgent order of the Mother’s application without notifying the Father of the solicitors’ attendance in Court or serving the application on the Father. The Mother’s application for an urgent order was not allowed by the Duty Judge and the Mother was directed to serve the application on the Father. A case conference date was also fixed.

40     Incidentally, the Father had a pending application, seeking a committal order against the Mother, in FC/SUM 1180/2019, which had been served on the Mother a week earlier on 26 April 2019. By this time, the Father had successfully obtained an order for leave to commence committal proceedings against the Mother after three previous unsuccessful attempts. The Mother’s application was fixed for case conference together with the Father’s application.

41     However, when the Mother’s 2nd solicitors attended at the case conference on 3 May 2019, the Mother’s 2nd solicitors informed the Court that they were appearing on behalf of the Mother only for the Mother’s application but not for the Father’s application. The Mother’s 2nd solicitors eventually conceded that they were appearing on behalf of the Mother for both applications when it was highlighted to them that they had filed their Notice of Appointment in the divorce suit in which both applications were filed.

42     For completeness, the Mother’s application in FC/SUM 1444/2019 was dismissed as the Mother did not, among other things, provide the necessary notice to the Father and the information required under paragraph 1(c) of the Order of Court dated 8 August 2017.

##### (b)    FC/SUM 1600/2019

43     On 13 May 2019, the Mother filed a further application to take the child out of Singapore from 5 June 2019 to 8 June 2019. By this time, the Mother was already represented by her 3rd solicitors.

44     The Mother’s application was allowed after the Mother agreed to provide the Father with a contact number on which he could contact the child during this period and on the Mother’s solicitors’ undertaking that they would inform the Father of the child’s return to Singapore.

##### (c)    FC/SUM 1631/2019

45     FC/SUM 1631/2019 is the Mother’s application to set aside the Order of Court dated 15 March 2019.

46     The Mother’s application was dismissed as the Court was satisfied that the Mother had notice of the application that led to the Order of Court dated 15 March 2019. On the evidence, the Court found that the Mother’s absence from Court was deliberate and calculated and that the Mother had demonstrated no intention of participating in the proceedings until the Order of Court dated 15 March 2019 was made. As the Order of Court dated 15 March 2019 prevented the Mother from bringing the child out of Singapore without the Father’s prior written consent or an order of court, the Mother was left with no choice but to participate in the ongoing proceedings. Additionally, the Court did not find any factor that leaned in the Mother’s favour and instead found that a setting aside of the Order of Court dated 15 March 2019 would be prejudicial to the Father as the Mother had demonstrated a pattern of being absent from the Court (the Mother’s non-attendance in Court has been addressed at \[19\] to \[35\] above).

47     Dissatisfied with the outcome, the Mother appealed against the dismissal order. However, the Mother’s appeal was dismissed by the High Court.

##### (d)    Mother’s appeal against the committal order

48     As set out at \[16\], the Father obtained a committal order against the Mother for her breach of the access orders. Under the committal order, the Mother was fined $800 and in default of payment, the Mother was to serve two days’ imprisonment. The Mother paid the fine in accordance with the committal order.

49     Notwithstanding that the Mother complied with the committal order, the Mother proceeded to file an appeal against the committal order. The Mother’s appeal was dismissed by the High Court.

## The present Summons

50     I now address the present Summons.

51     This is an application by the Mother for variation of the Order of Court dated 8 August 2017 and the Order of Court dated 15 March 2019.

52     The prayers sought by the Mother in the present application are reproduced below:

> _“1_.     _Clauses 1(b)(i) to (vi) of the Order of Court dated 8 August 2017 to be varied as follows:_

>> _The \[Father\] shall have no access to the child of the marriage pending the conclusion of the investigations by the Singapore Police Force (“the SPF") and the Ministry of Social and Family Development (“the MSF") / Child Protective Services (“the CPS") in relation to police report no. \[xxx\]._

> _2_.     _Clause 1(c) of the Order of Court dated 8 August 2017 to be varied as follows:_

>> _The \[Mother\] is at liberty to bring the child out of jurisdiction by providing the \[Father\] with the destination, travel arrangement, itinerary and overseas contact details at least one week in advance prior to departure. For the avoidance of doubt, the \[Father\] shall not bring the child out of jurisdiction pending the conclusion of the investigations by the SPF and the MSF/CPS in relation to police report no. \[xxx\]._

> _3_.     _Clause 1(d) of the Order of Court dated 8 August 2017 to be varied as follows:_

>> _The \[Mother\] shall be at liberty to withhold the child's passport and shall not provide the same to the \[Father\] for the purposes of any travel pending the conclusion of the investigations by the SPF and the MSF/CPS in relation to police report no. \[xxx\]._

> _4_.     _In the event that the Order of Court dated 15 March 2019 is not set aside in FC/SUM 1631/2019, Clause 1(3) of the Order of Court dated 15 March 2019 to be varied as follows:_

>> _The \[Mother\] shall be at liberty to withhold from the \[Father\] details of the child's residence and the child's school pending the conclusion of the investigations by the SPF and the MSF/the CPS in relation to police report no. \[xxx\]._

> _5_.     _Costs._

> _6_.     _Such other orders that this Honourable Court deems fit.”_

53     The Mother’s application is premised on the police report that she lodged on 25 April 2019. The police report was surfaced for the first time in the Mother’s affidavit dated 30 April 2019 in support of her application for leave to take the child for a holiday to Batam. In the said affidavit, it was the Mother’s position that after the last access session in July 2018, the child complained that the Father had behaved in “a sexually inappropriate way”. The Mother alleged that the Father had masturbated in the car in the presence of the child. According to the Mother, when this happened, the child was in the back passenger seat while the Father was in the driver’s seat.

54     In a subsequent affidavit dated 13 May 2019, the Mother also informed the Court that she had lodged a case with the CPS.

55     In light of the severity of the Mother’s allegations and to assist in my determination, I ordered for an Access Evaluation Report (“AER”) on 9 July 2019.

56     However, the Mother was unhappy that an AER was directed. The Mother appealed against my direction for AER. However, the Mother’s appeal was dismissed.

57     Although the Mother’s appeal was dismissed, the time taken for the preparation of the AER was impacted by the appeal and there was a delay in the conclusion of the AER. The Court was in receipt of the AER in March 2020.

58     I will address the Mother’s prayers in the present Summons in turn.

59     Prayer 1 of the Mother’s Summons prays for a variation of paragraph 1(b) of the Order of Court dated 8 August 2017. Paragraph 1(b) relates to the terms of the Father’s access to the child as agreed between the parties. Under prayer 1, the Mother is seeking an order that the Father shall have no access to the child pending the conclusion of the investigations by the SPF and the CPS.

60     Prayer 2 of the Mother’s Summons prays for a variation of paragraph 1(c) of the Order of Court dated 8 August 2017. The said paragraph 1(c) reads: _“Parties are at liberty to bring the child out of jurisdiction by providing the other party the destination, travel arrangement, itinerary and overseas contact details at least 1 week in advance prior to departure”_. Under prayer 2, the Mother is seeking a variation of this order such that the Father shall not bring the child out of jurisdiction pending the conclusion of the investigations by the SPF and the CPS. By way of comment, it should be noted that paragraph 1(c) of the Order of Court dated 8 August 2017 must be read with paragraph 1(1) of the Order of Court dated 15 March 2019, which stipulates as follows: _“Paragraph 1(c) of the Order of Court dated 8 August 2017 read with paragraph 8 of the Order of Court dated 12 January 2018 shall be varied to the extent that insofar as the \[Mother\] is concerned: (i) The \[Mother\] shall not by herself, her agents or her servants, bring the child of the marriage, \[C\] (BC No. xxx), out of Singapore without the prior written consent of the \[Father\] or an Order of Court”_.

61     Prayer 3 of the Mother’s Summons prays for a variation of paragraph 1(d) of the Order of Court dated 8 August 2017. The said paragraph 1(d) stipulates as follows: _“The \[Mother\] to give the child’s passport to the \[Father\] at least 2 days prior to departure. The \[Father\] to return the child’s passport to the \[Mother\] within 2 days upon return to Singapore”_. Under prayer 3, the Mother is seeking an order for the child’s passport to be withheld from the Father for purposes of any travel pending the conclusion of the investigations by the SPF and the CPS.

62     Prayer 4 of the Mother’s Summons prays for a variation of paragraph 1(3) of the Order of Court dated 15 March 2019, which provides: _“Paragraph 8 of the Order of Court dated 12 January 2018 shall be varied to include the following additional subsection: Further to the joint custody order, the \[Mother\] shall provide the \[Father\] with details of the child's residence and the child's school within 3 days of service of this order. In the event of any change, the \[Mother\] shall notify the \[Father\] of such change within three days of knowledge of the change.”_ By prayer 4, the Mother is seeking an order for the details on the child’s residence and school to be withhheld from the Father pending the outcome of the investigations by the SPF and the CPS.

63     A common proviso in the Mother’s prayers, as expressly stated in the Mother’s Summons, is that these orders are sought pending the outcome of the investigations by the SPF and the CPS.

64     However, based on the Pre-Screening AER, it is noted that the CPS did not take up the case for investigation and the case was closed on 23 May 2019. In this regard, it is noted that the present Summons was filed on 7 June 2019, about two weeks after 23 May 2019.

65     As for the police investigations, I note from the AER that by 4 February 2020, the police have concluded their investigations. The police have “decided not to take further action” against the Father and have closed the case.

66     For the above reasons alone, the Mother’s application can no longer stand as the orders sought by the Mother are on the basis that there are ongoing investigations by the SPF and/or the CPS. As at the date of my orders, these investigations have concluded and the Court has been made aware of the outcome of these investigations.

67     I also have the benefit of the AER that has been prepared and submitted to the Court. Having considered the AER, I draw the following conclusions:

> a)     The Father and the child had a healthy relationship before the Mother stopped access in July 2018.

> b)     Although access had ceased since July 2018, the child continued to view the Father positively. There is hope for the Father-child relationship to continue to grow. If the Father’s access to the child is obstructed, the Father-child relationship may deteriorate over time, possibly beyond repair, and this will be adverse to the child’s welfare.

> c)     The Mother has demonstrated a consistent pattern of gatekeeping. Quite apart from not wanting access between the Father and the child to take place, the Mother does not wish to divulge information relating to the child to the Father such as the child’s residence or school.

> d)     Most signficantly, despite the Mother’s allegation that the Father has behaved inappropriately in front of the child, which does not appear to have been borne out in the evidence and/or from the AER, there is no safety issue or risk in the Father having access to the child. In fact, access to the Father will be beneficial to the child.

68     Having considered the evidence in this matter, the AER and the outcome of both the police and CPS investigations, I find that the Mother’s allegation that the Father has behaved inappropriately in the presence of the child unsubstantiated. In addition to these, I also note that the police report was only lodged by the Mother on 25 April 2019, more than nine months after the alleged incident complained of. As stated above, during the period between July 2018 and April 2019, the Father has filed numerous applications in Court including applications in relation to the Mother’s breach of access. At no time did the Mother raise the issue of the Father’s alleged inappropriate behaviour. It would appear that the timing of the police report coincided with the period after the Father had obtained the Order of Court dated 15 March 2019 from the Court, preventing the Mother from taking the child out of Singapore without the Father’s prior written consent or an order of court.

69     In the circumstances, I have dismissed the Mother’s present application for suspension of the access orders. I do however note that even though the Mother’s application is dismissed, in reality, the Father has not had access to the child since July 2018. As at the time of my orders, there has been no access for a period of 1 year and 8 months. Although police investigations have concluded, the Mother has not reinstated access.

70     The Mother’s conduct is indicative of a parent who is resolute in preventing access. Needless to say, such conduct is not in the best interests of the child.

71     When determining applications relating to a child, the Court directs its mind to the paramount consideration of the welfare of the child. If, on the facts and evidence, access to a parent, whether unsupervised or otherwise, is incompatible to the welfare of the child, the Court will not hesitate to incorporate such safeguards as may be necessary to protect the welfare of the child. However, where no such concern or risk exists, and access is not adverse to the child but instead beneficial to the child, the Court must encourage access and will frown upon acts that are intended to inhibit a parent-child relationship.

72     As the Mother’s present Summons has been dismissed, the existing access orders shall continue to stand. However, I am cognisant that there has been no access for a signficant period of time. To facilitate the resumption of access under the existing access orders, I have ordered for the Father to have supervised visitation at the Divorce Support Specialist Agency (“DSSA”) for eight sessions and for the parties and the child to attend counselling at the DSSA. This order for supervised visitation is without prejudice to and does not affect the existing access orders. It is meant to supplement and facilitate the existing orders. However, the Court has since been informed by the DSSA that the Mother has expressed a reluctance to continue with the supervised visitation pending the outcome of her appeal against my present orders.

73     In summary, my orders are as follows:

> i.     Prayers 1 to 4 of the Mother’s Summons are dismissed.

> ii.     The Father shall have supervised access with the child at the DSSA (under the DSSA supervised visitation programme) once a week for eight (8) sessions. Parties may be required to attend any other programme including counselling, as determined by the DSSA. An access review hearing may be fixed by the court after a report has been submitted by the DSSA to the court.

> iii.     The parties and the child shall attend counselling at the DSSA.

> iv.     For the avoidance of doubt, the above orders are without prejudice to and do not affect the Orders of Court dated 8 August 2017, 12 January 2018 and 15 March 2019 in respect of the child.

## Issues relating to the child’s enrolment into primary school

74     Finally, I would highlight an incidental point. In the Mother’s affidavit dated 1 July 2019 filed in this application, the Mother stated that the child was enrolled into a local primary school. The registration was in 2018 for Primary 1 placement in 2019.

75     As there was a joint custody order and it was the Father’s position that he did not know about the enrolment and did not sign any document consenting to the enrolment, the Court had directed for the Mother to file a further affidavit stating whether she provided the child’s school with the Letter of Consent containing the Father’s consent (which is a document required for divorced parents for Primary 1 registration) and if she did not do so, to state the reasons for the same.

76     In the Mother’s further affidavit, it was the Mother’s position that she had discussed with the Father about the choice of the child’s school but she disagreed with the Father’s choice. As there was no agreement, she had informed the Father that she would be enrolling the child in a different school of her choice. As she did not have the Father’s consent, she provided a letter of undertaking to the school. According to the Mother, pursuant to the letter of undertaking, the child could be taken out of school or transferred to another school if it subsequently transpired that the Father did not consent to the enrolment.

77     Pursuant to the joint custody, both parties have the the joint authority to make decisions for the child, including the choice of the child’s primary school. Notwithstanding the joint custody order, it turned out that the Mother had proceeded to register the child in the school of her choice without notifying the Father or taking steps to procure the Father’s consent.

78     According to the Mother, the Mother had signed a letter of undertaking to the school. However, the Mother did not exhibit any documents showing the circumstances behind the signing of the letter of undertaking, including her communications with the school or the reasons that she had furnished to the school leading to the letter of undertaking.

79     The Mother also did not seek a court order to allow her to be the sole decision maker in this regard. Instead, the Mother made a unilateral decision, contrary to the letter and spirit of the joint custody order, which was an order made pursuant to her agreement and consent.

80     It is also evident that the Father did not have information on the child’s residential address or school. The Father had to take steps to obtain the Order of Court dated 15 March 2019 to compel the Mother to disclose such information. It is noted that even though the Mother was required to provide the information within 3 days from the service of the Order of Court dated 15 March 2019, this order has not been complied with. Instead, the Mother filed the present application to withhold such information from the Father.

81     The fact that the Mother has applied to withhold information on the child’s residence and school belies her position that she has taken on affidavit that she did not have the Father’s consent to enrol the child into the school of her choice, suggesting that the Father was aware of the identity of the school of her choice but did not agree to the same. The Mother made no attempt to seek the Father’s consent as she had wanted to hide the details of the child’s school (in addition to the child’s residential address) from the Father.

82     The Mother is urged to comply with her obligations under the existing court orders and to understand that whilst she may be driven by her unwavering desire to do what she perceives to be the best for her child, her acts may be detrimental to the welfare of her child in the long run. In particular, her child will be deprived of one of the most fundamental relationships in life, which is that between a child and her father.
