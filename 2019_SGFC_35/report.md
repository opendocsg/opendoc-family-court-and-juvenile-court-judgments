“division of matrimonial property”, “maintenance for the wife”

15 March 2019

### District Judge Lim Keng Yeow:

## Introduction

#### Introduction

1       This is an appeal by the Defendant Wife (“the Wife”) against all of the ancillary orders which I made in respect of the ancillary matters between the parties.

2       The Plaintiff Husband (hereafter “the Husband”), aged 55 and the Wife, aged 54 got married on xxx 2001. Interim judgment was granted on 31 August 2017 on the parties’ cross-claims. The marriage lasted 16 years. They had no children together. In relation to the ancillary matters, the orders that were sought related only to two areas: (a) division of matrimonial assets, and (b) maintenance for the Defendant.

3       I will address the division of matrimonial assets first. Both parties accepted that the structured approach as set out in _ANJ v ANK_ \[2015\] SGCA 1043 was applicable, and I determined the division on that basis.

#### Pool of matrimonial assets

4       The pool of matrimonial assets must first be identified. The items in the pool and their net value were largely agreed to by the parties. The Wife additionally claimed to be under two loans, but it was disputed by the Husband. I found that it was a bare assertion unsubstantiated by documentary evidence and rejected it.

5       The Wife also claimed that assets of xxx Trading (a sole proprietorship operated by the Husband) amounted to $90,257.29 and that this sum should form part of the matrimonial pool. The Wife based this figure on the business’ Balance Sheet as at 31 December 2016 (the Husband’s 1st Affidavit of Assets and Means, page 419). I formed the view that the document was insufficient to enable me to ascribe an estimated value of the assets, and declined to include the value of the assets to the overall pool (at the time of writing these Grounds, however, I came to accept that an estimated value should be ascribed. I revisit this issue and its implications at the end of these Grounds).

6       Accordingly, I found that the pool was as follows:

#### Direct Financial Contributions

7       I turn to address the parties’ respective direct financial contributions to the Executive Condominium (“the EC”) and joint account monies.

8       In determining their individual contributions, the issue of the Wife’s involvement and contribution to the Husband’s business had to be dealt with first. That was because the Wife claimed to have made very substantial contributions to it for 11 years whilst receiving only a minimal salary disproportionate to her contributions. She contended that, as a result, whatever the Husband did pay out of the funds of the business could not be regarded as merely his own contribution. A significant part of his payments should be attributed to her as her contribution.

9       Hence, I had to first make a finding as to the true extent of the Wife’s involvement in and contribution to the business. If her role was indeed so significant that her contribution to the business was equal to the Husband’s and was not duly remunerated, there would be good grounds to accord her a proportionate share of the payments made out of the business profits. If, however, her contribution was not significant and she did receive due payment, it was sufficient to recognise her participation as part of her indirect contributions to the marriage by providing the Husband some support in his business.

10     Both parties’ accounts as to the nature and true extent of the Wife’s contribution stood in sharp conflict and were nearly impossible to reconcile. The Wife’s claims in relation to her work at the Husband’s business were as follows:

(a)     She closed her business in 2002 to help in the Husband’s business at his request;

(b)     She advised the Husband to rent cold storage space at xxx Chin Bee Drive. She cleaned and tidied that place, accepted deliveries and managed the stock;

(c)     She drove the lorry to make deliveries. She met customers and collected orders and payments. She also did some administrative work at the office;

(d)     When business improved, she advised the Husband to hire more staff. She also put up advertisements to recruit the staff.

(e)     She would buy breakfast for the staff at around 7am, work from about 9:15am until lunchtime, end work at about 3pm, and visit customers to collect payment from 8pm until 1am and thereafter. Twice a week, she did voluntary work for dogs between 1pm and 3 pm;

(f)     She was treated very badly by the Husband at the workplace, constantly suffering verbal abuse by him. In one incident, she was molested by drunks when attending at a customer’s premises to collect payment. She complained to the Husband, only to be scolded by him and told to get the payment collected;

(g)     She was paid a “small salary”, not the monthly $3,000 as claimed by the Husband. She did receive CPF payments, though not for the entire duration claimed by the Husband, and

(h)     Around March or April 2013, the Husband hired an “office girl” who occupied the Wife’s seat. Three days later, the Husband terminated her in a humiliating manner.

11     The Husband countered as follows:

(a)     Seeing that the Wife was economically unproductive and seemed to be doing nothing all day, he asked her to join his business as an employee in 2004;

(b)     The Wife was a bad employee. She would go into the office later than she was to. She was tasked essentially to issue invoices, which was simple did not take much time. Despite that, she was prone to making clerical mistakes which cost the business money, and the Husband had to check through what she did. She did not make effort to exercise more care, saying that he was going to go through the invoices again anyway;

(c)     The Wife did not make deliveries. She would collect debts as and when it was convenient for her;

(d)     In the course of her work, she spent very much time volunteering at a dog shelter on a regular basis. Against the Husband’s wishes, she would leave the office after lunch to do so on a daily basis;

(e)     In 2012, the Husband came to believe that the Wife had stolen some $165,000 from the firm. He stayed in the office until 3.30am to verify the numbers. When he confronted the Wife about this, the Wife contended that he should hire someone else and she did not come back to work for 21 days without giving notice;

(f)     The Husband paid the Wife $3,000 per month for her work. He also paid her CPF, and produced statements from 2012 that showed this.

12     In the face of the two diametrically-opposed accounts, I examined the _undisputed facts_ to see whose version of the facts they leaned in support of. They included the following:

(a)     The Wife was dismissed, terminated or otherwise removed from the business by the Husband. There was no suggestion by the Wife that her role in and contributions to the business were such that she was _ever_ in the position to dismiss the Husband. On the totality of the evidence, this was utterly unimaginable. Clearly, it was the Husband who was in the position to dismiss her, and not the other way round. This did not support her suggestions that she played a pivotal role in the business as much as the Husband did (at least, not throughout the 11 years) and it supported the Husband’s assertions that her contribution was much less significant than she claimed.

(b)     The Wife would be absent from the workplace for several hours in the afternoons on a regular basis. She was able to spend hours doing voluntary work for dogs in the course of the ordinary work-day, and in fact did so very frequently. The fact that she could and would do so showed that the business was not dependent on what she brought to it, and certainly did not suggest that her contribution to the business was substantial. I found that this generally supported the Husband’s account more than hers.

(c)     The Wife got her son (from her previous marriage) to work at the business after he completed his National Service. This cast doubt on her assertions that despite all her contributions, she was hardly paid anything by the Husband. If that were true, it would have made no sense for her to bring her son in and give support to him working there. It is also common ground that the Wife did work at the business for many years. If all her allegations were true, why would she have subjected herself to that much and for that long? After all, she said she had other options available to her. Furthermore, bringing her son in did not strengthen her suggestions that throughout her tenure there, she was badly mistreated by the Husband and had to suffer incessant verbal abuse by him.

(d)     The Wife did not dispute evidence adduced by the Husband as to CPF payments made to her. They did not support the Wife’s assertion of being paid a meagre salary disproportionate to her sizeable contributions. Evidence of monthly payments of some $605 gave support to the Husband’s version that she was paid about $3,000, at least around 2012.

13     I found that the undisputed facts gave support to the Husband’s version rather than the Wife’s. In fact, I was unable to find undisputed facts which leaned in favour of the Wife’s account and cast doubt on the Husband’s. My assessment of the evidence on the whole, was that the Wife may indeed have made the contributions she listed, but that was only in the early days and was not sustained over the years. It is unclear how long that may have been, but my assessment is that the amount of time she accorded to the business dropped after that initial period and her contributions declined significantly.

14     On a balance of probabilities, I found that her overall contribution was far from what she had claimed and that she was duly paid for the work she performed. Seeing that she would have received benefits proportionate to her contributions, there was therefore no basis for me to go beyond that to attribute half or even any significant proportion of his direct financial contribution to her.

15     For avoidance of doubt, I made no finding as regards his allegations of theft on her part. It was also not my finding that she never made any contribution to the business. I was prepared to give some weight to her involvement in assessing her _indirect_ contributions. But I did not accept the thrust of her submissions, which was that in order to recognise the full extent of her contributions, it was necessary to treat part of his direct contributions to the matrimonial assets as hers. I concluded that each party’s direct contributions belonged to that party alone.

16     In determining their respective contributions to the EC, I began with their contributions to the Serangoon flat. I accepted that the Husband made cash payments from 26 Jun 2001, after he became a joint tenant. His cash contributions amounted to $303,683.70. I found the Wife’s cash contribution to amount to $83,297.08 as the claimed additional amount of some $30,0000 was not substantiated. Neither was able to back up their claims as to contributions toward renovations. Other payments went toward indirect contributions. Adding the respective CPF contributions which were not disputed, the Husband contributed a total of $349,805.51 (72%) and the Wife $137,424.22 (28%).

17     As for contributions toward the EC, I accepted that the Husband paid a total of $49,597.80 toward the monthly mortgage. He also paid $17,114.20 toward the renovations. The Wife claimed equal contribution of these amounts by virtue of her contribution to the business, but as I have explained, I treated these as the Husband’s sole contributions. Other amounts the Husband claimed to have paid for would go toward indirect contributions. In the circumstances, respective contributions were as follows:

#### Indirect contributions

19     As for the parties’ indirect contributions, I note that the parties had no children of their own and hence neither could claim any caregiving contribution in that regard. I found that the Husband did accept into the household the Wife’s son from a previous marriage and, for many years, did take on some parental and financial responsibility toward him. Over the course of the marriage, he had contributed considerably more than the Wife to the day to day expenses of running the household, including the maintenance fees and utilities.

20     Against that, I noted that the Husband’s mother lived with them at the matrimonial home. Although there was a domestic helper who served as her primary caregiver, the Wife would have made contributions toward her care as well. The Wife also had provided some support for the Husband’s business, although this had to be qualified in that her contribution was probably greater in the early years, and that she was also remunerated. Beyond that, the Wife may have taken on other forms of work but appeared not to have made significant indirect financial contributions to the marriage. The domestic helper would have relieved both parties of most of the housework. I did not regard the Wife’s care for the 11 dogs as amounting to her indirect contribution, as the dogs were really hers.

21     On a broad brush basis, I found the respective indirect contributions to be **60:40** in favour of the Husband.

#### Adverse inferences

22     Both sides did argue for an adverse inference to be drawn against the other. The Husband based this primarily on the Wife’s failure to give sufficient support for her claims regarding her direct contributions toward the matrimonial home. The Wife’s argument seemed primarily to be that since the Husband’s expenses exceeded his means, he must have under-declared his income. She also contended that he had kept cash and/or valuables in the household safe away from her (the Husband counter-alleged the same against her).

23     The dispute over the contents of the safe came to nought when a joint inspection was carried out. The safe had nothing of great value and neither side’s allegations were established. Beyond that, I had some doubts over the Wife’s claim to only earn $840 when her earning capacity was obviously much higher, even as a Grab driver which she was for some time previously. As for the Husband, there were sizeable drawings from the business’ back account in 2015 and 2016 that may not be sufficiently accounted for, though these did occur sometime back and I have insufficient basis to find that they were carried out in contemplation of the divorce. I was eventually prepared to give both sides the benefit of the doubt and was not persuaded to draw an adverse inference either way.

#### Overall proportion

24     There was no need for other adjustments and no reason to attach greater weightage to either the direct or the indirect contributions. Hence, taking an average of both ratios, I determined the final proportion for division to be **65%** to the Husband and **35%** to the Wife.

#### Spousal maintenance

25     As for spousal maintenance, the Wife sought lump sum maintenance based on a multiplier of 10.5 years. The Husband argued that there should be no maintenance for her.

26     The issue of maintenance for the wife is supplemental to the division of the matrimonial property, in that the court always takes into account what is already awarded to the wife under the division. Especially where the award results in reasonably sufficient resources being placed at her immediate disposal, spousal maintenance, even of a nominal sum, is not always awarded.

27     This could be so even in what is usually regarded as the most deserving of cases, where the wife was a homemaker who made huge financial sacrifices in order to be a full-time homemaker nurturing the children of the marriage (though, of course, such contributions are always duly considered in the division of matrimonial property). There is _no_ presumption in favour of spousal maintenance and _no_ legal requirement that it must always be ordered. The decision in _ATE v ATD_ \[2016\] SCGA 2 clearly bears this out, as do the cases surveyed in the written judgment of that case (see \[35\] to \[40\]).

28     This position is probably consistent with the reality that, with the divorce, the marriage is now well and truly over. Mutual conjugal obligations end, and, especially in a childless marriage, parties ought to have zero basis for _any_ ongoing expectation of each other. As this new reality sets in, it may well be that the Husband cannot be required to continue act as a general insurer over the Wife and guarantor of her provision of any sort, and certainly not for years after the divorce.

29     On the facts of this case, I decided to order only what was sufficient to help the Wife transition out of the marriage. I noted the following:

(a)     The parties were in their mid-fifties, and both were still economically productive. To whatever extent the Wife may now not be earning as much as she may hope to, it was not because of contributions she had to make to the marriage. The childless marriage clearly did not result in her having to make sacrifices which reduced her income earning capacity (e.g. give up a high-paying job to care for children of the marriage);

(b)     The Wife continued to have earning capacity. She was working as a Grab driver for some time and the only explanation for not continuing with that was that her car was scrapped. I did not find that explanation persuasive and the Wife’s submissions did not point to any evidence or any other reason why she was unable to restart this in one form or another;

(c)     There was an existing order for the Husband to pay her $450 a month and partial reimbursement toward expenses in relation to the 11 dogs. I found that the dogs were really the Wife’s, or at least mostly hers. In any event, the Husband’s responsibility over her dogs cease, hence reimbursement of dog-related expenses ought also to end immediately;

(d)     It is not disputed that the Husband has an aged mother in poor health condition whose personal resources are limited and whom he has to take financial responsibility for. On the Wife’s part, there was no indication of a need to provide support to any dependents. Her grown son is financially independent, and

(e)     Although she may not get the full share of the matrimonial assets she expected, she will receive a rather substantial proportion, and in cash.

30     As against the above, I noted that she would have to move out of the EC. To support her transition out of the marriage, I was prepared to order that nine months’ maintenance be paid to her, at the existing sum of $450 per month. Satisfied that payment of this sum on a lump-sum basis would not cripple the Husband, I ordered payment on that basis to give parties a clean break from each other.

#### The orders

31     Accordingly, I made the following orders:

1)     The matrimonial assets valued at $836,871.00 are to be divided in the proportion of 65% to the Husband and 35% to the Wife.

2)     Within 3 months of the date of this Order,

(a)       The Wife is to transfer (other than by sale) her rights, title and interest in the executive condominium at xxx Singapore xxx (“the executive condominium”) to the Husband, who is to bear the costs of the transfer;

(b)       The parties’ OCBC joint account shall be closed and, out of the available balance, the sum of $180,616.61 is to be paid to the Wife and the remainder to the Husband, and

(c)       The Husband is to pay the Wife the sum of $4,050, being 9 months’ maintenance.

3)     The Registrar/Assistant Registrar of the Family Justice Courts is empowered to execute, sign or indorse all necessary documents relating to the transfer of the executive condominium on behalf of either party under Section 31 of the Family Justice Act, should either party fail to do so within seven days of a written request being made to the other party.

4)     MOxxx/2016 is rescinded.

5)     Each party is to retain the assets held in individual names.

6)     Liberty to apply.

7)     No order as to costs.

32     I mentioned earlier that I agree for the value of the assets of xxx Trading to be added to the matrimonial pool, as contended for by the Wife. If so, I would be prepared to include the sum of $90,000.00 in the matrimonial pool. The pool of assets would then add up to $926,871.00. Given my finding that the sum should be regarded as the Husband’s sole contribution, the ratio of both parties’ direct financial contributions would be 73:26 in favour of the Husband (instead of 70:30 as in paragraph 18). With indirect contributions standing at 60:40 in favour of the Husband, the final proportion would be 66.5% to the Husband and 33.5% to the Wife.

33     While her proportion may be lowered, her share is increased as it is now based on a larger total pool. The Wife’s total share would be $310,501.79. Deducting the assets already held in her name, the sum to be paid to her out of the joint account should be $198,273.55 instead of $180,616.61 as indicated in paragraph 2(b) of the orders. As that amount now exceeds the account balance in the joint account, the Husband should pay her the shortfall out of his own monies.
