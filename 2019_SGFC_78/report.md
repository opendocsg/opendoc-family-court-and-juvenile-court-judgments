Variation of Maintenance – Material Change in circumstances

23 July 2019

### District Judge Wendy Yu:

## Introduction

1       The parties were married on xxx 2007, and Final Judgment was granted on 2 March 2016. The parties have one daughter, namely B born on xxx 2010. The Plaintiff husband is a medical doctor[^1]. The Defendant wife was working with the xxx.[^2]

2       Part of the orders made by consent in the interim judgment granted on 26 November 2015 were as follows:

> _“…._

> (_e_)     _That the Plaintiff shall pay $2,000.00 each month as maintenance for the Defendant on the 15th day of November 2015 and thereafter on the 15th day of each month. Payment into the Defendant’s POSB Bank Account number xxx-xxxxx-x._

> (_f_)     _That the Plaintiff shall pay maintenance for the child solely and shall reimburse all expenses spent by the Defendant on the child whilst the child is in the Defendant’s care and control. All expenses shall be made before the 30th day of each month and be paid into the Defendant’s POSB account number xxx-xxxxx-x.”_

3       Both parties have agreed by consent that they both be granted joint custody care and control of B, with each party having care and control for 2 ½ days during weekdays and for weekends, and for each party to have care and control to B on alternate weekends[^3].

4       The Plaintiff filed an application[^4] on 14 December 2018 to vary the above orders. The Plaintiff was seeking for an order that there to be no maintenance for the Defendant, and for the child’s expenses to be borne by parties equally.

## The Plaintiff’s Submissions

5       The Plaintiff’s application is based on a material change in circumstances – that he has been adversely affected since the consent order was made, namely the business slump and that he consequently faced a loss of income over 3 years. The Plaintiff has also argued that he has incurred, and continues to incur various debts[^5]. The Plaintiff has also contended that he was in “poor financial shape” because of business failure, resignation of directorship from the Plaintiff’s company as well as increased expenses due to his subsequent re-marriage and having to provide for his step-son[^6].

6       In this regard, the Plaintiff’s counsel had cited the case of **_THG v LGH <span class="citation">\[1996\] SGHC 65</span>_** in their submissions to support his position that the High Court had taken into consideration a Husband’s financial obligations to another family once he is remarried.

7       The Plaintiff’s counsel has also highlighted Section 68 of the Women’s Charter to reinforce their point that there should be joint duty of both parents to maintain a child[^7].

## The Defendant’s Submissions

8       The Defendant has objected to the Plaintiff’s application for variation and has stated that there has been no material circumstances that has affected the Plaintiff adversely.[^8] The Defendant has also argued that the Plaintiff does not seem to have any financial problems engaging lawyers to bring this application to Court and pay the maintenance ordered.[^9] The Defendant has instead submitted that the Plaintiff’s financial position has in fact improved since 2015[^10] and that the “poor business” was already in existence at the end of 2015[^11]. The Defendant’s position is that despite the Plaintiff’s assertion of financial difficulty, the Plaintiff has had the means to remarry in September 2017[^12] and still maintain a luxurious lifestyle.

9       The Defendant’s counsel has also cited the High Court case of **_ATS v ATT_** **<span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 196</span>** to advance their submission that “a variation application that seeks to rely on circumstances prior to the order for maintenance should be rejected”[^13] and that “the Court must be vigilant to sieve out unmeritorious applications and to ensure finality in the judicial process.”

## Orders Made

10     I first heard the parties on 13 March 2019 and had directed the parties to file a further affidavit to furnish any evidence on whether the Defendant was employed when the consent order was entered into. The Plaintiff filed his supplementary affidavit on 3 April 2019, and the Defendant filed her supplementary affidavit on 4 April 2019. I was of the view that this was a relevant issue in the determination of whether there was a material change in circumstances. In the supplementary affidavit filed by the Defendant, she had confirmed that she was on no-pay leave from her employment with the xxx from 25 September 2015 to 24 September 2016, which was extended up to April 2018.[^14] The Plaintiff asserted in his affidavit that “the Defendant had quit her job in 2015” and that was why he had agreed to help with expenses and had agreed to a spousal maintenance of $2,000.[^15] The Plaintiff further added that the Defendant left for Korea on 28 August 2015.[^16]

11     After hearing the parties on 10 April 2019, I was satisfied that there was a material change in circumstances since the order of 26 November 2015 with the Defendant previously being on no pay leave and is currently receiving a regular salary and I made the following orders:

> “That paragraph 3(e) of the Interim Judgment dated 26 November 2015 be varied to read as “The Plaintiff shall pay a monthly sum of $1,200 to the Defendant with effect from 15th day of April 2019 and thereafter on the 15th day of each month.

> For paragraph 3(f) of the Interim Judgment dated 26 November 2015 to be varied to “The Plaintiff shall reimburse 60% of the child’s expenses when the child is with the Defendant. The Plaintiff shall bear 80% and the Defendant shall bear 20% of the school fees and fees for agreed enrichment classes”.

## Appeal

12     The Plaintiff has appealed against the entire order. I will now give my reasons for my decision.

## The Law

13     The Court’s power to vary an ancillary order for child maintenance is found in Section 127 read with Section 72 of the Women’s Charter, while Section 118 of the Women’s Charter empowers the Court to vary an ancillary order for wife maintenance. Both provisions are reproduced here as follows:

> _“72(1_)     _On the application of any person receiving or ordered to pay a monthly allowance under this Part and on proof of a change in the circumstances of that person, or that person’s wife, incapacitated husband or child, or for other good cause being shown to the satisfaction of the Court, the Court by which the order was made may rescind the order or may vary it as it thinks fit.”_

> _“118_.     _The Court may at any time vary or rescind any subsisting order for maintenance, whether secured or unsecured, on the application of the person in whose favour or of the person against whom the order was made, or, in respect of secured maintenance, of the legal personal representatives of the latter, where it is satisfied that the order was based on any misrepresentation or mistake of fact or where there has been any material change in the circumstances.”_

## Material Change in circumstances

14     I had to determine if there were material change in circumstances which would warrant a variation in the maintenance sum. I will first state my views on the various reasons given by the Plaintiff to justify a material change in circumstances.

15     Firstly, on the issue of business failure and resignation of directorship from the Plaintiff’s company, loss of income for over 3 years since 2015 and debts accrued by the Plaintiff- I accepted the Defendant’s submission from the case of **_ATS v ATT[^17]_** that a variation application that sought to rely on circumstances prior to the order for maintenance should be rejected.

16     The consent order was entered into on 26 November 2015. From the Plaintiff’s own evidence, he was earning $9,000 to $11,000 a month when he was employed as a full time doctor at the xxx Medical Group in November 2015.[^18] The Plaintiff is currently working as a full-time self-employed locum medical practitioner[^19]. During the hearing, the Plaintiff’s counsel has confirmed the evidence[^20] that the Plaintiff’s current average monthly gross salary is in the region of $17,936.89[^21]. I was not persuaded that the Plaintiff had suffered a loss of income since 2015 to constitute a material _adverse_ change in circumstances. The business failure and resignation of directorship was already taking place when the consent order was entered into in November 2015. The Plaintiff had already suffered a change to his income prior to the original order.

17     The loans that the Plaintiff had taken up were in September 2015 (SCB Personal Loan)[^22], in October 2015 (DBS Personal Loan)[^23], March 2016 (UOB Personal Loan)[^24]. There was another loan taken up in December 2017[^25]. While 2 out of 4 of these loans were taken up after the Consent Order was made in November 2015, The Plaintiff in his own submission has highlighted the existence of “the debts that had been accrued since before the order was first made in November 2015”.[^26] As stated in the Plaintiff’s own submissions, the cash injections into xxx Medical Group and reduction of the Plaintiff’s salary had already happened from 2012 to 2015, before the Consent Order was entered into[^27]. The maintenance of $2,000 for the Defendant was agreed upon despite the Plaintiff’s awareness of the existence of such debts back then. I would not consider this to justify a material change in circumstances.

18     The Plaintiff has also argued that there has been a change in circumstances because of his remarriage on 29 September 2017[^28]. The Plaintiff currently provides a monthly maintenance of $2,000[^29] to his current wife, who is a dentist by profession. The Plaintiff’s current wife’s Notice of Assessment dated 4 May 2017 has stated her income assessed then to be $160,000- which works out to be in the region of $13,333.00 per month before it was reduced, as stated in her Notice of Assessment dated 11 June 2018[^30]. This is indicative of her strong earning capacity and would be a relevant consideration on the extent that the Plaintiff has to maintain his current wife. On the Plaintiff’s argument that his remarriage has added to his financial commitments, it is trite that remarriage per se should not affect the pre-existing obligations that a husband owes to the wife and children from a previous marriage although the Court may consider the fresh financial commitments that the Plaintiff has towards his new family. However, it is not reasonable to consider the Plaintiff’s remarriage as a material change in circumstances where the husband has failed or refused to trim his current expenses.

19     In his own evidence, the Plaintiff was currently providing his current wife $2,000 as maintenance, spending $2,421.88[^31] monthly on his food, $1,035 monthly on Uber/Grab services, $564.43 on petrol and $309 for private car parks even though the Plaintiff has claimed that he has had to sell his car in 2016 as he was no longer able to financially sustain maintaining a vehicle[^32]. The Plaintiff has also claimed that the monthly expenses of B has amounted to be more than $19,000[^33] (including considerable expenses such as $1,000 for “birthday party” and $1,040 for “outings at restaurants on weekends”), which seems extremely excessive for a 8 year old child. While I did consider whether the maintenance of more than $19,000 was for a year or a month, with some items being yearly fees (eg. ‘magazine subscription yearly fees’ for $120), the various items were expressed to be monthly expenses in the Plaintiff’s affidavit and I would think that the Plaintiff’s counsel would have advised him that the norm in maintenance hearings is to provide a List of Expenses for monthly expenses, which the Plaintiff has done so for his own expenses. I noted that the Plaintiff did not furnish any receipts to substantiate any of the child’s expenses save for the American Express supplementary credit card statements of the expenses from 2014 to 2017 incurred by the Defendant (which included some expenses for the child)[^34] and statements in 2018 for the fibrenet internet plan of the Defendant’s home[^35]. If this has been the luxurious standard of living that the Plaintiff has been choosing to provide the child with, it certainly does not paint a picture of a father who has been struggling to meet his financial obligations or how his remarriage has restricted his financial capacity.

20     However, there is one material factor which I will take into consideration to make a determination that there has been a material change in circumstances. The Defendant has stated that at the time of the divorce she was working with the xxx[^36] and has only started work again in April 2018[^37], with a current gross income of $4,940.00[^38]. I was satisfied that the Defendant was on no pay leave when the consent order was entered into, and is currently receiving a regular salary on a full time job. This, in my view, is a material change in circumstances which warranted a lowering of her maintenance.

21     To what extent should the Defendant’s monthly maintenance be lowered? The extent of the duty to provide maintenance rests on a host of factors as enumerated by s 114(1) of the Women’s Charter which includes the income, earning capacity, other financial resources of parties, the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future as well as the standard of living enjoyed by the family before the breakdown of marriage. It was therefore open to the Court to consider other factors, including the relative circumstances of both parties, in making the maintenance orders.

22     On the factor of financial resources and obligations, I note that the Defendant still has a loan of $321,620.02 as at December 2018 on the apartment[^39] that she co-owns with her retired mother which is currently used as a roof over her head and for the child, which she has to service monthly. Comparing the parties’ earning capacity and income, the Plaintiff’s current average monthly gross salary is in the region of $17,936.89[^40] while the Defendant’s gross monthly salary is $4,940.00[^41]. One of the factors that I have taken into consideration is the standard of living that the parties enjoyed before the breakdown of the marriage- which can be gleaned from the kind of expenses that the Plaintiff had accepted in the past and has provided, as well as the original amount of $2,000 maintenance which the Plaintiff had agreed to pay the Defendant in the consent order. Considering all the above factors, it is reasonable for the monthly maintenance of $2,000 for the Defendant to be reduced to $1,200.

#### Child Maintenance

23     The Plaintiff in his submissions has highlighted Section 68[^42] of the Women’s Charter to set out the joint duty of both parents to maintain their children.

24     In coming to my decision, I bore in mind the _dicta_ of the Honourable Justice Kan Ting Chiu in **_TBC v TBD (2015) SGHC 130_** that the starting point should be that parents bear the financial burden equally and one parent’s burden should not be increased just because the other parent is less well off, that there should be in fact not be a norm that parents should contribute in proportion to their means.

25     However, in the recent Court of Appeal case in **_BPC v BPB (2019) SGCA 03_**, the Husband in that case had submitted that the Judge at the Court below should have ordered the parties to each bear half of all expenses incurred for the children because both parties have a joint and equal obligation to maintain their children, under Section 68 of the Charter. The Court of Appeal had expressly disagreed with this submission at \[111\] that Section 68 mandates such a result and opined as follows:

> “_Although parents do indeed share an equal responsibility for looking after their children, this ought not to necessarily translate into each parent bearing an equal share of the burden to provide maintenance for their children. This is because the extent of the duty to provide maintenance rests on a host of factors as enumerated by s 114(1) of the Charter:_

>> (_a_)     _the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;_

>> (_b_)     _the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;_

>> (_c_)     _the standard of living enjoyed by the family before the breakdown of the marriage;_

>> (_d_)     _the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage;_

>> (_e_)     _any physical or mental disability of either of the parties to the marriage;_

>> (_f_)     _the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family; and_

>> (_g_)     _in the case of proceedings for divorce or nullity of marriage, the value to either of the parties to the marriage of any benefit (for example, a pension) which, by reason of the dissolution or annulment of the marriage that party will lose the chance of acquiring._

> _It was therefore open to the Judge to consider other factors, including the relative circumstances of both parties, in making the maintenance orders_.”

26     In deciding the proportion of child maintenance payable by each parent, it was open to the Court to consider other factors, including the relative circumstances of both parties, such as the income and earning capacity of both parties. Considering the similar factors that I have stated at paragraph \[22\] above, I am of the view that it is not reasonable to order the Defendant to pay half of the child’s expenses (especially if the Plaintiff’s position is that the child’s expenses were more than $19,000 each month). I was of the view that it is reasonable for the Plaintiff to reimburse 60% of the child’s expenses when the child is with the Defendant. I also ordered that the Plaintiff shall bear 80% and the Defendant shall bear 20% of the school fees and fees for agreed enrichment classes. The apportionment was done after hearing both lawyers as to the most convenient way to apportion the expenses of the child as the child spends a significant amount of time with both parents.

27     I had also ordered the Plaintiff to pay costs of $750 to the Defendant as the Plaintiff did not succeed entirely in his application even though I had granted the application for variation.
