Family Law – children’s maintenance – s69(2), Women’s Charter

23 November 2020

### District Judge Suzanne Chin:

## Introduction

1       This case involved the application by the complainant Mother (“Mother”) against the respondent Father (“Father”) for maintenance for the 2 children of the marriage under section 69(2) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353).

2       After hearing from both parties, I dismissed the Mother’s application. Dissatisfied with my orders, the Mother has filed an appeal against my decision and I now set forth below the reasons for my decision.

## Background

3       The parties are both nationals of the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) and Singapore permanent residents. The parties were married in the PRC on 4 February 1997 under PRC law and have 2 children – a son who is currently 20 years old and serving national service and a daughter who is 19 years of age.

4       On 18 November 2015, the parties registered their divorce in the PRC and entered into an agreement setting out the terms of their divorce (“Divorce Agreement”). The Divorce Agreement provided amongst other things for the Father to pay a sum of RMB 12,000 (SGD 2,400) per month as maintenance for the 2 children until they turned 18 years of age. The Divorce Agreement also provided that the matrimonial flat in Singapore would continue to be occupied by the Mother after the divorce.

5       On 10 September 2019, the parties entered into a mediation agreement which was endorsed by the People’s Court of Zicheng District, Beijing City in the PRC (“Mediation Agreement”). By virtue of this agreement, the matrimonial flat in Singapore was to be transferred to the Mother free of all consideration. At the time of the hearing the parties informed the court that this transfer was being effected.

## The Mother’s claim at the hearing

6       At the start of the hearing when asked what she was asking for under her application for children’s maintenance, the Mother informed the court that she was asking for a lump sum amount of $200,000. This was notwithstanding she had indicated in her complaint form that she was requesting for a sum of $1,200 per month for each child. When she was asked to clarify how she arrived at the amount of $200,000, the Wife informed the court that this sum included all of the maintenance for the children that had not been paid since the time they had turned 18, upcoming university fees for both children as well as rental that the Father had received for various properties which he had never paid to her. As this was an application for children’s maintenance, I informed the Mother that only claims relating to the children’s maintenance and not issues relating to property between the parties would be considered for the purpose of this hearing.

## The Legal Principles

7       It should be noted that section 68 of the Woman’s Charter sets out the duty of a parent to maintain or contribute to the maintenance of his or her children, whether they are in his or her custody or the custody of the other person, either by providing them with accommodation, clothing, food and education as may be reasonable having regard to his or her means and station in life. In the case of TIT v TIU <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHCF 8</span>, the High Court clarified at \[63\] that the prevailing standard must be reasonableness having regard to all the circumstances of the case, and the best interests of the children, taking into account the financial capabilities of the parents. It is also important to note that Section 46(1) of the Woman’s Charter provides that the parental responsibility falls equally on both the mother and the father.

8       Section 69(2) provides that the Court may on due proof that a parent has neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for his child who is unable to maintain himself, order the parent to pay a monthly allowance or a lump sum for the maintenance of the child.

9       The factors that the Courts should consider in making an order for maintenance in addition to all of the circumstances of the case, are set out under section 69(4) of the Women’s Charter as follows:

> (_a_)     _the financial needs of the wife or child;_

> (_b_)     _the income, earning capacity (if any), property and other financial resources of the wife or child;_

> (_c_)     _any physical or mental disability of the wife or child;_

> (_d_)     _the age of each part to the marriage and the duration of the marriage;_

> (_e_)     _the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to the welfare of the family including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family;_

> (_f_)     _the standard of living enjoyed by the wife or child before the husband or parent, as the case may be neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the wife or child;_

> (_g_)     _in the case of the child, the manner in which he was being, and in which the parties to the marriage expected him to be educated or trained; and_

> (_h_)     _the conduct of each of the parties to the marriage, if the conduct is such that it would in the opinion of the court be inequitable to disregard it._

## Preliminary Question – Whether the Mother was disbarred from filing an application under section 69(2) of the Women’s Charter in light of the fact that the parties had already divorced

10     The Father contended that the Mother was in no position to apply for the children’s maintenance under section 69(2) of the Women’s Charter as the parties were already divorced at the time of application. Through counsel, he argued that the overall architecture of the Women’s Charter was such that provisions under part VIII of the Women’s Charter and in particular section 69(2), were intended to cover situations where child maintenance is sought while parties are still married or in the midst of divorce proceedings but upon determination of all ancillary matters (including child maintenance), Part X of the Women’s Charter and in particular s 127 should come into play.

11     While I accepted that part X of the Women’s Charter was intended to address issues relating to divorce as well as all ancillary matters, I did not agree that part VIII of the Women’s Charter could solely be invoked in situations where the parties remained married. Section 69(1) clearly sets out that an application under this section can only be made by a “wife” so it is clear that this provision caters only for interim maintenance for a wife. Section 69(2) however states as follows:

> “The court may, on due proof that a parent has neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for his child who is unable to maintain himself, order that parent to pay a monthly allowance or a lump sum for the maintenance of the child.”

Nowhere in this provision is it specified that the obligation of the parent to pay a monthly allowance for the maintenance of the child is confined to the period that parent remains married to the other parent. In fact, in its application, section 69(2) has been invoked for the application of child maintenance in cases where divorce has already been determined and ancillary orders made. Examples of this would be applications for child maintenance in Syariah Court cases post divorce and ancillary matters orders and in civil cases, where a child who attains the age of 21 years is entitled to maintenance under the provisions of section 69(5).

12     In light of this, I did not accept the Father’s position that the Mother’s application should not be allowed under section 69(2) of the Women’s Charter and proceeded to consider the merits of her application under section 69(2).

## Whether the Father had neglected or failed to provide reasonable maintenance

13     The main issue before the court was whether the Father had neglected or failed to provide reasonable maintenance for the children. In UHA v UHB \[2019\] SGHCF, the honourable Presiding Judge of the Family Justice Courts observed at \[29\] that:

> “…..The burden of proof is on the party claiming maintenance to provide proof that the other party has neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance. To determine whether that burden has been met, it is first necessary to determine what “reasonable maintenance for his child” is on the facts of the case. After determining what the quantum of reasonable maintenance is, the next step is to determine whether the Father had indeed provided, or had neglected or refused to provide such reasonable maintenance...."

### Reasonable maintenance for the children

14     While she maintained her claim of $100,000 per child, the Mother informed the court that the monthly expenses for each child amounted to $1,200. I noted however that in her bundle of documents, the Mother had tendered a completed version of her monthly expenses wherein she claimed that expenses for the children totalled a sum of $2,058 for both children. Upon being asked for clarification by the court, she acknowledged that this was the amount she was claiming for the children’s expenses and informed the court that the amounts in the expense list could just be divided equally between the children. The Father agreed with some of the amounts claimed by the Mother for certain items but disagreed on other items. Set forth in the table below are the amounts claimed by each of the parties for the various items of expenses for the children:

15     The Father qualified that while the above reflects his position on the children’s reasonable expenses, he maintained that he paid for some these items directly. This included the cost of clothes and make up as well as the school expenses for his daughter which he said he paid for upon request by the daughter. He also contended that he paid for meals for the children.

16     I considered each parties’ positions on the children’s expenses and proceeded to determine what I considered to be the reasonable expenses for the children. In this regard I took into account the fact that the son was now in full time National Service and spent most of his time during the week away from home only returning on weekends and perhaps in the evenings, once or twice a week as the Wife had indicated. The table below sets out a breakdown of the detailed expenses of each of the children as determined by the court. I would also mention that the children at this stage were not attending university and it would be sometime before they proceeded to attend university. In addition, no evidence was provided by the Wife as to how much would be payable for each child’s university. In light of this, I did not take this expense into consideration in determining the current expenses for each child.

17     While the Mother appeared to be of the view that the Father should be responsible for bearing all of the expenses of the children, the law is clear on this. Both parents are equally responsible for providing reasonable maintenance for their children. Depending on their means and earning capacities, the actual amount of maintenance payable by each parent would vary.

18     I next turned my attention to looking at the salaries and earning capacities of each of the parties. The Mother declared that she was working as a teacher earning a monthly take home salary of $2,300 per month. On the first day of hearing, she informed the court that she had received a termination letter on 22 June 2020 and while this had not been tendered in her bundle of documents, she provided a copy to court on the 1st day of the trial. In addition to this amount of $2,300, it appeared that the Wife had also been earning additional amounts through some form of self -employment. This was supported by her Notice of Assessment for 2018 and 2020 which showed that in addition to her employment income, she also had trade income (C’s bundle of documents filed on 13 August 2020 at pages 35,36,37). In light of this, I reached the conclusion that the Wife had been earning an average amountof approximately $2,700 since 2017. Even if I accepted that she had lost her job, it would appear that she has the capacity to earn trade income of up to $2,630 per month. In addition, by her own admission, the Mother had informed the court that in 2015, she had rented out 2 rooms in her flat, each at $600 and totalling an amount of $1,200 per month and since the entire property was being transferred to her, there was nothing stopping her from renting out rooms in the flat as she had previously done.

19     The Father ran his own business and before COVID, had frequently travelled to China. He provided salary slips from the company which indicated an average salary of approximately $3,500 per month. The Wife disputed this. Other than indicating to the court that the Father had lied in all of his evidence, she provided no evidence to support her bare assertions.

20     In determining the amount of reasonable maintenance payable by the Father for the children, I also took into consideration the provisions of Section 69(4) of the Women’s Charter and in particular Section 69(4)(h) which provides that when ordering maintenance for a child, the court shall have regard to all circumstances of the case including “the conduct of each of the parties to the marriage, if the conduct is such that it would in the opinion of the court be inequitable to disregard it”.

21     It was not disputed that the parties had divorced in 2015 and had arrived at settlement of issues relating to the children’s maintenance as well as the division of matrimonial property in the Divorce Agreement. The Divorce Agreement clearly stated that the parties had “willingly entered into” the Divorce Agreement. While the Wife claimed during the trial that the Divorce Agreement was incomplete, she provided no details to explain what she meant. In the absence of any other agreement showing otherwise (other than the bare denial of the Mother), I accepted that this Agreement had been entered into freely and willingly by the Parties.

22     According to the Father, when the parties entered into the Divorce Agreement in 2015, there had been a discussion as to who was going to provide for the children’s maintenance from the ages of 18 to 21. This was because PRC laws only permitted the provision of maintenance for the children up to the time they turned 18 years of age. The Father maintains that at the time, he had been paying $1,200 for the monthly maintenance of both children (See R2 filed on 20 August 20, para 9 and at page 21) but in order to provide for maintenance for the children until they reached 21 years of age, the parties agreed that the Father pay twice the amount of maintenance ie $2,400 so as to cater for the maintenance for the children after they each turned 18 and until they turned 21. The Mother did not dispute this and clarified that $1,200 is was the amount that the Father had been paying towards the both children’s maintenance in 2015.

23     The Father also referred to the Mediation Agreement which parties had entered into in September 2019. According to the Father, this Mediation Agreement was entered into by the parties to address issues faced with effecting the transfer of the matrimonial flat to the Mother. He explained that prior to and up to the signing of the Mediation Agreement, the Mother had not at anytime raised any issues of his failing to pay children’s maintenance and it was only after the Mediation Agreement had been signed and steps taken to transfer to the matrimonial flat to her that the Mother filed her application for the children’s maintenance. This was not denied by the Mother and I accepted the Father’s contentions that the Mother had filed this application for children’s maintenance in an attempt to seek additional amounts of children’s maintenance from him.

24     Taking all of the above into consideration, I accepted that the Father had already paid for the children’s maintenance up to the age of 21 based on the agreement reached between the parties and accordingly was under no obligation to pay further maintenance for each of the children.

25     Notwithstanding that I had arrived at the conclusion that the Father had discharged all of his maintenance obligations towards the children, I proceeded to consider the issue of whether based what I considered as the reasonable expenses of the child, the Father had neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the children. In this regard, taking into consideration all of the circumstances of the case, I determined that it would be fair for the parties to share in the children’s expenses in the proportion of 50:50. This would translate into the Father paying a sum of $625 per month for the daughter and $216 per month for the son.

#### Whether the Father had provided reasonable maintenance based on the children’s expenses

26     Following the enquiry referred to in paragraph 21 above, I turned towards considering what exactly the Father had been paying. It was the Father’s position that he had continued to provide reasonable maintenance for the 2 children regardless of the fact that he had fully discharged his maintenance obligations in accordance with the terms of the Divorce Agreement. In this regard, he informed the court that from July 2019 to June 2020, he had paid an average amount of $252 per month for the son and $1,708 per month for the daughter. As the daughter turned 18 in December 2019, I noted that this included the months when he was still paying $1,200 for the daughter’s maintenance. The Father also informed the court that since February of 2020, he had been paying a sum of $600 to the daughter and $300 to the son. In addition he had paid for the daughter’s clothes, make up and school expenses whenever she had asked him.

27     While the Mother did not dispute the fact that the had been paying these amounts directly to the children, she argued that the monies should have been paid to her as the party who had care and control of the children.

28     From the evidence tendered by the parties, it appears that after the Divorce Agreement had been entered into, the Father had initially paid the children’s maintenance to the Complainant. According to him, he subsequently found out that the Mother had unreasonably withheld maintenance amounts from the children and he then started paying the maintenance directly to the children. Looking at the relevant bank statements tendered by the Father (R1 page 39), it appears that this practise of transferring the maintenance monies directly to the children started as far back as in February of 2016 and appeared to have been accepted by the Mother who raised no objections to this arrangement over the years. As the Mother appears to have acquiesed to this arrangement and had not raised any concerns before this application was filed, I reached the conclusion that the Father had by paying the monies referred to above directly to the children, had in fact provided reasonable maintenance for the children.

## Conclusion

29     Having reached the conclusion that the Father had been providing reasonable maintenance to the children, I found that there had been no neglect on the part of the Father and accordingly, I dismissed the Mother’s application for children’s maintenance.
