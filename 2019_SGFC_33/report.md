Guardianship of Infants Act – Maintenance for Children

6 March 2019

### District Judge Tan Shin Yi:

## Background Facts

1       The parties in these proceedings were married in 1997 and they have two sons, aged 9 and 14 years as at the date of my orders (collectively, “the Children”). The Plaintiff wife (“the Mother”), Defendant husband (“the Father”) and the Children are all Australian citizens. The family resided in Australia previously and the parties also divorced there in 2012.

2       In 2014, the Mother accepted a job offer in Singapore and planned to relocate to Singapore with the Children. The relocation was the subject of proceedings in Australia, for which an Independent Child Lawyer (“ICL”) was appointed. Eventually, on 25 June 2015, the parties reached a consent order (“the Australian Consent Order”) for the Mother to relocate to Singapore with the two sons, with generous access to the Father, including access in Australia. The Australian Consent Order did not deal with the issue of maintenance for the Children, save to state that the Mother was to (i) bear the costs of the Children’s airfares to Australia when they travelled there for access with the Father; and (ii) be primarily liable for the elder child’s international school fees.

3       It was stipulated in the Australian Consent Order that the orders were suspended until the parties had obtained “mirror orders” in Singapore, and the Mother consequently commenced OSG proceedings in Singapore (“OSG xxx/2015”). On 14 January 2016, orders were made to mirror the Australian Consent Order (“the Singapore mirror order”).

4       Unfortunately, since 2016, the parties have engaged in prolonged litigation by filing multiple Summons applications to vary the Singapore mirror order. From April 2016 to March 2018, the parties filed a total of 30 applications seeking various orders relating to the access and maintenance of the Children. The majority of the parties’ applications centred around the variation of the access orders and as a result, the Singapore mirror order has been varied several times. I will not elaborate further on the variation applications as they are not relevant to the current appeal which relates only to the maintenance for the Children.

### Maintenance for the children

5       Following the parties’ divorce in Australia in 2012, the Father had applied for the Mother to pay child support via the Child Support Agency (“the Agency”). As a result, there was a Child Support Assessment in place in Australia for the Mother to pay child support/maintenance for the children to the Father. Due to the failure of the Mother to pay the child support assessed, a Departure Prohibition Order was issued against her.

6       On 31 December 2016, the Mother filed a Summons application for, _inter alia_, the Father to pay maintenance for the Children (Summons No. xxx/2017). The main reason for her application was because she wished to “offset” the child support debt she owed to the Father, pursuant to the Child Support Assessment. The Mother’s application was dismissed by me on 11 April 2017, as at the relevant time, the Child Support Assessment was still in place in Australia and I was of the view that there should not be a duplication of orders regarding maintenance for the Children.

### The present appeal

7       On 16 March 2018, the Mother filed the present Summons application for (i) the Father to pay the sum of $7,500 as maintenance for the Children with effect from September 2017 (Summons No. xxx/2018); (ii) the Father to pay for half the costs of the Children’s medical reports; and (iii) variation of the Singapore mirror order such that the Father would bear the costs of the Children’s airfares to Australia for his access.

8       I heard the present application together with several other applications filed by both parties to vary parts of the access orders. On 22 November 2018, I made the following orders relating to the present application:

(a)     The Father is to pay the sum of $2,400 per month to the Mother for the Children’s maintenance with effect from April 2018.

(b)     The Father is to bear 30% of the costs of the Children’s medical reports, being the sum of $2,830 (rounded up) and to pay this sum of $2,830 to the Mother forthwith.

(c)     No order on the prayer for the Father to bear the costs of the Children’s airfares to Australia for access.

9       On 6 December 2018, the Father filed his Notice of Appeal _only_ against the order for him to pay the sum of $2,400 per month to the Mother for the Children’s maintenance with effect from April 2018. The following are my reasons for the said order.

### Child Support Assessment

10     It was not disputed that sometime in August/September 2014, the Husband had obtained a Child Support Assessment from the Agency in Australia against the Mother. Sometime in 2017, after obtaining legal advice, the Mother applied to the Agency to terminate the Child Support Assessment. It was also not disputed that as at 22 August 2017, the Child Support Assessment in Australia relating to maintenance for the Children ended. The Mother obtained an affidavit from an Australian solicitor confirming that, based on the documents issued by the Agency which had been provided to her, the Agency was no longer regulating child support for the Children from 22 August 2017 onwards. This was not disputed by the Father.

### The Children’s Expenses

11     The Mother submitted that the Children’s total expenses come up to almost $15,000 each month, including their share of the household expenses. In her application, she sought maintenance for the Children in the sum of $7,500 per month backdated to September 2017.

12     The Mother had submitted that the Children’s expenses were as follows:

13     The Mother averred that the Children have been put on a gluten-free, dairy-free and organic diet due to their chronic health issues such as bad acne flare-ups and stomach aches. Even if it is accepted that the Children need to be on a special diet, I was of the view that the Children’s monthly expenses of almost $15,000 were extravagant and excessive. For example, there was no need to incur expenses for after-school student care when the younger child can return home after school under the care of the domestic helper; and I was of the view that a 9-year-old would not require a personal trainer who is specially trained in children issues and costs $560 per month, especially if he is already attending counselling and therapy.

14     Further, I noted that the parties’ intention and agreement in the Australian Consent Order (and captured in the Singapore mirror order) was that the Mother would be primarily liable for the elder child’s international school fees and as a result, I deducted his school fees from the total sum submitted as the Mother should be paying for this.

### The Parties’ Means

15     The Father is currently 50 years old and is self-employed as a mortgage broker and real estate agent in Australia. He submitted that his annual income has been low for the past few years, and that his taxable income for the year 2017 was only about AUD1,250.50 per month. However, the Mother disagreed that the Father was only earning AUD1,250.50 per month and claimed that the Father had other income and cash resources which he had not disclosed. For example, the Father produced only one bank account statement for the period 12 April to 31 May 2018, and this showed that he had received total deposits of AUD11,565 for that month (including AUD4,980 from the Father’s sister).

16     The Father has a university degree and prior to 2012, he worked as a business manager with the xxx Services for at least 8 years, earning between AUD5,800 – 6,200 per month. The Father objected to the Mother’s application for maintenance for the children, but did not propose any amount payable.

17     The Mother is also about 50 years old and works as a tax director. Her monthly income is about $10,700 nett, and she claimed that she incurred large debts as a result of the shortfall between her income and the Children’s expenses. The Father disputed that most of the Children’s expenses have to be incurred, on the basis that he can also take them to the relevant service providers in Australia, such as medical and dental expenses which are free. However, it must be noted that these expenses are essential or necessary, and are usually incurred by the parent with care and control; it would not be possible to take the Children to a doctor or a dentist only during the Father’s access, for example.

18     The relevant factors in determining a reasonable quantum of maintenance for children are the needs of the children, the financial capacity of the parents and the standard of living the parties and children are used to. It is not disputed that the parties and Children were used to a reasonably comfortable standard of living when they were all living together in Australia.

19     While the Father claimed that his monthly income was less than SGD2,000, I was of the view that he did in fact have a higher earning capacity, of at least SGD5,000 per month. It was the Father’s choice to remain self-employed and as a result, to also choose how much income he wished to disclose/declare. If he was really earning a low income, as he claimed, then there was no reason why he could not try to obtain more business, or switch careers and obtain at least a stable paying job. While the Father is not young, he was physically healthy and there did not seem to be any reason why he could not find work which would pay him a better, more stable salary. It was also admitted by the Father that he frequently travelled to Singapore in the past to visit the Children and before his mother’s demise in 2017, he frequently travelled to Indonesia. When the Father was in Singapore, he often put up at the Genting Hotel near the Children’s residence, and bought the Children gifts and took them on outings. This did not support the Father’s claim that he was really a man of no or little financial means.

20     Having regard to the above factors and all other relevant circumstances of the case, I was of the view that a reasonable quantification for the monthly expenses of the Children is around $7,750 (being about $3,800 for their share of the household expenses, $1,550 for the elder child’s expenses and $2,400 for the younger child’s expenses). I was also of the view that both parents ought to contribute towards the Children’s living expenses, and that, taking into account both parties’ earning capacity and means, it would be just and reasonable for the Father to bear about 30% of the Children’s monthly expenses. This would amount to almost $2,400 per month. I therefore ordered that the Father is to pay the sum of $2,400 per month to the Mother for the Children’s maintenance.

### Backdating of maintenance

21     The Mother had requested that the Children’s maintenance be backdated to September 2017, as the Child Support Assessment had been terminated in August 2017. However, the Mother only filed her application for maintenance for the Children in March 2018. I was of the view that if the Mother was really in dire need of maintenance, it would not have taken her more than 6 months to file the relevant application. Further, the Mother’s own evidence was that she had already sought legal advice sometime in August 2017, and there was therefore no logical explanation for the application having only been filed in April 2018. This was balanced against the prejudice caused to the Father if I were to backdate the maintenance to September 2017. In the circumstances, I was only minded to backdate the order for the Children’s maintenance to April 2018, which is the date of filing of the application.
