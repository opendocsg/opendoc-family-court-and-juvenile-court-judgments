Family Law – Care and control of and access to children, Maintenance for children, Maintenance for Wife; Division of matrimonial property

13 March 2019

### District Judge Christine Lee:

### Introduction

1       The present appeal is by the Husband against the greater part of the Court’s decision made on 29 November 2018 regarding the issues of care and control of, and access to the 2 children, maintenance payable for the 2 children, maintenance payable for the Wife and division of the matrimonial property.

### Background

2       The Plaintiff Wife (“the Respondent Wife”) and the Defendant Husband (“the Appellant Husband”) married on xxxx in Singapore. There are two (2) children of the marriage namely, B (f) DoB xxx now aged 8 years and C (f) DoB xxx now aged 5+ years (“the said 2 children”).

3       The marriage lasted about 6 years before the Respondent Wife filed Writ of Divorce on 20 July 2017. The Appellant Husband filed his Counterclaim on 18 August 2017 which was amended on 1 December 2017.

4       This matter was set down on an uncontested basis based on both the Statement of Claim and Counterclaim (Amendment No 1 dated 1 December 2017) after the Defence and Reply to Defence and Counterclaim were withdrawn on 29 November 2017.

5       On 9 January 2018, Interim Judgement (IJ) was therefore granted based on the fact that the Respondent Wife had sufficiently proven the contents of the Statement of Claim and the Appellant Husband had sufficiently proven the contents of the Counterclaim (Amendment No 1 dated 1 December 2017) and the marriage was dissolved by reason that the Appellant Husband had behaved in such a way that the Respondent Wife could not reasonably be expected to live with the Appellant Husband and that the Respondent Wife had behaved in such a way that the Appellant Husband could not reasonably be expected to live with the Respondent Wife. CFRC Certificate was issued on 15 January 2018.

### Hearings before the Court

6       The Court dealt with the Ancillary Matters (AM) of this case on two hearing days namely, 28 September 2018 and 13 November 2018 and adjourned the matter for decision. According to the Statement of Claim and Counterclaim (Amendment No 1 dated 1 December 2017), there were 8 AMs to be decided by the Court.

7       These were:

i.     Custody, care and control of the said 2 children;

ii.     Access to the said 2 children;

iii.     Maintenance for the said 2 children;

iv.     Maintenance for the Respondent Wife;

v.     Division of matrimonial assets;

vi.     Division of the matrimonial property;

vii.     Costs and

viii.     Other Relief

8       After the conclusion of the AM hearings, the Court delivered its decision on all 8 AMs on 29 November 2018.

9       The Appellant Husband filed Notice of Appeal on 13 December 2018 in HCF/DCA 150/2018 against most of the provisions of the Court’s decision in the Court Order (“the said Court Order”) issued on 29 November 2018.

**Paragraph 5 of the said Court Order** **:**

**Division of matrimonial property**

5.1    The Parties share of the matrimonial home at xxx (“the matrimonial property”) shall be apportioned as follows: Plaintiff – **55%** and Defendant – **45%.**

5.2    Subject to the approval of the Housing Development Board (HDB) and the Central Provident Fund Board (CPF Board), the Defendant shall transfer (other than by way of sale) all his rights, title and interests in the matrimonial home at xxx ("the matrimonial property") to the Plaintiff upon the Plaintiff making refund of **$47,000** to the Defendant’s CPF Ordinary Account within three (3) months of the date of Final Judgement. In the event of a shortfall, this refund shall be considered as a partial refund.

5.3    In such case, the Plaintiff shall take over and be liable for repayment of the outstanding mortgage loan on the matrimonial property. The Plaintiff shall also bear all costs and expenses of the said transfer.

5.4    In the event that the Plaintiff is not able to effect the above transfer within the time prescribed and also subject to the approval of the HDB and CPF Board, the Plaintiff shall transfer (other than by way of sale) all her rights, title and interests in the matrimonial home at xxx ("the matrimonial property") to the Defendant upon the Defendant making refund of **$57,500** to the Plaintiff’s CPF Ordinary Account within one (1) month of the expiry of the above 3-month period.

5.8    To remove all doubt, the net proceeds refers to the balance amount of the compensation received for the matrimonial property after deducting the outstanding mortgage loan and all payments that may be due to the HDB and all costs and expenses related to the surrender.

5.9    Upon receipt of his/her share of the net proceeds, the Parties shall refund to his/her own CPF account, the monies which he/she utilized for the purchase of the matrimonial property including accrued interests, in accordance with the CPF legislation and requirements. In the event of a shortfall, these refunds shall be considered as partial refunds.

5.10  The Registrar or Assistant Registrar of the Family Justice Courts under section 31 of the Family Justice Act 2014 is empowered to execute, sign or endorse all necessary documents relating to the matters contained in this order on behalf of either party should either party fail to so within seven (7) days of the written request being made to the party.

5.11  The Parties, including the HDB and CPF Board, shall be at liberty to apply for further directions or orders generally.

11     Therefore, in essence, the Appellant Husband’s appeal is based on four issues being (i) that care and control of the said 2 children was awarded to the Respondent Wife (ii) the maintenance payable for the said 2 children (iii) the maintenance payable for the Respondent Wife and (iv) the division of the matrimonial property.

### Summary of the Court’s reasons for making its Order

## Care and Control of and Access to the said 2 children

12     The Court noted that both Parties had agreed to joint custody but each wanted care and control of the said 2 children then aged 7½ years and nearly 5 years. Due to the relative young age of the said 2 children, the Court was of the view that it was important to obtain details on the usual routine and care arrangements for the said 2 children.

13     The evidence before the Court was that both Parties were dependent, or going to be dependent on their respective parents to assist them in the care of the said 2 children. As there were allegations of health concerns regarding their respective parents, the Court directed that additional Affidavits be filed to assist the Court in understanding the roles that the parents of both Parties were going to play in the care of the said 2 children.

14     The Court’s final assessment was that the Appellant Husband’s reliance on his parents was the same as the Respondent Wife’s intended reliance on her mother to assist both of them in their respective care of the said 2 children and therefore this was a neutral factor.

15     The Court then proceeded to ascertain from the evidence and submissions before it, as to who was the primary caregiver of the said 2 children. In this regard the Court considered the details submitted by the Respondent Wife as to the daily care and routine of the said 2 children[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1). The Court considered this against the Appellant Husband’s statements in his first Affidavit[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) and the elaborations in his second Affidavit[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3).

16     The Court was of the view that the facts showed that the said 2 children had a stronger bond with the Respondent Wife and that she had done her best to be a good parent to both of them. Therefore, the Court’s assessment was that the Respondent Wife was the primary caregiver of the said 2 children.

17     In addition, much ado was made by the Appellant Husband that the Respondent Wife was not a good role model for the said 2 children in view of her alleged affairs with other men. The Court noted that the Appellant Husband’s conduct was also not completely without blame. The Respondent Wife had stated[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4) that the Appellant Husband had an affair whilst she was pregnant with the younger child. The Appellant Husband admitted to this affair[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5).

18     At the same time, the Respondent Wife submitted[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6) that the Appellant Husband had also had improper associations to which the Appellant Husband denied[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7). In fact, the Appellant Husband made a specific application to obtain leave for the filing of his third Affidavit in order to respond to these allegations.

19     The Court noted that the Appellant Husband expressed remorse for the affair and made specific denial of the alleged improper associations. However, whilst the Appellant Husband also made a general denial to the Respondent Wife’s other assertions, the Appellant Husband did not at any time in his second or third Affidavits[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8), respond to the Respondent Wife’s statement, made in both her AOM and 2nd AM Affidavit[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9), that when she was 9 months’ pregnant with the younger child, the Appellant Husband had told her to “_just tell the baby her father is dead_”. The Court considered this to be relevant as it was supportive of the Respondent Wife’s submissions that it was in the best interests of both the said 2 children that she be awarded care and control of them.

20     After taking into account all the circumstances of the case, the Court was of the view that the Respondent Wife should continue to be the primary caregiver of the said 2 children and thereby awarded care and control of the said 2 children to the Respondent Wife.

21     Immediately after the Court had delivered its decision on care and control of the said 2 children to the Respondent Wife, the Court was informed by the Appellant Husband's Counsel that the Appellant Husband had by text messaging, made allegations against the Respondent Wife[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10) which he had wanted the Court to be informed of, because the Appellant Husband was of the view that the Respondent Wife was not fit to be awarded care and control of the said 2 children.

22     The Court noted with concern that the information which the Appellant Husband had attempted to provide at the last minute through his Counsel, was evidence from the Bar and was only provided after the Court had delivered its decision on the issue of care and control of the said 2 children, which was not in the Appellant Husband’s favour.

23     The Court had, in making its decision to award care and control of the said 2 children to the Respondent Wife, already taken into account the Appellant Husband’s submissions that the Respondent Wife had a history of mental issues. However, the evidence presented to the Court also showed that the Respondent Wife’s mental issues were due to past circumstances and that by the time of the AM hearings, the Respondent Wife was, in the Court’s assessment, able to take care of the said 2 children.

24     Therefore, the Court did not make any changes to its order regarding the award of care and control of the said 2 children to the Respondent Wife. Fortunately, the Court had also ordered that the Parties and the said 2 children were to attend counselling under the ‘Children-In-Between’ programme as directed by an agency to be appointed by the Ministry of Social and Family Development, to help both Parties work together in the best interests of the said 2 children. The Court hoped that this would allow the Parties to gain a better understanding of the effects of the divorce on the said 2 children.

25     Regarding the Appellant Husband’s access to the said 2 children, the Court realised at the first AM hearing, that both Parties had not sufficiently addressed the issue of access to the non-care and control parent. The Court noted for example, that neither Party had considered whether they would like access on their respective birthdays (the said 2 children’s and their own), Father’s Day and Mother’s Day. The Court therefore directed Counsel to provide further submissions on the kind of access each Party would like if they did not get care and control of the said 2 children.

26     Following the award of care and control of the said 2 children to the Respondent Wife, the Court then ensured that the Appellant Husband was given liberal unsupervised access covering weekdays, weekends, Father’s/Mother’s Day, respective birthdays, public holidays with exceptions for Chinese New Year and Christmas, and travel out of jurisdiction with the said 2 children during the said 2 children’s school holidays.

## Payment of maintenance for the said 2 children

27     The Court was informed that the Respondent Wife’s estimate of $1,500 for the monthly maintenance of the said 2 children was based on the Respondent Wife’s calculations that the total monthly expenses for the elder child was at $2,004 and $1,616 for the younger child = total expenses of $3,620 per month for both children.

28     The Respondent Wife had submitted that her take home income was $4,508 and that the Appellant Husband’s take home income was $2,189.16 per month. The Respondent Wife further submitted that, given the Parties’ earning capacity of 67% (Wife) vs 33% (Husband), therefore the Appellant Husband’s 33% share of $3,620 was $1,194.60 which the Respondent Wife had rounded up to $1,500 as she felt that the Appellant Husband’s income was not reflective of his earning potential, in view of the fact that he was a Degree holder and that she was only a Diploma holder.

29     The Appellant Husband submitted that the total monthly expenses for the elder child was $1,050.50 and $1,218.10 for the younger child = $2,268.60 per month for both children. The Appellant Husband also submitted that if he was awarded care and control, he wanted the Respondent Wife to pay the sum of $1,000 as monthly maintenance for the said 2 children, based on the income disparity between the Parties. He also wanted the Respondent Wife to reimburse him for 70% of the said 2 children’s medical and educational related expenses being hospitalisation, dental and medical, school fees, childcare, enrichment classes and year-end school expenses within 7 days of the production of receipts.

30     The Court was also informed that the Appellant Husband was currently paying the child care fees for the younger child and student care fees for the elder child, after deduction from the said 2 children’s Child Development Accounts (CDA). The Court was further informed that the Respondent Wife was paying for the elder child’s insurance premiums and that the Appellant Husband was paying for the younger child’s insurance premiums.

31     In making its assessment, the Court also noted that the Respondent Wife had submitted that she was willing to pay the sum of $900 per month for the maintenance of the said 2 children if she was not awarded care and control.

32     The Court was of the view that as the Appellant Husband was already paying for half of the said 2 children’s student care and child care fees that were not covered by their respective CDA, that this should continue. Thus, in the Court’s assessment, after taking into account that these fees were being paid by the Appellant Husband, a fair and reasonable sum to be paid by the Appellant Husband for the said 2 children’s monthly maintenance, was the sum of $800 per month.

33     The Court also assessed, based on the current income disparity between the Parties, that the Appellant Husband should pay for 1/3 of the said 2 children’s education related expenses and medical and dental expenses within 14 days of the production of receipts. In addition, the Court was of the view that the Appellant Husband’s prior consent was required before he was liable for payment of 1/3 of private medical treatment for the said 2 children.

34     Finally, the Court was of the view that both Parties should continue to each pay for the respective insurance premiums of the said 2 children, as that was currently being done.

## Payment of maintenance to the Respondent Wife

35     The Court was of the view that it was reasonable for the Appellant Husband to pay maintenance in the nominal sum of $1.00 per month for 2 years to the Respondent Wife. This was for a transient period to allow the Respondent Wife a little time to stabilise her finances after the divorce. In particular, the Court noted that the Respondent Wife had been awarded care and control of the said 2 children and that she might need financial assistance for their welfare, until she could stabilise her financial situation post the divorce.

## Division of the matrimonial property

36     The Parties agreed that the only matrimonial asset to be divided was the matrimonial property at xxx (“the MH”) which the Parties owned as Joint Tenants. The Court noted that this property had been bought at the purchase price of $xxx on xx August 2014. So the property was still under the Minimum Occupation Period (MOP) which would only expire on xx August 2019.

37     The Court was informed that each Party wanted the other Party’s rights, title and interests in the MH to be transferred to them, by way of transfer other than by way of sale.

38     The Respondent Wife offered to make partial refund to the Appellant Husband’s Central Provident Fund (CPF) account for taking over the MH within 3 months of the date of the AM Order and she would then continue to pay the outstanding housing loan and the costs of the transfer. In the event that such transfer could not take place, then the MH was to be surrendered to the Housing Development Board (HDB) and the proceeds to be divided at **62% to the Respondent Wife and 38% to the Appellant Husband** after taking into account an uplift of 5% in favour of the Respondent Wife as there was no division of the matrimonial assets. Each Party would then be responsible for their own CPF refunds.

39     The Appellant Husband’s Counsel submitted that the ratio for the division of the MH should be **57.5%** to the Appellant Husband and **42.5%** to the Respondent Wife. It was submitted that the MH be transferred to the Appellant Husband (other than by way of sale) within 12 months of the date of Final Judgement, upon the Appellant Husband paying 42.5% of the value of the MH (based on the purchase price of $371,500 after deducting the outstanding housing loan) to the Respondent Wife and for her to refund to her CPF account, all monies utilised by her for the purchase of the MH including accrued interests. The Appellant Husband would pay for the costs of the transfer and continue to pay the outstanding housing loan.

40     During the submissions at the AM hearings, it was agreed that the direct contributions (DC) were at 35% for the Respondent Wife and 65% for the Appellant Husband and that the weightage ratio should be equal namely, 50% for both DC and 50% for indirect financial and non-financial contributions (IC). The dispute was with regard to the percentage of each Parties’ respective IC.

41     The Respondent Wife’s Counsel submitted that the Respondent Wife should be awarded 75% for her IC and that the Appellant Husband should be awarded 25% for his IC. The Appellant Husband’s Counsel submitted that the Appellant Husband should be awarded 50% for his IC and that the Respondent Wife should also be awarded 50% for her IC.

42     In making its assessment on the division of the MH, the Court agreed with Counsel that the Respondent Wife had made 35% DC and the Appellant Husband had made 65% DC. The Court also agreed with Counsel that the weightage ratio should be 50:50 for DC and IC.

43     However, the Court was of the view that the Respondent Wife had made 70% IC and that the Appellant Husband’s corresponding IC was at 30%. The Court made this allotment based on the Court’s assessment that the Respondent Wife was the primary caregiver of the said 2 children.

44     The Court also took into account the fact that the Respondent Wife and the said 2 children were still living in the MH. As the Respondent Wife had been awarded care and control of the said 2 children, the Court was of the view that it was in the said 2 children’s best interests to minimise any further disruption in their lives and therefore rounded up the IC allotment in favour of the Respondent Wife.

45     Therefore, the Court’s final allotment was as follows:

46     As a first option, the Court provided for the transfer of the MH to the Respondent Wife. However, in the event that the Respondent Wife was not able to take over the MH and as the Appellant Husband had also offered to take over the MH, the Court also provided for the Appellant Husband to have the option to do so, following the expiry of the transfer period given to the Respondent Wife.

47     To assist in the transfers to either the Respondent Wife (as the 1st option) or to the Appellant Husband (as the 2nd option), the Court also proceeded to calculate the respective amounts that each Party would have to pay the other Party for the refunds to the other Party’s CPF accounts.

48     Finally, in the event that neither transfer could take place, the Court also provided for the 3rd option that the MH should be surrendered to the HDB and for the division of the net proceeds thereafter with the attendant orders.
