### District Judge Sheik Mustafa:

## Introduction

1       In this judgment, I shall refer to the plaintiff as “the Husband” and to the defendant as “the Wife”. They have a child from their marriage to whom I shall refer to as “PV”. The Wife has a child from her previous marriage to whom I shall refer to as “RK”.

2       The Husband commenced these divorce proceedings against the Wife. On the _\[xx\]_ October 2018, a district judge dissolved their marriage, to be finalised subsequently. The parties did not have an agreement on how to deal with the ancillary matters resulting from the divorce, so I heard the arguments on these. At the conclusion of the hearing of these ancillary matters, I ordered as follows -

> Children

> 1.     The Wife shall have sole custody care and control of RK. The Husband shall be allowed reasonable access to him.

> 2.     Both parties shall have joint custody of PV.

> 3.     Care and control of PV shall be shared as follows-

>> i.       The Wife shall have care and control of PV starting continuously from every Monday after school to Friday morning at the start of school, and in addition, on every other week it shall end on Saturday morning at 10am.

>> ii.       The Husband shall have care and control of PV starting continuously from Friday at the start of school or 10 am Saturday morning on every other week according to the above and shall end on every Monday after school.

>> iii.       In the event PV is on leave from school, the times and periods of PV’s care and control shall remain as if PV is still in school.

>> iv.       Each party shall be allowed access to PV at any reasonable time and in a reasonable manner when PV is in the other party’s care and control.

>> v.       Care and control of PV shall be equally shared between the parties on public holidays, school holidays, PV’s birthday, the parties’ birthdays, and any other time or period which the parties agree to.

> 4.     PV shall attend the Child-in-Between programme at a divorce Support Specialist Agency to provide support for her as she navigates the changes and adjust to the new arrangements.

> 5.     The Husband and the Wife shall attend suitable programmes at a Divorce Support Specialist Agency (DSSA) to support their co-parenting of PV for the longer term.

> 6.     The Husband, shall not by himself, his agents or his servants, bring PV out of Singapore without the prior written consent of the Wife or an Order of Court.

> 7.     The Wife, shall not by herself, her agents or her servants, bring PV out of Singapore without the prior written consent of the Husband or an Order of Court.

> Maintenance of RK

> 8.     The Husband shall not be liable to maintain RK.

> Maintenance of PV

> 9.     The Husband shall pay to the Wife monthly maintenance for the child PV in the sum of $1,110. This sum shall be paid by the Husband, in full, into the Wife’s bank account, no later than the last day of every calendar month, commencing in June 2020.

> 10.     The Husband shall also ensure that PV is at all times adequately insured for medical treatment and shall bear all the premiums in doing so. The Husband shall, upon demand, provide to the Wife all details and information of the said insurance.

> 11.     The Husband shall also be solely responsible for the settlement of PV’s school fees directly to the school or Ministry of Education.

> 12.     The Husband shall also be solely responsible for school books, uniforms, transport to and from school, and for stationery required by PV.

> 13.     The expenses of PV related to tuition, enrichment and extracurricular school activities shall be borne by both parties equally.

> 14.     Each party shall provide PV with adequate pocket money during the periods that PV is in their care and control.

> 15.     For the avoidance of doubt, in addition to the aforesaid, each party shall bear any other expenses related to PV incurred whilst PV is in their respective care and control.

> Division of the Matrimonial Home

> 16.     The parties shall sell their matrimonial property at _\[xx\]_ Bishan in the open market within 6 months of the date of Final Judgment to be issued herein. Both parties shall have joint conduct of the sale. If the Parties cannot agree on the valuation price of the matrimonial property, they shall jointly appoint a HDB accredited valuer to value the matrimonial property and shall jointly and equally pay for the expenses incurred.

> 17.     Proceeds of the sale, after settlement of the outstanding mortgage with interest, shall be divided between the parties, such that the Husband shall be entitled to receive 49.3% thereof and an additional sum of $6,830 being a refund to the Husband for maintenance that he had paid for the Wife’s child RK. The Husband is also entitled to receive 50.7% of the payments he makes towards the monthly mortgage after the date of this order. The Wife shall be entitled to receive the balance thereafter.

> 18.     Both parties shall equally bear all costs and expenses of the sale, including a commission to a housing agent.

> 19.     Both parties shall refund to their own CPF accounts from their respective shares of the proceeds of sale in accordance with CPF legislation and requirements. In the event of shortfall, the refunds to CPF accounts shall be considered partial refund and neither party is required to top up the difference.

> 20.     Each party shall sign or execute or indorse any documents required to effect the sale as aforesaid within 7 days of being given written notice to do so, in default of which the Registrar or Assistant Registrar of the Family Justice Court under section 31 of the Family Justice act 2014 shall be empowered to sign or execute or indorse all necessary documents as aforesaid on his/her behalf.

> Division of Other Assets

> 21.     The Husband is solely entitled to retain all other assets which are already in his name and ownership. The Wife shall not have any right or claim to them whatsoever.

> 22.     The Wife is solely entitled to retain all other assets which are already in her name and ownership. The Husband shall not have any right or claim to them whatsoever.

> Maintenance of the Wife

> 23.     The Husband is not liable for the maintenance of the Wife.

> Others

> 24.     There shall be liberty to apply.

> 25.     There is no order as to costs.

> 26.     For the avoidance of doubt, this Order supersedes the order of this Court MO _\[xxxx\]_/2018 dated _\[xx\]_ October 20_\[xx\]_ in MSS _\[xxxx\]_/2018. Each party shall be entitled to retain any rent already being collected from the date of this Order to the sale of the matrimonial home.

3       Both the Husband and the Wife appeal against my entire judgment. The following are the reasons for my judgment.

## Background facts

4       The couple married in December 2008 in Singapore. The marriage lasted for almost 10 years until it was dissolved by an interim judgment of this Court in October 2018. The couple had lived separately since January 2015.

5       The Husband is a 43-year-old Singapore citizen. The Wife is a 46-year-old Thai citizen and a permanent resident of Singapore. This is the Husband’s third marriage, and the Wife’s second.

6       PV is the only child of the marriage. PV is 9 years old and is a Singapore citizen. RK is a child from the Wife’s previous marriage. RK is 20 years old and is not a Singapore citizen nor a permanent resident. The Husband’s previous marriages did not produce any children.

7       Whilst these divorce proceedings were underway, the Wife applied for maintenance under section 69 of the Women’s Charter for herself, for PV and for RK. In October 2018 (9 days after the grant of the interim judgment), that maintenance case was heard, and the Court ordered the Husband to pay maintenance for the Wife as well as for PV and for RK.

8       The hearing of the ancillary matters subsequently came before me in November 2019. After hearing both sides, I ordered that a custody evaluation be carried out, and reported to me. The case adjourned. I received the report; I called parties back and gave my decision on all the outstanding issues.

## Custody of the children

### PV

9       PV is 9 years old. She is a Primary 4 student. The parents do not dispute the issue of joint custody. However, they dispute on her care and control.

10     The Husband argues that he has been PV’s main caregiver since PV was born. He claims that he intentionally took on a job which enabled him to work from home so that he would be able to stay home and care for PV. He claims that as he is Singaporean and intends to reside her permanently with PV, it is in PV’s best interest to be in his care and control because the Wife is not a Singaporean and is intent to relocate PV to Thailand. He more able to maintain PV financially as he has a stable job, compared to the Wife, who has not had a stable job. He claims to share an extremely close relationship with PV. He alleges that the Wife seeks to alienate him from PV.

11     The Wife argues that PV ought to be placed in her sole care and control. She claims this is because PV is a female child who has not attained puberty, and that she has been PV’s primary care giver since PV’s birth, whereas the Husband’s role is confined to schoolwork, tuition and enrichment. She claims that she stopped working at the Husband’s request in order to care for PV. She claims that both PV and RK share a close bond. Her counsel argues that it is trite law that the maternal bond an infant has with its Mother is undisputed and has been recognised by our Courts. The Wife claims that she is fully capable of meeting PV’s needs, and she has raised RK. She alleges that the Husband has a tendency to consume alcohol almost daily.

### Applicable principles

12     The primary law defining the custody care and control of children is found in section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act –

> “3.    Where in any proceedings before any Court the custody or upbringing of an infant or the administration of any property belonging to or held in trust for an infant or the application of the income thereof is in question, the Court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration and save in so far as such welfare otherwise requires the Father of an infant shall not be deemed to have any right superior to that of the Mother in respect of such custody, administration or application nor shall the Mother be deemed to have any claim superior to that of the Father.”

13     The law defining custody of children is also described by the Court of Appeal in the case of _CX v. CY_[^1] , that –

> “For the development of the law of custody, we deem it necessary to lay down a general definition detailing the scope of each order. Our observation is that in most custody cases, parties are simply concerned over which parent has care and control and access. Parties labour under the mistaken impression that if they are denied custody, they will be unable to see their child anymore and will lose all contact with the child. We regret to say that some family law practitioners further muddy the waters by failing to advise their clients adequately as to what “custody orders” actually entail. If parties are assured of their respective rights to care and control and access, we foresee lesser tension and acrimony in disputes over custody issues.

> Adopting this narrow definition of “custody”, it appears that there will be relatively few occasions where significant and longer-term decisions need to be made for the child. Hence, parties will seldom need to come together to make a joint decision even if joint or no custody orders were granted. We should add that it is an almost impossible task for us to lay down an exhaustive list of matters which will fall under the concept of residual custody. The line is not always clear as to what matters would be considered the important and longer-term decisions concerning the upbringing and welfare of a child. It suffices to say that decisions pertaining to religion, education and major healthcare issues would fall into such a category.

> In this day and age, we feel that the preferable position in the law of custody is that advocated by the Father, ie, to preserve the concept of joint parental responsibility, even if the parties may harbour some acrimony towards each other. Often, advocates of the Helen Ho position rely on the acrimonious relationship of the parties to argue that joint custody will be detrimental to the welfare of the child. However, they fail to appreciate the fact that some degree of acrimony is to be expected when parties are undergoing the stresses of a marital breakdown. As allegations of wrongdoings and breaches of fidelity can be hurtful, the time when the marriage breaks down may not be the best time to assess whether both parents can co-operate for the rest of the child’s life. We believe that the fear that parties cannot co-operate may be overstated. It is a quantum leap in logic to assume that the parties’ inability to co-operate during the period of divorce or custody proceedings equates to an inability to agree on the future long-term interests of the child.

> …

> Adopting the view that joint or no custody orders should be granted unless there are exceptional circumstances, we were of the opinion that the judge was not plainly wrong in granting joint custody, notwithstanding the allegations and counter-allegations made by each party.”

14     In _ZO v. ZP_[^2], the Court of Appeal added as follows:

> “… The input by both parents furnishes a balance that enhances the development of that child (or those children, as the case may be) until adulthood is reached. In contrast, the exclusion of one of the parents in this particular regard would – absent an exceptional reason – contribute towards a less balanced as well as less rounded development of the child (or children) concerned. Hence, the pronouncement made by the Court in _CX v CY_ that a joint (or no) custody order would henceforth be the norm rather than the exception. We could not agree more.”

15     Also relevant is section 125 of the Women’s Charter, which states that:

> (1)    The Court may at any time by order place a child in the custody, or in the care and control, of the child’s Father or Mother or (where there are exceptional circumstances making it undesirable that the child be entrusted to either parent) of any other relative of the child or of any organisation or association the objects of which include child welfare, or of any other suitable person.

> (2)    In deciding in whose custody a child should be placed, the paramount consideration shall be the welfare of the child and subject to this, the Court shall have regard –

>> (a)    to the wishes of the parents of the child; and

>> (b)    to the wishes of the child, where he or she is of an age to express an independent opinion.

16     On the issue of shared care and control of a child, I refer to _AQL v AQM_[^3], in which the High Court clarified the meaning of shared care and control:

> “\[8\]  ….In my opinion, an order for shared care and control means that the child spends time living with each parent, who then becomes the child’s primary caregiver for the duration that the child lives with him (or her). The right to make the day-to-day decisions on the upbringing of the child therefore rests with the parent the child is presently living with. In the context of shared care and control, it becomes meaningless to speak of ‘access’. This is because the child effectively has two homes and two primary caregivers.

> \[9\]    The practical effect of an order of shared care and control means that the child will spend roughly equal amounts of time (including overnight) with each parent. An order of shared care and control can take different forms depending on the circumstances.”

### Findings and conclusion

17     My findings are based on the evidence adduced before me, as well as the report of the custody evaluators assigned to the case.

18     PV resides with both parents in the matrimonial home, and has been doing so continuously since her birth. She shares a room with the Wife, but sleeps in the Husband’s room one night a week. The other room in the home is rented to tenants. The parents appear to have a functioning domestic schedule, and have clear roles for each of them regarding PV. The shared arrangements include fetching PV to and from the school bus, arranging her meals, and activities with her on weekends. The Wife attends to academic coaching every day between 5 to 7pm, and the Wife coaches PV on every subject except for her Mother Tongue (Hindi), which is the only subject that the Husband coaches her in. The Wife is also the main contact with the school for PV, but both parents attend parent-teacher meetings in school together. The Husband keeps in touch with school activities via a “Parent Gateway” app.

19     Both parties worry that the other will remove PV from Singapore. The Husband worries that the Wife will relocate to Thailand, whilst the Wife worries that the Husband will relocate to India. At this juncture, neither of the parents have stated that they intend to remove PV from Singapore, and neither has made any application in that regard. That being the case, there is no reason for me to decide on the issue of PV’s relocation.

20     Although both parties request for care and control of PV to be given to them, they both also offer liberal access to the other. There is no denial that both parents have a deep love for PV.

21     PV expressed her wishes to the custody evaluators that she wished for her parents to stop fighting, and to love each other, and reconcile with her stepbrother RK. I find that PV is well taken care of and securely attached to each parent. Both parents are familiar with PV’s needs and routines. Both parents do not have crippling differences in parenting approaches. I believe that, with a determination to do so, both parents can work together to co-parent PV successfully.

22     In considering what is in PV’s best interest, I took into account-

> a.     PV’s wishes,

> b.     The parents’ wishes,

> c.     The relationship of PV with the parents and significant others,

> d.     PV’s adjustment to her home, school and community, and

> e.     The mental and physical health of PV and the parents.

23     My decision of what is in the best interest of PV takes into account all the above relevant factors, and to decide for PV as she would make them if she were a rational agent who acts prudently, within the constraints of what morality requests.

24     I find that both parents are adequate parents of PV. I say so in the sense that they aim to provide PV with sufficiently good upbringing, one that equips her, when grown, to live and function independently in society, to the extent that this is possible at her age. I am satisfied, based on the reports of the custody evaluators, that the parents are able to parent PV in parallel to each other. I therefore find that the parents ought to share care and control of PV between them, instead of only one parent having it. PV is not too young to live in two homes. It is not in PV’s best interest to have her care and removed from one of her parents simply because the parents’ relationship ends, and that they will move on to live in new, separate homes in future. There is no indication that either parent is not able to care and control PV adequately. Therefore, I order PV to be in the care and control of each parent, such that PV will primarily be in the Wife’s care during weekdays and in the Husband’s care on weekends, except that the Wife’s care extends to Saturday every other week. This is to give PV some weekend time with the Wife. I also allow both parents to have access to PV at any time when she is in the other’s care. I find this arrangement to be in PV’s best interest and welfare. In addition, I order that PV’s care and control shall be equally shared between the parties on public holidays, school holidays, PV’s birthday, the parties’ birthdays, and any other time or period which the parties agree to.

25     To facilitate the transition, I order that PV shall attend the Child-in-Between programme at a Divorce Support Specialist Agency to provide support for her as she navigates the changes and adjust to the new arrangements. I also order that the Husband and the Wife shall attend suitable programmes at a Divorce Support Specialist Agency (DSSA) to support their co-parenting of PV for the longer term.

26     To address the issue of PV’s possible removal from Singapore, I forbade both parents from bringing her out of jurisdiction without the consent of each other, or without the Court’s permission.

### RK

27     RK is 20 years old. The Wife prays for sole custody care and control of him. The Husband submits that because he is not the biological child of the Husband, the Court needs to make no order on him.

28     It is not in dispute that RK lived with the parties. There were parenting issues with RK. This led to arguments between them, and the Husband fell out with RK. RK went to live with the Wife’s parents in Bangkok. RK ceased contact with the Husband. The Husband cancelled RK’s permanent residency. Until RK’s departure, it is clear that the Husband treated RK as a child of the family.

### Applicable principles

29     On whether this Court may make an order regarding RK, I refer to sections 123, 122 and 92 of the Women’s Charter –

> **123.**—(1)    Subject to this section, the Court shall not make final any judgment of divorce or nullity of marriage or grant a judgment of judicial separation unless the Court is satisfied as respects every child —

>> (a)    that arrangements have been made for the welfare of the child and that those arrangements are satisfactory or are the best that can be devised in the circumstances; or

>> (b)    that it is impracticable for the party or parties appearing before the Court to make any such arrangements.

30     The term “the child” in this provision is defined in section 122–

> **122**.    In this Chapter, wherever the context so requires, “child” means a child of the marriage as defined in section 92 but who is below the age of 21 years.

31     Section 92, in turn, provides as follows-

> **92**.    In this Part, unless the context otherwise requires —

>> “child of the marriage” means any child of the Husband and Wife, and includes any adopted child and any other child (whether or not a child of the Husband or of the Wife) who was a member of the family of the Husband and Wife at the time when they ceased to live together or at the time immediately preceding the institution of the proceedings, whichever first occurred; and for the purposes of this definition, the parties to a purported marriage that is void shall be deemed to be Husband and Wife.

### Findings and conclusion

32     RK falls into the definition of a child of the Wife who was a member of the family at the time immediately preceding the institution of these proceedings. He is therefore a child of the marriage under section 122.

33     Based on the positions taken the parties on this issue as well as the overall circumstances, I order RK to be in the sole custody care and control of the Wife, with reasonable access to the Husband. Under section 123, I am satisfied that arrangements have been made for his welfare, and that those arrangements are satisfactory or are the best that can be devised in the circumstances.

## Maintenance for the children

34     Having ordered that PV be placed in the shared care and control of both parents, and for RK be in the Wife’s care and control, I now turn to the issue of maintenance.

### Applicable principles on maintenance of children

35     Section 68 of the Women’s Charter provides as follows –

> **68**.    Except where an agreement or order of Court otherwise provides, it shall be the duty of a parent to maintain or contribute to the maintenance of his or her children, whether they are in his or her custody or the custody of any other person, and whether they are legitimate or illegitimate, either by providing them with such accommodation, clothing, food and education as may be reasonable having regard to his or her means and station in life or by paying the cost thereof.

36     In _AUA v ATZ_[^4], the Court of Appeal described the following principles in relation to the duties of biological parents to maintain their children under section 68 of the Charter.

> “Section 68 states that a parent’s duty is to provide what is ‘reasonable having regard to his or her means and station in life”. This is buttressed by s 69(4) of the Charter, which specifically directs the Court to have regard to “all the circumstances of the case”, including, among other things, the income and earning capacities of the Wife and child in deciding what sum to order in maintenance. Undergirding these provisions is the principle which we would, to borrow an expression from another area of the law, call the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities: both parents are equally responsible for providing for their children, but their precise obligations may differ depending on their means and capacities (see _TIT v TIU[^5]_). The Charter clearly contemplates that parents may contribute in different ways and to different extents in the discharge of their common duty to provide for their children.”

37     In _TIT v TIU_[^6] the High Court stated that the case of _ANJ v ANK_ accepted the principle that maintenance of children should be apportioned in accordance with, inter alia, the financial capabilities of the parents.

38     Section 69 of the Women’s Charter provides what the Court takes into account on this issue –

> (4)    The Court, when ordering maintenance for… a child under this section, shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the following matters:

>> (a)    the financial needs of the … child;

>> (b)    the income, earning capacity (if any), property and other financial resources of the … child;

>> (c)    any physical or mental disability of the … child;

>> (d)    the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage;

>> (e)    the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family;

>> (f)    the standard of living enjoyed —

>>> (iii)   by the child before a parent neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the child;

>> (g)    in the case of a child, the manner in which he was being, and in which the parties to the marriage expected him to be, educated or trained; and

>> (h)    the conduct of each of the parties to the marriage, if the conduct is such that it would in the opinion of the Court be inequitable to disregard it.

39     The duty to maintain a child accepted as a member of one’s family is provided for in section 70 of the Women’s Charter –

> 70.—(1)    Where a person has accepted a child who is not his child as a member of his family, it shall be his duty to maintain that child while he remains a child, so far as the Father or the Mother of the child fails to do so, and the Court may make such orders as may be necessary to ensure the welfare of the child.

> (2)    The duty imposed by subsection (1) shall cease if the child is taken away by his Father or Mother.

> (3)    Any sums expended by a person maintaining that child shall be recoverable as a debt from the Father or Mother of the child.

> (4)    An application for an order under subsection (1) may be made by —

>> (a)    any person who is a guardian or has the actual custody of the child;

>> (b)    where the child has attained the age of 21 years, the child himself;

>> (c)    where the child is below the age of 21 years, any of his siblings who has attained the age of 21 years; or

>> (d)    any person appointed by the Minister.

> (5)    Subsections (4) to (9) of section 69 shall apply, with the necessary modifications, to the making of an order under this section.

40     The issue of when the duty to maintain such a child ceases was dealt with by the Court of Appeal in _TDT v TDS_[^7]\-

> “\[118\]    In general, the various authorities are agreed that a non-parent’s duty to maintain a child may cease. However, what remains unsettled are the circumstances and manner in which cessation of the duty may take place….

> \[122\] We agree with the opinions of Woo J and Kan J in so far as they hold that where a non-parent has accepted a child as a member of his or her family, he or she may not thereafter renege on that acceptance by simply changing his or her mind …

> \[123\] Thus, where a child is taken away from the non-parent in the context of the breakdown of a marriage between the non-parent and the child’s parent, this would, in our view, cause the non-parent’s duty imposed by s 70(1) to cease. In our view, the duty imposed by s 70(1) on a non-parent would thus ordinarily cease when the interim judgment for divorce is granted. …

> \[124\] In the same way as an interim judgment for divorce puts the acquisition of matrimonial assets at an end, the interim judgment for divorce also puts an end to the parties’ union and their shared interest in co-operating for the well-being of the family. Whilst a parent continues to have a duty to maintain his or her biological children under s 68 of the Act whether or not such children are in the custody of that parent, a non-parent does not stand in the same position. In the usual case, the breakdown of a marriage would result in the non-parent losing custody of, and perhaps even access to, the child. It would not be fair to the non-parent to require him or her, in such circumstances to continue maintaining the child.”

41     With these legal guideposts in view, I make my findings on these issues.

### Findings and Conclusion

### PV

42     I find that the Husband has a take home income after taxes of $8,681.92. I find that the Wife has an income of $550 from rent collected. This income will end when the matrimonial home is sold, as I shall order presently, so I do not take it into account in my decision on this issue. The Wife has university qualifications and I find that she has the capacity to earn $3,000. Their relative shares of maintenance is thus 74% : 26%, and although I am not bound to allocate the burden of maintenance based purely on the parents’ relative incomes, in the circumstances of this case I find that this is a reasonable and fair figure to reflect the means of the parents. I find that PV’s expenses is $2,000 a month.

43     The Husband’s share of PV’s overall expenses is $1,480. I find that this is a fair and reasonable amount. However, in view of the shared care and control order that I have decided upon, the Husband will receive a discount of 25%. This leaves the Husband being liable to maintain PV at $1,110. I order the Husband to pay that sum every month to the Wife.

44     In addition to the $1,110 monthly, I order the Husband to bear other expenses of PV solely. He is to ensure that PV is at all times adequately insured for medical treatment and shall bear all the premiums in doing so. This is because PV is already covered under the Husband’s insurance. I also order the Husband to be solely responsible for the settlement of PV’s school fees directly to the school or Ministry of Education, and he shall also be solely responsible for school books, uniforms, transport to and from school, and for stationery required by PV. I make these additional orders on the Husband in view of his relatively higher earning power, the fact that he has been bearing these expenses thus far, and because these are irregular expenses.

45     As a reflection of both parents having shared care and control of PV, I order that PV’s expenses related to tuition, enrichment and extracurricular school activities shall be borne by both parents equally. Each parent shall provide PV with adequate pocket money during the periods that PV is in their care and control. For the avoidance of doubt, in addition to the aforesaid, each party shall bear any other expenses related to PV incurred whilst PV is in their respective care and control.

### RK

46     On 18 October 2018, in a hearing initiated by the Wife against the Husband under section 69 of the Women’s Charter for maintenance of herself, PV and RK, this Court ordered the Husband to pay, _inter alia_, a one-time payment of $370 as a reimbursement of payments made for RK, as well as for the following-

> i.     Costs of RK’s return air tickets from India to Singapore and corresponding domestic air tickets within India for RK to fly within India, from November 2018 to March 2019,

> ii.     Costs of RK’s one-way ticket from India to Singapore in May 2019,

> iii.     Costs of road transport for RK between his school and the airport in India,

> iv.     “Take care fees” for RK’s round trip in November 2018 to March 2019,

> v.     $300 a month as allowance for RK whilst he is in Singapore from November 2018 to March 2019,

> vi.     The outstanding balance of RK’s school fees when billed by his school, including medical expenses and other school expenses,

> vii.     RK’s mobile telephone bill,

> viii.     Providing medical insurance for RK.[^8]

47     The order came 9 days after the interim judgment. The Husband paid the expenses to the Wife. They amount to $6,830.

48     At the hearing before me, the Husband argues that he ought to be recompensed in the sum of $125,026. This is the sum that the Wife’s former Husband (RK’s Father) is alleged to have paid to the Wife as part of their divorce settlement. I make no finding or order on this. It is for the Husband to recover it as a debt from the Wife or RK’s Father in a different forum.

49     RK left for boarding school in India. He is no longer a permanent resident, and it is evident that he is not returning to the Husband. Since the before commencement of these proceedings, there has been no contact between him and the Husband.

50     I apply the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in _TDT v TDS_. Interim judgment in this case was decreed in October 2018. That interim judgment had put an end to the parties’ union and their shared interest in co-operating for the well-being of the family. I find that there is nothing in the facts or circumstances of this case that would make it fair to the Husband to require him to continue maintaining RK.

51     By extension, because the Husband had paid $6,830 to the Wife for the maintenance of RK after the interim judgment, I find that he is entitled to have it repaid to him as a debt from the Father or Mother of the child as provided for in section 70(3). I will apply this when I deal with the division of assets below.

52     To be clear, this does not mean that the Husband was not liable to comply with the 18 October 2018. My finding here is merely that the Husband is entitled to reclaim the sums he paid under it as a debt from the Wife.

## The Matrimonial Assets

53     There is one immovable property jointly owned by both the parties. It was acquired during the course of the marriage. It is an HDB flat. The parties do not agree on its value. I find that its value is $630,000. There is an outstanding mortgage on this property, and the amount is also not agreed. I find it to be $343,335.49. This leaves its nett value at $286,664.51.

54     Besides the matrimonial home, the parties have their CPF savings and bank accounts in their own individual names.

55     In addition, the Wife has a business, which I shall refer to as “PRCW”. I find the value of this business to be $20,000.

56     Also at issue is the Husband’s submission that his liabilities mentioned above ought to be deducted from the matrimonial asset pool, in the amount of $74,778.92. I do not accept this argument. However, I will address the issue again under the issue of his contributions later.

### Matrimonial Asset Pool

57     The total matrimonial asset pool therefore comprises of the following –

### Applicable principles on division of assets

58     As a start to my inquiry into dealing with the assets, I refer to section 112 of the Women’s Charter –

> **112.**—(1)    The Court shall have power, when granting or subsequent to the grant of a judgment of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage, to order the division between the parties of any matrimonial asset or the sale of any such asset and the division between the parties of the proceeds of the sale of any such asset in such proportions as the Court thinks just and equitable.

> (2)    It shall be the duty of the Court in deciding whether to exercise its powers under subsection (1) and, if so, in what manner, to have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the following matters:

>> (a)    the extent of the contributions made by each party in money, property or work towards acquiring, improving or maintaining the matrimonial assets;

>> (b)    any debt owing or obligation incurred or undertaken by either party for their joint benefit or for the benefit of any child of the marriage;

>> (c)    the needs of the children (if any) of the marriage;

>> (d)    the extent of the contributions made by each party to the welfare of the family, including looking after the home or caring for the family or any aged or infirm relative or dependant of either party;

>> (e)    any agreement between the parties with respect to the ownership and division of the matrimonial assets made in contemplation of divorce;

>> (f)    any period of rent-free occupation or other benefit enjoyed by one party in the matrimonial home to the exclusion of the other party;

>> (g)    the giving of assistance or support by one party to the other party (whether or not of a material kind), including the giving of assistance or support which aids the other party in the carrying on of his or her occupation or business; and

>> (h)    the matters referred to in section 114(1) so far as they are relevant.

59     The Court of Appeal in the case of _ANJ v ANK_[^9] outlined the judicial approach on division of matrimonial assets. Accordingly, the task at hand for me is to derive a ratio which represents the parties’ respective direct contributions towards the acquisition or improvement of matrimonial assets. Next, is for me to derive a second ratio, which represents the parties’ indirect financial and non-financial contributions towards the welfare of the family. I should then average the two ratios to derive each party’s overall contribution to the family. The “average percentage contribution” or “average ratio” are non-binding figures, and I would have to make adjustments as and when necessary. I bear these in mind, as well as that adjustments might also be necessary whenever the parties’ collective direct contribution do not carry the same weight as that of the parties’ collective indirect contribution.

60     Division of matrimonial assets is not an exact science, but neither is it an indefinable art. It is not mandatory for the Court to exercise its power of division in every single asset of the parties before it as long as it does not detract from the Court’s overall mandate to achieve a just and equitable division in the light of all of the circumstances of the case[^10].

### Application of the law to the facts

### Direct contributions

61     I find that the Husband paid $77,736.28 for renovations, in 2010 and 2015. This is supported by evidence.

62     I do not accept the Wife’s claim that she contributed to part of the renovation. There is no evidence to support this.

63     A table showing each party’s direct contributions to the total matrimonial asset pool is as follows-

64     As can be seen above, the relative proportions of direct contributions made by the parties is 87.5 : 12.5 in terms of the first ratio prescribed by _ANJ v ANK._

### Indirect contributions

65     The second ratio prescribed by _ANJ v ANK_ is that of each party’s indirect contributions to the well-being of the family, relative to that of the other.

66     Both parties lay contradictory versions of each other in this regard. What is clear, however, is that this is a middle-length marriage of 10 years with 2 children, in which I will treat the Wife as the principal home maker, and the Husband as the principal breadwinner.

67     The Husband argues that this marriage was only 6 years 1 month long before the separation in January 2015, and ought to be treated as such for the purpose of computing the length of the marriage in this regard. In this regard, I note that the parties had agreed in the amended statement of particulars, that in January 2015, the Husband moved out of the master bedroom and occupied the second bedroom in the matrimonial home; and that the parties no longer shared nor engaged in any marital relations, cooked or did the laundry for each other since then.

68     However, I find that this in itself does not mean that the parties ceased to make indirect contributions, in particular with regard to the extent of the contributions made by each party to the welfare of the family, including looking after the home or caring for the family or any aged or infirm relative or dependant of either party[^12]. In spite of the cessation of consortium between them, the parties continued to live under the same roof, they continued to take care of PV and RT, and together they managed the tenants – in other words, although they ceased to behave as a married couple towards each other, they continued to behave and function as parents and as common home owners. These have value as indirect contributions. Therefore, I treat the indirect contributions of the parties as continuing to accrue even after the parties separated in January 2015.

69     For most of the marriage, the Wife was the stay-at-home spouse. She was the principal caregiver of PV and RK. She did the housework. She managed the domestic worker when there was one[^13]. She was financially dependent on the Husband. She was and is the main academic mentor to PV. Clearly, she made substantial indirect contributions.

70     However, the Husband also contributed his share of indirect contributions. He paid for the domestic worker, and he paid the bills and expenses. At this point I add that I find that the Husband’s liabilities of $74,778.92 are not to be taken as having been incurred for the parties’ joint benefit nor for the benefit of the children, but primarily for his own. However, I do find that the 2 renovation loans he incurred totalling $7,500.62 ought to be taken as his contribution to the family.

71     I applied a broad brush approach to the issue. The totality of the evidence shows that there is an imbalance in indirect contributions to the household in favour of the Wife. I find the second ratio prescribed by _ANJ v_ ANK between the parties to be 33.5 : 66.5 in favour of the Wife.

### Average ratio and result

72     Thirdly, as prescribed by _ANJ v ANK_, I averaged the two ratios to derive each party’s overall contribution to the family. I disagree with the Husband’s submission that the ratio of direct to indirect contributions ought to be 70 : 30 in his favour. The cases cited by his learned counsel were for much shorter marriages than the present one.

73     In deciding the weight to be allocated to the direct against the indirect contributions, there are a few authorities I stand guided by. In _AYB v AYC_[^14] Belinda Ang Saw Ean, J, stated:

> “That said, direct and indirect, financial and non-financial contributions are all to be given equal weight and no single factor should be determinative of the outcome. This is clear in the statutory wording of Section 112 of the Women’s Charter which places no greater weight to any single type of contribution. In _Lim Choon Lai v Chew Kim Heng[^15]_ (“Lim Choon Lai”) at \[14(b)\], the Court of Appeal approved the dicta of Judith Prakash J in _Yow Mee Lan v Chen Kia Buan[^16]_ (“_Yow Mee Lan_”) and held that non-financial contributions can be just as important as financial contributions, depending on the circumstances of the case. In _NK v NL[^17]_ (“_NK v NL_”), the Court of Appeal approved of both _Lim Choon Lai_ and _Yow Mee Lan_, and went a step further by acknowledging that financial contributions are just one of the many factors to be taken into account, thus placing all the relevant factors, financial and non-financial, on equal footing. In addition, at \[34\] of _NK v NL_, the Court held that difficulty encountered in defining or measuring non-financial contributions should not be an obstacle to a just and equitable division of the assets”.

74     In _ANJ v ANK_[^18] , the Court of Appeal stated:

> “This Court has observed in _Lim Choon Lai v Chew Kim Heng_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 2 SLR(R) 260</span> at \[14\], that “\[a\]s for the non-financial contributions, they also play an important role, and depending on the circumstances of the case, they can be just as important.” We made similar remarks in _NK v NL_, that spousal contributions, regardless of whether it rests in the economic or homemaking spheres, are equally fundamental to the well-being of a marital partnership (at \[41\]). The strength in the above approach lies in the fact that it paves the way for the Court to put financial and non-financial contributions on an equal footing, as opposed to the traditional “uplift” approach that places direct financial contribution as the foremost consideration. We would underscore that s 112 of the WC does not give pre-eminence to any of the factors enumerated in s 112(2). We should, however, also point out that, for the very same reason, the approach proceeds on the basis that the collective indirect contribution made by both parties carries equal weight as the collective direct financial contribution made by both parties.”

75     However, in the same case, the Court of Appeal then went on to clarify that while the principle may apply in many cases, there may also be cases where it may not:

> “\[26\] This may well be the case in many instances, but there will also be instances where one component necessarily assumes greater importance than the other on the facts and correspondingly greater weight should be attached to that component as against the other. In cases that fall within the latter category, the Court should tweak or calibrate the “average ratio” in favour of one party to reflect what would be a just and equitable result in the circumstances of each case. To do so, the Court must engage in a _non-mathematical_ balancing exercise to determine the appropriate weight that should be accorded to the parties’ collective indirect contribution as against their collective direct contribution. We stress that the balancing exercise should be non-mathematical in nature, and should instead be based on the Court’s sense of what is fair and just. This is fact-sensitive inquiry where context is paramount. Put simply, the “average ratio” is a non-binding figure; it is meant to serve as an indicative guide to assist Courts in deciding what would be a just and equitable apportionment having regard to the factual nuances of each case.

> \[27\]  The circumstances that could shift the “average ratio” in favour of one party are diverse, and in our judgment, there are at least three (non-exhaustive) broad categories of factors that should be considered in attributing the appropriate weight to the parties’ collective direct contributions as against their indirect contributions:

>> (a)    The length of the marriage. Indirect contributions in general tend to feature more prominently in long marriages (_Tan Hwee Lee_ at \[85\]). Conversely, indirect contributions usually play a _de minimis_ role in short, childless marriages _(Ong Boon Huat Samuel v Chan Mei Lan Kristine[^19]_).

>> (b)    The size of the matrimonial assets and its constituents. If the pool of assets available for division is extraordinarily large and all of that was accrued by one party’s exceptional efforts, direct contributions are likely to command greater weight as against indirect contributions (_see Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo Nancy[^20]_ (“Yeo Chong Lin”)).

>> (c)    The extent and nature of indirect contributions made. Not all indirect contributions carry equal weight. For instance, the engagement of a domestic helper naturally reduces the burden of homemaking and caregiving responsibilities undertaken by the parties, and to that extent, the weight accorded to the parties’ collective indirect contributions in the homemaking and caregiving aspects may have to be correspondingly reduced. The Courts also tend to give weighty consideration to homemakers who have painstakingly raised children to adulthood, especially where such efforts have entailed significant career sacrifices on their part.”

76     Guided by the foregoing, I find that in the overall circumstances of the present case, the average ratio has not shifted, so the direct and indirect contributions have equal weight of 50:50. The result of the foregoing analysis results is shown in the table below.

### Conclusion on division of assets

77     First, I allocated the assets in sole names between the parties –

78     I order that each party is solely entitled to retain all these assets which are already in their sole names and ownership. The other shall not have any right or claim to them whatsoever.

79     On the flat, I recap that its net value is $286,664.51. The parties’ respective shares will be as follows.

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="14.7597719869707%"> <col width="20.0936482084691%"> <col width="21.0504885993485%"> <col width="21.7630293159609%"> <col width="22.3330618892508%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Party</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Share of total asset pool</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Already in own name</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Share of the flat</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Percentage of flat</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Husband</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$260,948.42</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$119,567.52</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$141,380.90</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">49.32%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Wife</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$170,371.28</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$25,084.68</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$145,286.60</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">50.68%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Total</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$431,319.71</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$144,652.20</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$286,667.50</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">100.001%</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

80     For ease of computation, I round off the shares to 49% and 51%.

81     I therefore order the flat to be sold, and after settlement of the mortgage, the parties shall be entitled to the net proceeds in these proportions. In addition, I also order that the Husband is entitled to have $6,830 added to his share. This is as a refund to him of the $6,830 that I have found him to be entitled to a refund from the Wife as stated above. Offsetting this sum at this juncture is in line with the spirit of a clean-break between the parties.

82     Since each party is entitled to roughly half of the flat’s value, I order them to bear the costs and expenses of the sale equally.

83     The result of the above exercise will leave the Husband with assets worth $267,778.42; and the Wife with assets worth $163,541.28. If the flat is successfully sold at the price of $630,000, after settling the mortgage with interest there ought to be a balance of $286,664.51.

84     The Husband will receive $140,465.61. With the maintenance refund of $6,830, he will receive a total of $147,295.61. This will not be enough to fully refund his CPF funds drawn for the property, with interest, which is $221,154.01. Therefore, I order that in the event of this shortfall, the refunds to his CPF account shall be considered a partial refund and neither party is required to top up the difference.

85     The Wife will receive $145,286.60. After the maintenance refund of $6,860, she will receive a total of $138,426.60. She will then have to refund her CPF plus interest, in the amount of $7,230.00 + $1,616.20 = $8,846.20. She will have a balance of $129,580.40.

86     The Husband has been paying for the monthly mortgage of the home, and is likely to be the one who will continue to do so until the flat’s disposal. Since the parties’ respective shares in the flat have been determined, I order that this expense be borne by the parties to reflect the respective shares. Therefore, I order that the Husband is also entitled to receive 50.7% of the payments he makes towards the monthly mortgage after the date of this order. The Wife shall be entitled to receive the balance thereafter.

## Maintenance for the Wife

87     The Wife prays for an order that the Husband maintain her with a monthly sum of $4,010. The Husband counters that she is not entitled to maintenance.

### Applicable principles on maintenance of a Wife

88     On the issue of maintenance for a former Wife, the Women’s Charter provides –

> **114.**—(1)    In determining the amount of any maintenance to be paid by a man to his Wife or former Wife, or by a woman to her incapacitated Husband or incapacitated former Husband, the Court shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the following matters:

>> (a)    the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;

>> (b)    the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;

>> (c)    the standard of living enjoyed by the family before the breakdown of the marriage;

>> (d)    the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage;

>> (e)    any physical or mental disability of either of the parties to the marriage;

>> (f)    the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family; and

>> (g)    in the case of proceedings for divorce or nullity of marriage, the value to either of the parties to the marriage of any benefit (for example, a pension) which, by reason of the dissolution or annulment of the marriage that party will lose the chance of acquiring.

> (2)    In exercising its powers under this section, the Court shall endeavour so to place the parties, so far as it is practicable and, having regard to their conduct, just to do so, in the financial position in which they would have been if the marriage had not broken down and each had properly discharged his or her financial obligations and responsibilities towards the other.

89     The Court of Appeal in _TNL v TNK_[^21] reiterated the following directive set out under section 114(1) of the Charter at \[62\]:

> “\[62\] … Ultimately, the award of maintenance is a multi-factorial inquiry which, pursuant to section 114(1) of the Women’s Charter requires the Court to have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the following matters listed in sub-sections 114(1)(a) to 114(1)(g)…”

90     In _ATE v ATD_[^22], the Court of Appeal stated the following :

> “\[33\] … What is clear (and this represents the present law on the matter) is that there is, as evinced by the very language of ss 112 and 114 themselves, an inter-relationship between both provisions and that this, as noted in, inter alia, _Foo Ah Yan_ (at \[26\] …), results in the power of the Court to order a division of matrimonial assets being the primary power, with the power to order maintenance being supplementary to the power to order a division of matrimonial assets (see also Leong at page 665).

>> 1.    Where the just and equitable division of their matrimonial assets yields to the former Wife a fair share of the surplus wealth of the marital partnership, the order of maintenance may be merely nominal.

>> 2.    Where it yields her substantial properties, the application for maintenance may even be dismissed.

>> 3.    It is only where there are not enough matrimonial assets to divide or the nature of the assets given to the economically weaker former spouse ‘cannot both provide a decent home for her (and the children, if as usual, they remain in her care) and produce some acceptable level of income, should the Court make an order for her maintenance’.

> Where the exercise of the power to divide matrimonial assets suffices to equalise the financial statuses of the former spouses, the Court may make no order of maintenance for the former Wife, a mere nominal order (to keep the Husband’s liability alive) or, at most, a modest order of maintenance. Where there is hardly any matrimonial asset to divide between the former spouses, the power to order maintenance for the former Wife can be expected to be exercised to its full extent because it must perform the role that is normally discharged by the power to divide matrimonial assets. Then there is the residual situation where, despite the exercise of the power to divide matrimonial assets, the homemaker and child carer remains financially disadvantaged by the roles discharged during the marriage. Here it is expected that the Court will also exercise the power to order maintenance for the former Wife to the extent needed to better equalise the financial statuses of the former spouses.”

91     In _TNL v TNK and another appeal and another matter_[^23], the Court of Appeal stated :

> “Additionally, as noted by the Judge, the Court’s power to order maintenance is supplementary to its power to order a division of matrimonial assets (_ATE v ATD[^24]_). Consequently, if, from the division of matrimonial assets, there is a sum which, if invested properly, would be sufficient to maintain the Wife, the award of maintenance should be no more than what is necessary to allow the Wife to, in the words of the Judge, “weather the transition of the divorce”.

92     The Court of Appeal in _Foo Ah Yan v Chiam Heng Chow_[^25] stated –

> “Consequently (and in accordance with this common sense holistic approach), our Courts have held, inter alia, that a former Wife must, where possible, exert reasonable efforts to secure gainful employment and contribute to preserve her pre-breakdown lifestyle…

> The Court must also consider the Husband’s financial ability to meet the maintenance order. Thus, although the Husband is prima facie obliged to maintain his former Wife beyond his retirement and up to the former Wife’s remarriage or the death of either party, the former Wife who has assets of her own should not expect a full subsidy for her lifestyle: see, for example, the Singapore High Court decision of _Yow Mee Lan v Chen Kai Buan[^26]_.”

93     On the issue of whether at least a nominal amount of maintenance ought to be awarded to the Wife, the guiding principles on this point were set out by the Court of Appeal in _ATE v ATD[^27]\-_

> “What seems to us to be clear is this: The Courts cannot – and ought not to – order nominal maintenance automatically or as a matter of course. As already alluded to above, the Court must examine closely all the facts and circumstances of the case before deciding whether or not to award nominal maintenance in order to preserve the Wife’s right to apply for maintenance in the future.

> Another (related) principle is that it will not suffice for the Wife to argue – without more – that she is entitled to an order of nominal maintenance simply because her situation might change in the future. Indeed, it has, in general, never been the duty of the Courts to compensate parties for the vicissitudes of life … More importantly, accepting such an argument would not only result in the blanket order of nominal maintenance in virtually every case, it would also result (in substance and effect) in making the Husband a general insurer of sorts. This would be wholly contrary to the very purpose of awarding maintenance to a former Wife in the first place – a point to which we will return shortly. For present purposes, it suffices to note that an application for nominal maintenance takes place in the context of a marriage that has already been terminated. In any event, it has never been – and ought not to be- the case that a party (let alone a former spouse) has a duty to be a general insurer vis-à-vis another party, Indeed, in order to provide for the vicissitudes of life, persons generally have recourse to the purchase of insurance policies.

> Quite apart from the two general (and related) principles just referred to, it would be inadvisable for this Court to lay down more specific principles simply because the factual permutations are enormous (from a human standpoint, possibly infinite). As already mentioned, the precise facts and circumstances of each case are of the first importance, and this is itself a (further, and third) general principle that is so obvious, yet vital. That having been said, we have also mentioned that the law in this particular sphere will undoubtedly evolve over time. Although it is not the case that specific factual matrices will necessarily lead to general principles being formulated, the entire process of legal development is far more nuanced and interactional in nature and, in this regard, it is entirely possible that embedded within specific fact situations are general rules and principles which could be developed over time. Indeed the facts of the present case illustrate this.

> Before we consider the facts of the present case, there is another general principle that can, in our view, guide the Courts. It is, arguably at least, as important as, if not more important than, the three general principles already set out above. And, it is this: The Court ought always to bear in mind the underlying rationale and purpose for the award of maintenance generally to former wives. As this Court stated in _Foo Ah Yan v Chiam Heng Chow_[^28], the overarching principle embodied in s 114(2) is that of financial preservation, which requires the Wife to be maintained at a standard that is, to a reasonable extent, commensurate with the standard of living she had enjoyed during the marriage – but we also cautioned that s 114(2) had to be applied in a “common sense holistic manner that takes into account the new realities that flow from the breakdown of marriage…”

> …What, in effect, the Wife was requesting … was that the Husband be a general insurer for the Wife for an indefinite period of time. The preservation of the Wife’s right to claim maintenance in the event any misfortune should befall her appeared to be the sole basis for her request and indeed, the Judge’s decision to award nominal maintenance to the Wife. …this cannot – and ought not to – be the case. The future is impossible to predict and that something untoward could happen is always possible. However, that is– in and of itself – an insufficient reason for granting nominal maintenance, bearing in mind that this is an obligation that might be visited on the Husband concerned at any time in the future even though the marriage has already been terminated. Hence something more must be shown on the facts and circumstances of the particular case to justify the Court awarding the Wife concerned nominal maintenance.

### Findings and Conclusion

94     With the foregoing in mind, I take into account the following relevant facts –

> a.     The Wife is 46 years old, and she is a freelance art teacher. She does not appear to have any disability.

> b.     She has a sole proprietorship wherein she is a freelance art teacher and a gallery facilitator. There is no indication that she would lose that capacity any time soon.

> c.     Although it is argued by the Wife that her business is a failure, I find that she must have the experience and ability to obtain some sort of employment, including other, less specialised, types of jobs.

> d.     There will be contribution of maintenance for PV from the Husband. There is already adequate provision for RK, who is attaining adulthood soon. In any event, it is not just nor fair for the weight of maintaining RK to be borne by the Husband indirectly through maintaining the Wife.

> e.     After the division of the matrimonial assets, the Wife will be left with a substantial share the total matrimonial asset pool worth $129,580.40 after refund into her CPF. This is much more than what she contributed financially to it. This may not be enough to acquire a new abode for herself, but it ought to be sizeable enough to greatly reduce the amount of mortgage she would need to obtain for it. With a modest income, the Wife should be able to obtain the financing and be able to afford to support herself. I find that this removes her need for maintenance from the Husband.

95     Based on these facts, I find that the Wife ought not be entitled to maintenance from the Husband.

96     Further, applying section 114 as well as the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in _ATE v ATD_, I find that the circumstances of the present case are not so exceptional such that a nominal maintenance needs to be preserved for the Wife.

97     For these reasons, I order that there be no maintenance payable by the Husband to the Wife.

### Costs

98     Both parties appeal on my making no order as to costs. On this regard, it suffices for me to state that the Wife is legally aided and is not liable to any order for costs[^29].
