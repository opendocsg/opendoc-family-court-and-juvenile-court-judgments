Family Law – Ancillary Matters – section 112 & 127 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353)

10 December 2019

### District Judge Cheryl Koh:

## A.    Introduction

1       These are the ancillary matters arising out of a divorce involving (a) the division of matrimonial assets; (b) custody, care and control of the children; and (c) maintenance for the children. Parties have agreed that there shall be no maintenance for the plaintiff wife (the “**Wife**”).

2       On 27 August 2019, I made the following orders:

> (a)     each party to retain all their own assets;

> (b)     parties to have joint custody and joint care and control of the children; and

> (c)     each party to maintain the children when the children are with each of them.

> In addition, the defendant husband (the “**Husband**”) shall pay the Wife the sum of $2,100.00 per month for the children's expenses borne by the Wife. The Husband shall pay for the daughter’s swimming lessons, her year-end educational expenses and the son’s existing insurance directly.

> The Wife shall pay for the son's year end educational expenses and the daughter's existing insurance directly.

> For past maintenance, the Husband shall pay the Wife a sum of $8,000.00 in instalments of $500.00 per month, on top of current maintenance.

3       The Wife has appealed against the part of my decision on the division of matrimonial assets and maintenance of the children. There is no appeal by the Husband.

## B.    Background facts

4       Parties were married on 07 October 2006. The Wife left the matrimonial home in April 2017 and moved in with her boyfriend, and took the children with her in June 2017. The Wife commenced divorce proceedings in November 2017. Interim Judgment was granted on 07 May 2018. The marriage therefore lasted about 12 years.

5       There are two (2) children to the marriage, one girl currently aged 10 years old and studying in primary four, and one boy currently aged 6 years old (the “**Children**”). The boy suffers from intellectual disability and autism.

6       The Husband is 46 years old and works as an Accounts Director. The Wife is 43 years old and works as a Partner Success Manager. It is undisputed that the Wife is a higher income earner than the Husband.

7       After the Wife commenced divorce proceedings, the Husband sought orders on interim arrangements on the Children and for urgent access to the Children for March school holidays. On 9 March 2018, the Family Court ordered for parties to split March school holidays equally. On 17 May 2018, the Family Court further ordered for the Husband to have weekly access to the Children, with school holidays and public holidays to be split equally. The Wife appealed and on 10 July 2018, the High Court commissioned a Social Welfare Report and a psychological report for the son in light of his special needs. In the meantime, the Husband filed contempt proceedings against the Wife for denial of access. After the reports were ready and upon reviewing the same, I made the orders for joint custody and joint care and control of the Children. As there is no appeal by the Wife on these orders, I need not further elaborate on these orders in this judgment. I shall focus on only the two issues under appeal, namely, the division of matrimonial assets and maintenance for the Children.

8       The Wife also filed a MSS application for interim maintenance for the Children under section 69 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353) in March 2018. Parties eventually agreed for the MSS to be heard together with the ancillary matters, hence I backdated maintenance for the Children to March 2018. This shall be elaborated upon below.

9       The affidavits and submissions filed by the parties are as follows:

> (a)     the Wife’s 1st Affidavit of Assets and Means (“**AOM**”) filed on 26 July 2018;

> (b)     the Wife’s 2nd AOM filed on 16 April 2019;

> (c)     the Wife’s 3rd AOM filed on 03 May 2019;

> (d)     the Husband’s 1st AOM filed on 24 July 2018;

> (e)     the Husband’s 2nd AOM filed on 12 April 2019;

> (f)     the Husband’s 3rd AOM filed on 03 May 2019;

> (g)     the Wife’s Submissions filed on 03 July 2019; and

> (h)     the Husband’s Submissions filed on 03 July 2019.

## C.    Grounds of Decision

10     Both parties do not dispute that the structured approach in the Court of Appeal’s decision of _ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span> (“_ANJ_”) should be applied in the present case. The following steps will thus be undertaken in this judgment:

> (a)     delineating the matrimonial pool;

> (b)     ascribing a ratio that represents each party’s direct financial contributions relative to the other party;

> (c)     deciding a ratio that represents each party’s indirect contributions;

> (d)     deriving each party’s average percentage contributions; and

> (e)     further adjustments to the weightage of the direct and indirect contributions, or to shift the average ratio, if any.

### Value of the matrimonial pool

11     The value of the matrimonial pool is largely not disputed, and I find the value to be about $2.5 million, as follows:

### Direct contributions to the matrimonial pool

12     As I have wholly accepted the Wife’s calculations of direct contributions to the matrimonial pool to be about 56:44 in favour of the Wife[^1], and there is no appeal by the Husband, I will not elaborate any further in this regard.

### Indirect contributions

13     The Wife argued that indirect contributions ought to be 75:25 in her favour. She argued that as she was the higher income earner throughout the marriage, and the Husband was also unemployed for about a year, she had paid for most of the family expenses including the Children’s expenses. She also paid for the furniture and fittings of the HDB and condominium units. As the Husband was religious, he chose to spend his money on huge amounts of religious donations. The Wife and her mother initially did the household chores, but the Wife eventually engaged a maid so that the Wife’s mother could focus on the Children.

14     The Husband argued that direct contributions should be 50:50. He had made numerous cash transfers to the Wife to enable her to pay the downpayment for the condominium unit. He also paid for all repairs and maintenance for the HDB and condominium units. He paid for the car expenses, including the monthly instalments, petrol, cashcard, parking and servicing. Parties had agreed that the Wife would pursue her career as she could earn much more than the Husband, and she thus had a high-flying job with long hours and frequent travelling. The Husband took a backseat in his career and stepped up to take care of the Children. He was the one who ferried the Children to and from school and their activities, and did their activities with them.

15     I found parties’ indirect contributions to the marriage to be about equal. Whilst the Husband contributed towards asset acquisition, he also paid for various family expenses such as for the car, repairs and maintenance of the properties. The Husband paid the sum of $6,400.00 to the Wife every month to pay for the condominium’s mortgage as well as for family expenses, such sum being partially derived from the HDB that was rented out at $3,200 to $3,300.00 per month and the balance being from the Husband’s income. Even if the Wife bore a large portion of the family expenses, it would be a natural consequence of her being a much higher income earner than the Husband. As for indirect non-financial contributions, both parties worked and were assisted by the Wife’s mother and the domestic helper in caregiving of the Children. It is not disputed that the Wife had to work longer hours and travel frequently for her job, hence the Husband was the one who cared for the Children when she was away. Even when the Wife was around in Singapore, the Husband remained a highly involved parent. This is also evident in the Social Welfare Report, which confirm that the Children are extremely attached to the Husband, notwithstanding that they spent much lesser time with him under the interim orders. This was also a significant reason in me awarding joint care and control of the Children to both parties.

### Overall ratio

16     This means that applying the structured approach in _ANJ_, the final ratio would be 53:47 in favour of the Wife. Both counsel agree that equal weightage should be given to direct and indirect contributions:

17     The Husband’s share of the matrimonial pool is thus about $1,221,124.80 (47% of $2,598,402.01). After deducting his sole assets of $1,194,424.90, the Wife should transfer about $26,000.00 to the Husband. However, this is a _de minimis_ sum compared to the matrimonial pool of $2.5 million, and in light that the Husband had enjoyed exclusive occupation of the condominium unit, I ordered each party to retain their own assets.

### Maintenance of the Children

18     The Wife sought the monthly sum of $6,000.00 as maintenance for the Children. The Husband offered the monthly sum of $1,500.00. I ordered for each party to maintain the Children when the Children are with each of them. I also ordered the Husband to pay the Wife the monthly sum of $2,100.00 as his contribution for the Children’s expenses borne by the Wife. This is on top of the Husband paying for the daughter’s swimming lessons ($240.00 per month), the daughter’s year end educational expenses and the son’s existing insurance ($700.00 per month) directly. This brings his total maintenance obligations to about $3,000.00 (excluding the sums he expends on the Children when they are under his joint care and control).

19     I find that the daughter’s expenses to be about $2,000.00, calculated as follows:

21     This means that the Children’s reasonable expenses come up to a total of $6,779.39 (excluding insurance).

22     The Wife argued that the Husband should bear the Children’s expenses equally, whilst the Husband argued that he should bear only about one-third of the same. It is not disputed that parties are able to manage their own expenses with their income (although both claim to be highly stretched in terms of their expenditure); it is a question of whether the Husband should bear half or one-third of the Children’s expenses. I take into account parties’ monthly income proportion, which is about $26,000.00 for the Wife and $13,000.00 for the Husband ($10,000.00 net monthly income plus $3,000.00 average monthly commission), translating to an income ratio of about 2:1 in favour of the Wife. Whilst income proportion is not determinative of how parties should share children’s expenses, in this case, given the large disparity in income and that the Wife has in any event been bearing a larger share of the family expenses, I find it reasonable for the Husband to bear about 35% of the Children’s reasonable expenses ($2,100.00 + $240.00=$2,340.00). Whilst the Wife claimed that she would have to service the monthly mortgage of the condominium unit whilst the Husband could live with his parents and rent out the HDB unit, it is borne in mind that the Wife could also continue living with her boyfriend at his rented apartment and rent out the condominium unit. In addition, the Husband would pay for the daughter’s year-end educational expenses and the son’s insurance ($700.00 per month). I also backdated the maintenance to March 2018 (shortfall of about $500.00 per month x 16 months).
