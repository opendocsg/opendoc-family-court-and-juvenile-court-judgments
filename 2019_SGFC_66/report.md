Variation of Maintenance - Material Change in circumstances

26 June 2019

### District Judge Wendy Yu:

## Introduction

1       The parties were divorced and the ancillary order was granted on 8 August 2012. The parties have two children, namely the elder child R1 and the younger child, R2 (“R2”). The Appellant Husband was the Defendant in the divorce, while the Respondent Wife was the Plaintiff. For ease of reference, the Appellant shall be referred to as the Defendant, while the Respondent shall be referred to as the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff is an Intellectual Property clerk[^1] while the Defendant is a lawyer.

2       One of the orders made by consent in the ancillary order dated 8 August 2012 was for the maintenance of the children of the marriage, as follows:

_“By consent, the Defendant shall pay $1,000 per month for the minor child of the Marriage, and $800.00 per month for the elder child of the Marriage, R1 with effect from 1st September 2012 and thereafter on the 1st day of each subsequent month. The payments are to be made in the Plaintiff’s POSB savings account no. xxx”._

3       The Plaintiff filed an application on 30 October 2018 for the following orders, essentially to vary the above maintenance order for R2:

“(1)     Paragraph 5(b) of the Ancillary Matters Order dated 8 August 2012 shall be varied such that the Defendant pays $2,500.00 per month for the younger child, namely R2 (“R2”) with effect from 1 July 2018 and thereafter on the 1st day of each calendar month.

(2)     The Defendant to bear the full cost of R2’s laptop.

(3)     The Defendant to bear 65% of all future and additional expenses incurred relating to R2’s education at the Nanyang Technological University within 7 days upon proof of expenditure furnished by the Plaintiff.

(4)     The Defendant to reimburse the Plaintiff 65% of all expenses incurred since July 2018 related to R2’s enrolment into the Nanyang Technological University within 7 days upon proof of expenditure furnished by the Plaintiff.

(5)     The payments are to be made into the Plaintiff’s POSB savings account no. xxx.

(6)     The Defendant shall pay costs of the application.

(7)     Such further and other orders as the Honourable Court thinks fit or just.

## The Plaintiff’s Submissions

4       The Plaintiff’s application is based on a material change in circumstances arising from R2 being enrolled successfully into Nanyang Technological University on 1 June 2018 to read Computer Science and has commenced her 4-year degree course on 27 July 2018.[^2] At the time the AM order was made, R2 was 13 years old.[^3] It has been more than 6 years since then. R2 is currently 19 years old.[^4]

5       The Plaintiff has submitted that the monthly maintenance of $2500 per month sought is very reasonable, with the Defendant’s share of the expenses at $2500 per month being in the proportion of 65%. The Plaintiff has further submitted that this is not unreasonable given that in the AM proceedings, the agreed monthly contribution of $1000 by the Defendant would be about 71.7% of the expenses. [^5]

6       The Plaintiff has also cited several cases, including the High Court decision of **_TBC v TBD (“TBC”)_** to support her position that whilst the starting point should be that the parents bear the financial burden equally, this is not an inflexible rule[^6].

7       The Plaintiff further added that even though the Defendant has claimed that his income has dropped, his employment and income earning circumstances have actually not changed in any substantive way. [^7] The Plaintiff has also highlighted to the Court that the Defendant’s position against R2 staying at the hostel is unacceptable as R2 lives with the Plaintiff at Tampines while NTU is in the West and R2 would spend too much time travelling if she did not live in the hostel. [^8]

## The Defendant’s Submissions

8       The Defendant has submitted that the material change must be material adverse change of circumstances before the Court can vary the maintenance order[^9], and that there has been a change in circumstances but no material adverse change of circumstances[^10].

9       The Defendant has also submitted that the maintenance sum of $2500 claimed is excessive and that the maintenance sum of $1000 that was originally agreed at the ancillaries should remain[^11] as the expenses, including that of staying in hostel should not exceed $21,000 per year. The Defendant has stated that $770 per month would be a reasonable sum of maintenance for R2[^12]. The Defendant further contended that there is no necessity for R2 to be staying in a hostel, and even if it was necessary for her to do so, it should not be a single room with attached toilet, but a twin sharing room[^13]. The Defendant also disagreed that he should bear the costs of purchase of R2’s laptop, as the laptop is still working.

10     The Defendant highlighted to the Court the case of **_APE v APF \[SGHC\] SGHC 17_** where Tan Siong Thye J has stated that “it is trite that maintenance is ordered in order to meet the reasonable needs of the child and if the child’s lifestyle is overly extravagant, the husband should not be made to bear the costs of it”[^14].

11     The Defendant has also argued that R2 should supplement the maintenance given to her by doing part time work[^15].

12     On the issue of proportion, the Defendant has submitted that he should be contributing 50% of the fees as both the parties have an equal responsibility to maintain a child of the marriage and that in circumstances where the parties are able to pay from their disposable income equally, then the court should order contribution in equal shares[^16].

## Orders Made

13     After hearing the parties, I made the following orders:

“1.    Paragraph 5(b) of the Ancillary Matters Order dated 8 August 2012 is varied such that the Defendant pays SGD 1300 per month for the younger child, namely R2 (“R2”) with effect from 1 July 2018 and thereafter on the 1st day of each calendar month.

2.    The Defendant shall bear 65% of the cost of R2’s laptop.

3.    The Defendant shall bear 65% of the R2’s Nanyang Technological University (“NTU”) Tuition Fees, NTU Hostel Fees, School Supplies and all future and additional expenses reasonable incurred relating to R2’s education at NTU within 7 days upon proof of expenditure furnished by the Plaintiff.

4.    The Defendant shall reimburse the Plaintiff’s 65% of all expenses incurred since July 2018 related to R2’s enrolment into the NTU within 7 days upon proof of expenditure furnished by the Plaintiff.

5.    The payments are to be made into the Plaintiff’s POSB savings account no. xxx.

6.    The Defendant shall pay to the Plaintiff costs fixed at SGD 800.”

## Appeal

14     The Defendant has appealed against the entire order. I will now give my reasons for my decision.

## The Law

15     Section 118 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353) provides:

_“The Court may at any time vary or rescind any subsisting order for maintenance, whether secured or unsecured, on the application of the person in whose favour or of the person against whom the order was made, or, in respect of secured maintenance, of the legal personal representatives of the latter, where it is satisfied that the order was based on any misrepresentation or mistake of fact or where there has been any material change in the circumstances.”_

## Material Change in circumstances

16     I had to determine if there were material change in circumstances which would warrant a variation in the maintenance sum. The needs of R2 has clearly changed since the AM Order was made in August 2012, and the change in circumstances would warrant a variation of the maintenance sum. The needs of a secondary school student would be different from that of an undergraduate undergoing local tertiary education, especially in terms of the expenses and amount of school fees payable.

17     Both parties do not dispute that parents have a duty to maintain their children and this includes children above 21 that are receiving instruction at an educational establishment (see Sections 68 and 69(5)(_c_) of the Woman’s Charter).

18     However, what is in dispute is the apportionment of proportion. I bore in mind the _dicta_ of the Honourable Justice Kan Ting Chiu in **_TBC v TBD (2015) SGHC 130_** that the starting point should be that parents bear the financial burden equally and one parent’s burden should not be increased just because the other parent is less well off, that there should be in fact not be a norm that parents should contribute in proportion to their means.

19     In the recent Court of Appeal case in **_BPC v BPB (2019) SGCA 03_**, the Husband had submitted that the Judge at the court below should have ordered the parties to each bear half of all expenses incurred for the children because both parties have a joint and equal obligation to maintain their children, under Section 68 of the Charter. The Court of Appeal had expressly disagreed with this submission at \[111\] that Section 68 mandates such a result and opined as follows:

_“Although parents do indeed share an equal responsibility for looking after their children, this ought not to necessarily translate into each parent bearing an equal share of the burden to provide maintenance for their children. This is because the extent of the duty to provide maintenance rests on a host of factors as enumerated by s 114(1) of the Charter:_

(_a_)     _the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;_

(_b_)     _the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;_

(_c_)     _the standard of living enjoyed by the family before the breakdown of the marriage;_

(_d_)     _the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage;_

(_e_)     _any physical or mental disability of either of the parties to the marriage;_

(_f_)     _the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family; and_

(_g_)     _in the case of proceedings for divorce or nullity of marriage, the value to either of the parties to the marriage of any benefit (for example, a pension) which, by reason of the dissolution or annulment of the marriage that party will lose the chance of acquiring._

_It was therefore open to the Judge to consider other factors, including the relative circumstances of both parties, in making the maintenance orders.”_

20     In deciding that proportion of child maintenance payable by each parent, it was open to the Court to consider other factors, including the relative circumstances of both parties, such as the income and earning capacity of both parties.

#### Income, Earning capacity and Financial Obligations of both parties

21     The Defendant has declared his current annual income to be $90,000[^17], which works out to a monthly income of $7500. This amount has been disputed by the Plaintiff, who has argued that the Defendant has “downplayed” his earnings as the Defendant was earning an annual sum of $145,000 to $154,000 during the divorce proceedings[^18]. The Plaintiff has also highlighted with evidence that the Defendant is currently a Director of 4 companies and a shareholder of a few companies as well.[^19] The Defendant has since remarried and his current wife is a lawyer whom the Defendant has stated is not dependent on him[^20]. The Defendant has also declared his monthly expenses to be in the sum of $6376 per month (which includes the monthly sum of $1000 of current maintenance for R2[^21]). The Defendant has stated in his affidavit that he does not have sufficient funds in his CPF Ordinary Account[^22] and that any contribution to R2’s school fees will be in cash.

22     The Plaintiff has exhibited her Notice of Assessment in her 2nd Affidavit, and stated that her annual gross salary for 2018 is $44,789.16[^23], which works out to be approximately $3732 per month.

23     Considering the earning capacity, current income and financial obligations of both parties, I accepted the Plaintiff’s submission that it is reasonable for the Defendant to bear 65% of R2’s expenses and fees.

### What is a reasonable sum for maintenance?

24     In setting out the expenses of the R2, I would like to highlight Justice Debbie Ong’s views in **_UEB v UEC_** at \[13\]

_“While it is a very useful practice to determine whether each item in the list of expenses submitted by the Wife is a reasonable one, one should not be overly mesmerised by the approach of reaching a maintenance sum only by totalling up every item of expense as if it were a legal requirement. The law provides that the court shall take into account various factors in deciding the maintenance award. The law does not require that every specific item of expense be proved by receipts or assessed on specific values, as if on a reimbursement exercise. More exceptional expenses though, such as certain medical needs and costs, ought to be supported by evidence. A child’s needs and expenses may also fluctuate from month to month; similarly; household expenses may fluctuate over time. Setting out regularly specific expenses nevertheless enables the other party and the court to assess broadly whether the expenses are reasonable.”_

I have therefore set out expenses of the R2 (excluding the school fees and school related expenses)- on what is reasonable as stated by the Plaintiff, what is the reasonable sum as stated by the Defendant, and the reasonable sum that the Court is to have assessed broadly:

25     In determining the above figures, I took into consideration the standard of living of R2 and the sum of $1000 that was previously agreed for her maintenance at the ancillary proceedings, as well as the station in life of her parents. I noted that in the affidavit of means filed at the ancillaries stage, that the Plaintiff had already indicated claims back then for holidays of $2400 per year, as well as birthday parties with expenses of $240 per year[^26]. I therefore found it reasonable to order the Defendant to pay the Plaintiff a monthly sum of $1300 for the maintenance of R2, which works out to be about 65% of the sum of $1964.85. This figure of $1964.85 has been assessed broadly as this figure may fluctuate month to month. The sum ordered is with effect from July 2018, which is from the date when R2 started her university course.

26     For R2’s share of the common/household expenses, instead of allowing the amount of $885.27 that the Plaintiff is requesting for, I have reduced it to $500 as R2 will spend most of her time at the hostel instead of staying at home with the Plaintiff. It is fair that her share of the expenses be reduced, although I note that certain expenses would have been incurred regardless of whether R2 would be at home, such as the helper’s expenses.

27     For R2’s NTU Computer Science Tuition fees and education related expenses (including NTU hostel fees, school supplies), I am of the view that the Defendant should bear 65% of such expenses, while the Plaintiff shoulders 35% of such expenses. This proportion will also apply to the purchase of R2’s laptop, which I am of the view is a school related expense. I had separated the school related expenses from the other expenses so that it will be easier for parties to calculate what is payable after taking into consideration whether R2 obtains the MOE Bursary or not.

28     On the issue of costs, I have ordered the Defendant to pay the Plaintiff costs of $800 as the Plaintiff had partially succeeded in her application although she did not get the full amount that she had requested for.

29     It is unfortunate that a mother had to resort to filing an application against her ex-husband to make a claim for their undergraduate daughter. This application could possibly have been avoided if the relationship between the Defendant and R2 had not been so estranged. I would like to urge the father and daughter to make an effort to communicate with each other and to restore their relationship to prevent any need for future applications to the Court.
