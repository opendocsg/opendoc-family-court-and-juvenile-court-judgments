Ancillary matter, division of assets, child maintenance and adverse inference

2 September 2019

### District Judge Toh Wee San:

## Introduction

1       This was a case concerning the division of matrimonial assets and custody of two children from the dissolution of a 5 year-old marriage. I heard parties and issued my orders, as attached and accompanied by written brief reasons. The defendant husband (H) filed an appeal against my orders. I explain my decision further below.

2       Parties registered their marriage on xx June 2013 and have two children from their union. When I heard their case, the two sons were aged about 4 and 3 years old. The plaintiff wife (W) stopped working for almost 3 years (from April 2015 to January 2018) and was a full time home-maker. Parties bought a HDB flat in September 2016. W and the children moved into the said flat in January 2017 but H did not do so. The marriage broke down shortly after and W moved out of the flat with the two boys in April 2017. H moved into the flat instead. W commenced divorce in October 2017. An interim judgement which dissolves the marriage on each other’s unreasonable conduct was obtained in August 2018.

3       The issues in dispute were the parties’ indirect contribution ratio, adverse inference against H’s non-disclosure, asset divisional outcomes, parties’ joint custody over, H’s access rights to and H’s monthly maintenance for the children.

#### Issue 1:   Parties’ indirect contribution ratio

4       Parties agreed with the direct financial contributions made by each side and the nett value of the property. However, they did not agree on each other’s indirect contribution ratio. W’s case was she was the primary caregiver for the children from day one. Even though she was a housewife for some years, this was requested by H and she also paid for a lot of things including the maid’s salary for 3 months. She asserted that H “abandoned” the family by not moving in with them, had another woman and was a violent person. She informed that she applied for a personal protection order against H but withdrew it. W asked to be awarded 90% for her indirect contributions.

5       H disputed W’s case. H’s case was he did not ask W to stop working as he could not afford to do so. Instead, W was the one who insisted on becoming a home-maker and expected H to maintain her and the children. H did but faced a lot of difficulties as a sole income earner. H did not move in with W and the children as he felt that W looked down on him. He was hurt by her words and actions. H also said that he did not take the helper away but the helper approached him for help from W’s abuse. Subsequently H lost his job due to their marital problems and was unable to support W and their children. However H agreed to give S$500 per month for his children even though he was not earning much. He struggled to keep up with the payments but subsequently stopped paying, because W did not allow him to see the children. H submitted that he was there for his children when he was staying with them and the marriage had not broken down. After that, his access was blocked by W.

6       Applying the broad brush approach, I attributed 60% to W as her indirect contributions. Both sides did not dispute that she was the primary caregiver for the two children from day one for a period of about 4 years. W also worked before the children came and after the children came, for about 8 months before interim judgment (IJ) was received. After the marriage broke down, she was taking care of and financially supporting the children on her own (with some financial contributions from H and H said that W blocked his access to the children) for about 16 months until IJ was obtained.

#### Issue 2:   Adverse inference against H’s non-disclosure

7       W’s case was H owns a car, jewelleries, investment and other assets which he has failed to disclose and W produced some evidence of her allegation. W also successfully applied for a Court order for H to disclose his employment contract, pay-slips for the past 6 months, evidence of his properties (if any) and their values, vehicles and their values, insurance policies and their values, CDP statements for the prescribed periods, monthly bank statements and related documents, CPF statements and jewelleries, documents relating to rental incomes and alleged termination in employment. H did not comply with the Court order.

8       H failed to comply with the Court order and he did not address these in his affidavits. During the hearing, H appeared in person and he explained that he had given all he had to his lawyer. I was not persuaded by his explanations, in the absence of any corroborative or supporting evidence. H also offered replies to the assertions by W but these are not admissible in evidence as they were not in his reply affidavits. I was also of the view that it would be unfair to allow H to provide further evidence at this stage of the proceeding.

9       While W had no conclusive evidence of H’s undisclosed assets, I opined that H’s non-compliance with the Court order was sufficient to attract an adverse inference in accordance with the applicable law[^1]. W also argued that she would be the care and control parent for the two children for the next almost 20 years. In view of the above, W wanted another 15% of the divisional outcome to be accorded to her. After considering, I was not persuaded that 15% was an appropriate figure. I awarded an additional 10% to W for drawing an adverse inference, the needs of the children[^2] and H and his family’s occupation of the flat since W moved out in April 2017. As detailed below, W was awarded as the care parent for the two young children. It was very likely that W would shoulder this duty for many more years to come. There was also evidence that H offered the flat for rental though it was inconclusive if he succeeded.

#### Issue 3:   Asset divisional outcome

10     Other than the above, there was no disagreement regarding the direct contributions from each side for both group of assets below.

11     Applying the relevant laws[^3], the outcome of the division is as follows.

> W should receive $7,500[^4] in order for each party to retain assets in each sole name and possession. As H has more CPF monies than W, I ordered H to transfer $3,750 from each of his CPF medi-save and special accounts to W’s respective CPF accounts and this will equalise each party’s CPF monies.

#### Issue 4:   Joint custody over children

12     W asked for sole custody but was not successful. H asked for joint custody. Applying the relevant laws[^5], I ordered joint custody for both parties but W shall decide for schooling issues, if parties cannot agree after discussion. I opined that this condition was necessary as it was possible for parties to differ and disagree. Hence for schooling issues (such as the choice of a primary school), it would be in the best interest of the child for W to be the final decision maker in the event that there is disagreement after parties have discussed, since W is the care parent.

#### Issue 5:   H’s access rights to and monthly maintenance for the children

13     W asked for care and control (CC) of the children with supervised access over both children to H. W argued that the children are only 4 and 3 years old and had not been in touch with H since January 2017 and the children would need some transition (such as supervised access) to be comfortable with H. W also asked for monthly maintenance of $600 per child, total of $1,200 per month for both children. W asked for an attachment of earnings as H had defaulted payments before.

14     H disagreed that he needed supervised access for his first child. He argued that the first child was familiar with him. He could not afford $600 per child per month and offered $300 per month for both children. As mentioned above, he agreed to $500 interim monthly maintenance but defaulted on payments as W did not allow him to see the children.

15     Applying the relevant laws[^6], I ordered that W shall have CC over the children, with reasonable access to H. For a start I ordered H to have supervised access to both children. I was aware of H’s strong view that he could handle the older child without external supervision. How-ever bearing in mind that the children were of tender ages (both are below 5 years old), had been apart from H for at least 2 years and parties were still very acrimonious, I felt that a short transitional arrangement where access was supervised by a trained person would be more prudent and beneficial for everyone. I also ordered parties to be counselled and this would usually be carried out by the same person conducting the supervised access. An access and counselling report would be furnished to the Court in due course. This would allow the Court to monitor the progress of the matter before letting go and parties can also benefit from the advice and support of the counsellor.

16     As for payment of maintenance, I opined that both parents have an equal duty to maintain their children and ordered them to do so equally. The children’s expenses provided by W were on the high side and hence moderated. I ordered H to maintain both children at $850 per month. I opined that he had such a capability. I was not persuaded that H could not afford this or that his permanent earning capacity was $1,200 per month for one part-time work. I note that he had declared an income of about $2,200 for working in two part-time jobs in his first affidavit of assets and means. More-ever his CPF contributions showed that he was working for more than two sources in some instances. As for his affidavit assertion that he had to look after his mother and therefore couldn’t take on a full time work, there were no supportive evidence to explain why this was the case. I anticipated that this money issue would come up again, as the children were very young and parties had a long way more to go. Hence I also directed both parties to exchange their IRAS statements annually.

17     W asked for costs but I was not persuaded since neither side had gotten what they asked for squarely. More-ever parties had a long way more to go. I hope that they can put the unhappy past behind and cooperate harmoniously in future, for their children. In conclusion, I ordered each side to bear their own costs.

* * *

[^1]: It is established case law that parties are under duty to make full and frank disclosure. Failure to do so entitles the Court to draw adverse inference that the party is of substantial means. One option is to increase the share of the asset division belonging to the prejudiced party.

[^2]: Section 112(2)(c) Woman’s Charter (WC)

[^3]: Section 112 of the WC empowers the Courts to order division of matrimonial assets in such proportions as the Court thinks is just and equitable and sets out the list of matters to be considered under subsection (2). It is also established case law that in determining how assets are to be divided, the “broad-brush” approach is preferred. In ANJ v ANK (2015) SGCA 34, the Court of Appeal (CA) introduced the structured methodology to assess the division of matrimonial assets, namely each of the direct and indirect contributions would be attributed as a “ratio” and averaged. If there was a need to give more weight to the direct or indirect contributions, the Court would have the discretion to do so.

[^4]: This is 48% – 15.4% = 32.6% of the total value in respect of parties’ assets in each sole names.

[^5]: Section 3 Guardianship of Infants Act and section 125 WC – welfare of the child is of paramount consideration.

[^6]: Ditto. Section 127 WC.
