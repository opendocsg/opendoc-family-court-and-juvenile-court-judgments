2       After considering the reports put up by the Probation Officer, fully weighing the mitigation pleas made by parents and the offender, and hearing the views of the panel of advisers[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1), I made a Juvenile Rehabilitation Centre order placing the offender at the Singapore Boys’ Home for 24 months. The father of the offender, desiring that he be placed on probation instead, has filed an appeal. These Grounds explain the reasons for the order made.

## GENERAL PRINCIPLES

3       The Youth Court operates with the welfare and best interests of the juvenile as its first and paramount consideration[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2). Keenly aware that the offenders before the court are still very young and are capable of being moulded, the court’s primary concern is not that of calibrating and meting out punishment proportionate to the offence. Neither is deterrence a foremost consideration, especially general deterrence. Instead, the court focuses primarily on finding rehabilitative measures and solutions that are most workable for the juvenile, given the facts and circumstances of the case.

4       Such an approach cannot mean that a less intrusive or less severe option such as probation is always chosen, as though every juvenile would be entitled to it by virtue of his youthfulness. The court may generally prefer a parsimonious approach, favouring less intrusive and less severe options wherever possible[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3). But it has ultimately to ensure that the order chosen would be one that best serves the interests of the young offender before it. More rigorous orders will have to be imposed where they are needed.

## SUITABILITY FOR PROBATION

5       The above was the exact approach taken in this case. Full consideration was first given as to whether the probation regime was viable before other options were weighed. I concluded that the option was unworkable and would not serve the offender’s interests. The factors considered in deciding whether probation was appropriate can be grouped under two main headings: the _offender’s_ characteristics and suitability for probation, and the availability of sufficient _family_ support and supervision. Weaknesses in just one area can sometimes be compensated for by sufficient strengths in the other, making probation still viable. However, deep concerns and deficiencies in both would almost certainly mean that probation is not in the offender’s best interests.

6       Before I go on to address these two areas, I found it very helpful, in the course of deciding on the order to be made, to view the sequence of events in their chronological order. Hence I first set out the chronology of events in this case. Reference will be made to the three reports put up by the Probation Officer (“PO”). I will refer to the initial Probation Report as the “PSR”, the first Supplementary Report dated 9/1/19 as “SR1”, and the second Supplementary Report dated 18/2/19 as “SR2”.

## The offender’s personal characteristics

7       I now deal with the offender’s personal characteristics and his suitability for probation. Here, I took into account a number of considerations.

#### His offending behaviour was deep-seated with clear signs of recalcitrance

8       This was not a case involving a one-off or isolated offending, or offending that was out of character for the individual. There were a total of 16 offences and they were spread across a 17-month period: from 29/3/17 to 26/10/18. Some of the offences were relatively minor, but it was clear that not all of them were.

9       In addition, the number of charges did not tell the whole story. By his own admission, his thefts, for instance, started at age 13. After that, he had committed so many thefts that there was no way he could recall the number of times he had stolen[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5). His involvement in drugs was also anything but fleeting and superficial. All these were clear indications of a rather deep-seated offending behaviour.

10     There were other worrying indications of his degree of persistence in offending. It was after he had pleaded guilty to the first batch of offences on 16/8/18 that he committed a further drug consumption offence[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6) on 31/8/18 and a voluntarily causing hurt offence[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7) on 10/9/18. This was most unusual. By the time of the offences, he was already undergoing interviews with the PO in relation to the earlier offences and was awaiting court orders thereto. He should know better than to commit other offences.

11     Unfortunately, this was not all. There would be a third set of offences. He committed the additional drug consumption[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8) and possession[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9) offences around 26/10/18. This was just five days after he had been charged in court for his earlier drug consumption. He was still awaiting orders for his first two sets of offences. All this further showed an unusual measure of recalcitrance in his offending.

#### His drug offending

12     Of all the offences he committed, his drug offending was of the greatest concern. By his own admission, he had an early onset, in 2017 and at the age of 14. Before long, he had consumed drugs to the point where his own father made a choice in April 2018 to report him to the authorities. That did nothing to deter him. In October 2018, the parents had to admit him to hospital when they suspected he was ‘high’ on drugs and behaving erratically[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10). Again, in November 2018, when they parents had him assessed by a psychologist, he had to be prescribed with medication to manage his substance dependence[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11).

13     The offender obviously knew how to obtain drugs[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12). He also said he, despite his young age, had the financial means to do so[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13). With his numerous thefts despite being from a relatively well-to-do family and evidently being given sufficient pocket money for his sustenance, I draw the inference that he could have stolen to obtain drugs as well. Added to what I have already mentioned concerning his repeated drug offending despite being already charged, everything pointed to a rather entrenched problem with drugs.

#### Poor attitude toward offending and low amenability toward probationary supervision

14     While the persistence in offending would show the absence of true remorse, it was also necessary to look for other signs as to the offender’s attitude towards his offending. In this regard, what an offender professes and promises are not ignored. But the presence or absence of other signs would also be important, such as indications of insight into and honesty over his offending behaviour, clear and authentic display of remorse and the ability to make changes.

15     In this unusual case where the matter remained uncompleted for some seven months, there was every opportunity for the offender to display or develop a positive attitude over his offending. Unfortunately, none of that was evident or sustained. While the school reported initial improvement after the offender was charged in court[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14), that quickly fizzled out when he committed further offences in school[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15). The PO did earlier report that he expressed regret for his offences, but he also “displayed minimal insight”[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16) as to the seriousness of his offences. Even in subsequent reports, all the PO was able to report was that he “expressed some remorse”[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17) while at the same time wanting probation on his own terms.

16     I looked for other signs indicating amenability to probationary supervision. Unfortunately, the evidence pointed the other way. Despite having consumed drugs during the very period of time he was undergoing interviews with the PO, he was plainly dishonest in insisting to the PO that he had stopped consuming drugs since April 2018[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18). He told the PO that he knew there would be “dire consequences” on his future if he did not change, and claimed that he had stopped contact with negative peers[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19). But his re-offences made it clear how untrue and empty those words were. Beyond that, there was a history of defiance toward authority and many infringements in school, resulting in repeated disciplinary actions having to be taken[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20). I could find nothing indicating the ability to benefit from probationary supervision.

#### His ADHD condition

17     I noted that the parents had the offender assessed by a private psychologist on 22/11/18, who diagnosed him with Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (“ADHD”). I did not find that this fact made probation any more appropriate.

18     Firstly, I accept that an ADHD condition can possibly have a bearing on a person’s choices and bear a causal link to the offending. But that, by itself, is insufficient. For the diagnosis to be given weight, it ought to be accompanied by indications as to the extent to which it had a bearing on the actual offences committed, supported by reasons. In this case, no expert opinion to this effect was brought to my attention[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21). All that existed was a bare diagnosis with nothing to indicate how much bearing the condition had on the offender’s choices at the time of the offences.

19     Secondly, from the manner in which the offences were committed, there were signs that the ADHD condition, if it existed, did not contribute significantly to his offending. In this regard, the facts of his drug consumption offences were especially telling. In YAC-900849-18, he said he was “feeling down” about the court matters, and purchased drugs from Geylang for his consumption[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22). There was nothing to indicate that he was already there in Geylang and suddenly decided to acquire drugs. It was more likely that he had to travel there and had to seek out the contact so as to acquire the drugs. These were acts that indicated the exercise of a deliberate and conscious choice to commit the offence.

20     Similarly, on the occasion where YAC-901018-18 was committed, he consumed drugs at home when his friends came to celebrate his birthday. Going by what he told the PO, he committed the offences despite having already been charged because he had calculated that, being at home, he would not be caught. His possession offence came about because he also made a decision not to use up all the drugs immediately, but to keep some for consumption over the next few days[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23). These were clear signs of intentionality, indicating that he was directed primarily by his own conscious choices.

21     Thirdly, I noted that the offender was already examined by a psychiatrist in 13/8/18, who assessed the offender to have anger management issues and prescribed medication for that. But the psychiatrist made no mention of ADHD[\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24). There was some uncertainty, in the circumstances, as to the validity of the ADHD diagnosis itself, quite apart from its bearing on the choice to offend.

22     I concluded that hardly any weight ought to be attached to the ADHD diagnosis in late 2018. Even as regards the weight that should be attached thereto, it had to be considered in light of all the other circumstances. I determined that it would not change my overall conclusion that probation remained unworkable.

#### Summary

23     Despite how much the offender desired probation instead of a more severe order, all the above considerations pointed inexorably to this option not being in his interest, and none of them indicated that probation was truly workable. I go on to the second main area of consideration.

## Family support and supervision

24     The level of support the family is able to provide is an important consideration because, unlike a Juvenile Rehabilitation Centre order, probationary supervision takes place substantially in the offender’s natural setting[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25). The PO is never going to be able to supervise the offender closely on a day-to-day basis. For probation to viable, there must be a workable level of support and supervision at home. While this would be so even for adult offenders, it is all the more true when dealing with juveniles. All things being equal, the younger the offender/probationer, the more critical family support is.

25     The offender is fortunate to have parents who not only adopted him as a new-born and but also do genuinely care for him. I noted that the father was able to make tough but painful decisions, such as when he reported the offender to the authorities twice: once in April 2018 and again just after 22/10/18[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26). Beyond that, however, I am afraid I had to conclude that they have not shown themselves able to provide a level of supervision and structure necessary for the offender, especially given the severity of his offending behaviour.

26     I saw in the PSR a long history of minimal involvement on the part of the parents in the offender’s supervision. This was consistently reported both by XXX, where the offender completed primary school and also by XXX, where he had his secondary school education. Both schools noted how parents were always preoccupied with work and were not actively involved in his supervision[\[note: 27\]](#Ftn_27).

27     The PO observed the same. She reported on how the parents may have initially tried to return home earlier and to supervise the offender. But they were not able to sustain the changes and reverted to being home at 9 or 10pm[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28). Even before me on 26/2/19 when orders were finally to be made, the father himself expressed much the same. He pointed out how they were still working very long hours to explain why they did not respond to the Probation officer’s attempts to contact them.

28     One might have hoped that given the parents’ limitations, they would appreciate and support the efforts of the school authorities when they step in to discipline and bring correction to the offender. This was not to be. Their lack of direct and active supervision over the offender was unfortunately combined with indulgent protectiveness and antagonistic defensiveness over him. They repeatedly sided with the offender when the school imposed disciplinary measures on him. When XXX suspended him following his assault on his classmates, the parents had him defy the suspension[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29). Even after the school had expelled him in September 2018, the parents could not bring themselves to accept this, making only limited attempts to place him in another school[\[note: 30\]](#Ftn_30).

29     While mindful of how the father was willing to report the offender to the authorities, I noted that there were signs of protectiveness from the state authorities as well. I have mentioned how in October 2018, the parents admitted the offender to hospital when they noticed him behaving erratically and suspected that he was ‘high’ on drugs. This took place while the PO was very much in contact with the family over the PSR, but the parents intentionally withheld this from the PO. The PO came to know of this only when separately informed by the hospital[\[note: 31\]](#Ftn_31).

30     Not only did the parents fail to supervise and discipline him properly themselves, they had also shielded him when the authorities sought to do so. In the process and over time, their permissiveness and protectiveness may have unintentionally reinforced in him the confidence that he can be protected from the consequences of his actions. I am concerned that in insisting that he be placed on probation despite the severity of his risk issues and offending, they were still doing the same, potentially further reinforcing attitudes in the offender that are dangerous for him.

31     The parents’ style of parenting over the years had produced in the offender what is not easily reversed. On their own part, their permissiveness and abject lack of supervision is also not something that is easily changed. This would call for work-related changes and personal changes of a scale I had no grounds to be confident the parents could now make or sustain. Furthermore, even if they gained sufficient insight over shortcomings in their parenting, and were now to put in much time and effort to correct them, that may not suffice.

32     The offender is already well into his teenage years, and the parents come against a long-settled parent-child relational pattern. To what extent can an endeavour _at this stage_ to set firm boundaries, to insist on compliance with parental requirements, and to enforce strict discipline at home gain traction, when none of this existed for years? I had every reason to be deeply concerned, especially when there is no strong relational base to support this, and when the pattern and nature of acute offending in this case makes the risks of breakdown so serious.

33     I had exercised some restraint in what I express over these matters, as I do not wish for all this to bring discouragement to the parents. Regardless of the orders made, the parents’ parenting journey is far from over. I certainly hope for them to continue in that journey with necessary changes being made. However, my judgment would remain that the level of parental supervision would not be sufficient, at this point in time, for a probation order to be workable and to serve the offender’s best interest.

## CONCLUSION

34     I mentioned that of the two areas for consideration, the _offender’s_ characteristics and suitability for probation, and the availability of sufficient _family_ support and supervision, weaknesses in just one area can possibly be compensated for by sufficient strengths in the other. In this case, I found that neither consideration favoured probation and in neither consideration were there sufficient strengths to compensate for the grave concerns in relation to the other.

35     While I carefully assessed the facts and circumstances of the case in determining if probation would be appropriate, I also attached due weight to the recommendations of the PO. This was necessary, especially in light of the High Court’s comments in _A Karthik v PP_ , at \[78\]-\[79\] to the effect that the court should ordinarily be slow to depart from the recommendations of the PO. In this case, although the PO had earlier recommended probation in the PSR, she maintained in both SR1 and SR2 that probation was unsuitable following the re-offences and following further assessment of the extent of parental supervision. I add, for completeness, that the advisers who sat with me also agreed with the PO’s views and recommendations.

36     I concluded that an order placing the offender in a Juvenile Rehabilitation Centre for 24 months at the Singapore Boys’ Home was necessary and made the order accordingly. I emphasise that the order is a rehabilitative one. The regime does not focus on punishment, incapacitation or deterrence. Opportunities will be available for education and counselling. Home leave and even day-release is often granted within the duration of the orders.
