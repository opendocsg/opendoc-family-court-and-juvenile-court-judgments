Family law – Appointment of child psychiatrist

25 November 2019

### District Judge Lo Wai Ping:

1       The parties were married in 2008 and have 2 children, a son and a daughter who are presently 9 and 6 years of age (“**Children**”). Interim judgment for divorce (“**Interim Judgment**”) was entered on 6 April 2017. The plaintiff is the father (“**Father**”) and the defendant, the mother (“**Mother**”).

2       On 23 April 2019, by way of summons, FC/SUM 1412/2019, the Father sought leave of Court for the Children to be examined and/or assessed by a child psychiatrist in relation to the custody, care and control and access issues in the ancillaries (“the **Application**”).

3       The Application was filed pursuant to Rule 35(1) of the Family Justice Rules which provides as follows:

> “35(1)    Where a child is a party to or a subject of any action or proceedings, or where any action or proceedings involve the welfare or custody of a child, a party must not, without the leave of the Court, cause the child to be examined or assessed by any registered medical practitioner, psychologist, counsellor, social worker or mental health professional for the purpose of preparing expert evidence for use in those proceedings.”

4       After hearing the parties, I dismissed the Application. However, on my own motion, I appointed a Child Representative to represent the best interests of the Children. I now set out the reasons for dismissing the Application.

## Background Facts

5       At the time of the hearing, the Father was in the pub business whilst the Mother was a flight stewardess. Parties separated in December 2015 and divorce proceedings were commenced in 2016. The Children have been residing with the Mother in her parents’ home (“**GP Home**”) since December 2015. The maternal grandparents help look after the Children. Pursuant to an order of Court dated 3 August 2016 (“**First Order**”), the Mother was granted interim care and control of the Children with access to the Father.

6       On 6 June 2017, a Court order was recorded which varied the Father’s terms of access to the Children in the First Order amongst other things (“**June 2017 Order**”). Under the terms of the June 2017 Order, the parties continued to have joint custody of the Children, with the Mother having interim care and control of the Children. As for the Father, he was granted more access to the Children in the interim. These included the following:

> (a)     access during school term on every Wednesday (after school to 9pm) with overnight access every Friday (after school) to Saturday 6pm;

> (b)     access to the Children for half of all the school holidays (with the right to take the Children for vacation overseas during his school holiday access); and

> (c)     access on alternate public holidays, and

> (d)     access during the Chinese New Year period and also on special birthdays such as the Children’s birthdays and the Father’s birthday.

7       On 15 November 2017, the Father filed summons, FC/SUM 3973/2017, to vary the care and control terms set out in the June 2017 Order. The Father wanted essentially to have interim care and control of the son pending the ancillaries. His application was triggered by an incident on 9 November 2017 involving the son and the son’s maternal uncle, **U** (that is, his wife’s brother) who was then residing also at the GP Home. The Father’s variation application was not granted.

8       The Mother continued to have interim care and control of the son. However, on 20 December 2017, a social welfare report (“**the SW Report**”) was ordered by the Court for the ancillaries given the disputes and concerns over the Children’s welfare and their care and living arrangements. The son was then about 8 years of age whilst the daughter was about 5 years old. In April 2018, the SW Report was completed and provided to the Court.

9       But, the parties were not ready in 2018 for the hearing of the ancillaries. In 2018, in relation to the matrimonial assets, there were several applications for discovery and interrogatories taken out by the parties (their affidavits of assets and means had been filed sometime in September 2017). The divorce proceedings were also stayed by the Court in 2018 for about 1 month for parties to take out proceedings in the High Court. This was due to claims made by the Mother in her affidavits that the Father and parties had beneficial interest in certain immovable properties registered in the name of third parties. Eventually, after the filing of various affidavits (ordered affidavits as well as voluntary ones) by both parties and some delay in compliance with timelines given for the filing of their second round of affidavits, the parties finally filed and exchanged their reply affidavits for the ancillary matters in April 2019 and the hearing of the ancillaries was scheduled on 8 May 2019.

## The Application

10     The Father filed the Application in question on 23 April 2019. This was about 2 weeks before the 8 May 2019 hearing date for the ancillaries. For the Application, the Father filed one affidavit. The Mother did not file any affidavit in reply but for the hearing she filed notices of her intention to refer to affidavits filed in the divorce proceedings. The Application was fixed for hearing on 8 May 2019.

11     However, a few days before the scheduled hearing, the Father filed a recusal application against me from hearing any matters relating to the divorce between the parties (“**Recusal Application**”) and subsequently, he also filed an application to restrain the Mother’s legal counsel, **C** and the law firm of the said counsel from further acting for the Mother (“**Restraining Application**”). As a consequence, these 2 applications had to be dealt with first before the Application.

12     On 1 August 2019, I heard and dismissed the Recusal Application. On 11 August 2019, I heard and dismissed the Restraining Application. An appeal was filed only against the dismissal of the Restraining Application.

13     I finally heard the Application on 16 August 2019. In his supporting affidavit, the Father made several allegations about the Mother. These included allegations:

> (a)     that the Mother (and her boyfriend) smoked and this would have a negative impact on the son’s upbringing;

> (b)     that he was not consulted when the Mother enrolled the Children in their schools and that the Mother had selected these schools solely for her own convenience (as the schools were near the GP Home and her parents could fetch the Children home after school);

> (c)     that he had heard from his son that there was a smoking culture in his primary school and it was not in the son’s best interest to continue at that school;

> (d)     that the Mother had not put her mind on the school environment and its impact on the Children, and

> (e)     that the Mother was largely absent and the Children were being forced to be brought up by the grandparents.

14     The Father also claimed that the son’s maternal uncle **U** was abusive and had to be dissuaded from levying further punishment on the Children after he (the Father) took up an application against **U** for a personal protection order (“**PPO**”).

15     First, in relation to the Father’s PPO application against **U**, it should be noted that the complaint there was based on **U**’s alleged actions towards his nephew (and not both Children) during an incident on 9 November 2017 whilst they were walking in the rain to have dinner outside the GP Home. There were no allegations that **U** had been abusive in any way towards his niece (the parties’ daughter). After a full hearing, I had dismissed the PPO application in June 2018. On the evidence adduced before me at the hearing, I did not find that **U** had committed any family violence against his nephew and this decision was upheld on appeal (in DCA 54/2018) by the High Court.

16     As for the Father’s allegations about the Mother’s lack of care and concern for the Children, I noted that the Mother had in her affidavits (filed for the ancillaries) adduced evidence to show that this was not the case and that she was very much an involved and hands-on parent.[^1] As for the schools, they were located about the same distance from the parties’ respective residences and the Father’s claim that the son’s primary school had a smoking culture was also unsubstantiated. Counsel for the Mother had also referred to an affidavit filed by the Mother in June 2019 (in FC/SUM 2117/2019) that had disproved this unsubstantiated allegation.[^2] Indeed, this very same affidavit also showed the following evidence: (a) that the son was doing very well in his primary school and had been awarded the Edusave Merit Bursaries in 2017 and 2018, and (b) that the Mother had in fact been granted the right to decide on the primary school for the son pursuant to an order of Court dated 30 August 2016 (in FC/SUM 1788/2016).

17     I also noted the independent assessments set out in the SW Report. There was no reason to doubt the objectivity of this report which was prepared by an experienced senior counsellor. The counsellor had conducted, amongst other things, home visits and observations of each parent’s interaction with the Children and she had interviewed the parents and also each child separately. The assessments by the counsellor into the welfare of the Children and the care arrangements then existing were conducted mainly in March 2018.

18     The SW Report furnished in April 2018 indicated that both the Father and the Mother had close and loving relationships with their Children and it was evident that they only wanted their Children to receive the best from them. The Children were observed to be close to and happy with their Mother as well as with their Father. They were also seen to be relaxed and comfortable at the Father’s residence (the parties’ matrimonial home) and also at the GP Home. Both parties were also reported to have good support from their own mothers to help care for the Children.

19     The son (8 years old and attending primary 2) was observed to be healthy and agile. It was noted that he had very good reports from his school, in terms of both his academic achievements as well as his social and emotional development. There were no reports of any behavioural concerns. On the contrary, he was described by his class teacher as diligent, responsible and intelligent, with a positive attitude towards learning. He was well-behaved with good relationships with his peers and enjoyed participating in class activities.

20     The daughter (5 + years old and attending pre-school) was observed to be a healthy and active girl, who was happy, approachable and helpful. Her academic performance and her social and emotional development were observed to be fine.

21     The SW Report showed that the Children were happy and healthy children with warm and loving relationships with each of their parents notwithstanding their parents’ marital conflicts and divorce in 2016. The son was doing particularly well in his primary school as well. The SW Report did not disclose any indications that the Children were showing or suffering from any mental health issues, or that their mental well-beings were affected in any way that required assessments or therapeutic treatments from any medical specialist. Indeed, I noted that both Children (though young) were articulate in English and they were able to share with the counsellor in March 2018 what they enjoyed and did not enjoy about their living and care arrangements and their preferences and the reasons for those preferences.

22     There was no objective evidence adduced before me of any subsequent matters after March 2018 and the SW Report that showed that there was a need to have an expert appointed to adduce medical evidence as to the state of the Children’s mental well-being and condition. I was mindful of the caution sounded by the High Court in _L v J_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] SGHC 258</span> at \[7\] that there were too many instances of fighting spouses sending their children for psychiatric assessments purely for the purpose of strengthening their case in court and whilst “\[t\]heir hearts may be in the right place, that alone is insufficient justification” and that parties in every case ought first to consider whether a psychiatric assessment can truly be in the interests of the child.

23     Indeed, it did appear from a review of the draft letter of instruction attached to the Application (which was framed by the Father and had, as pointed out by the Mother’s counsel, untruths and unsubstantiated allegations) that he was merely seeking to gather ammunition for the care and control battle in the final ancillaries.[^3]

24     For all the above reasons, I was therefore not persuaded that it was necessary and in the interests of the Children, on the facts of this case, for either of the Children to be sent for a psychiatric assessment by a clinically –trained child psychiatrist in order to resolve the care and control and access disputes in the ancillaries. The Application was therefore disallowed with costs fixed at $2,000 to the Mother.

25     However, as the Children were a year older now and would have had more experiences with their existing living and care arrangements since March 2018, I was of the view that it was important to hear from them whether their perspectives and wishes had changed in any way and if so, the reasons for those changes. For this reason and to ensure that their interests were sufficiently addressed at the ancillaries, I therefore found it appropriate, in the circumstances for their voice to be heard through a Child Representative.

26     By my own motion, I therefore made the following orders on 16 August 2019:

> (a)     A Child Representative (“CR”) shall be appointed to represent the best interests of the Children in these proceedings. The CR will spend time with the children to understand their perspectives and their situations.

> (b)     The parties will, at a time or times to be fixed by the CR arrange for the Children to be present to meet with the CR either alone or in whatever arrangement as the CR may determine.

> (c)     The parties and their lawyers are to meet with the CR at a time (or times) to be fixed by the CR. They are to attend the first case conference with the CR on a stipulated date and time in the Family Justice Court.

> (d)     The CR shall be at liberty to speak to any or all of the teachers, school counsellors, relatives or other persons who the CR considers necessary and the parties are to provide their authority to disclose any or all relevant documents to the CR.

> (e)     The services provided by the CR are fixed at $1,000 for the first tier of fees, to be paid by the parties equally. The CR is at liberty to apply to Court for the second tier of fees which will be based on time costs and complexity of the case.
