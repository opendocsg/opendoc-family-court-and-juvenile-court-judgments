Family Law – Custody – Interim care and control – Interim access

18 November 2020

### District Judge Azmin Jailani:

1       This appeal deals with parties’ respective applications regarding the children of the marriage. Summons No. 846/2020 (“SUM 846”)[^1] was the plaintiff-husband’s application for interim care and control of the children (and correspondingly access to the defendant-wife) pending the resolution of the ancillary matters. Summons No. 943/2020 (“SUM 943”), on the other hand, was the defendant’s cross-application for essentially the opposite reliefs.

2       After hearing parties, I ordered that the defendant be granted interim care and control of the children pending the resolution of the ancillary matters. Consequentially, I ordered that the plaintiff be granted access to the children on the following terms:

> (a)     weekday access (Monday to Friday) from 3:30pm to 7:30pm;

> (b)     alternate weekend access from Friday 3:30pm to Saturday 8:30pm. Such alternate weekend access would commence from the weekend immediately after the date of my orders;

> (c)     alternate public holiday access from 9:30am to 8:00pm. Such alternate public holiday access would commence on the public holiday immediately occurring after the date of my orders;

> (d)     that during access, the domestic helper would be present;

> (e)     other than the domestic helper or any of the plaintiff’s family members, no other third party was to be present during the plaintiff’s access with the children;

> (f)     for all access sessions, handover was to take place at the defendant’s current residence at \[BR\]; and

> (g)     unless agreed by parties or with leave of court, none of the children were to be taken out of the country.

> (collectively, the “Access Orders”)

3       In making the above orders, I provided brief reasons for my decision.

4       The present appeal relates _solely_ to the defendant’s dissatisfaction against _some_ of the Access Orders highlighted above. Against that backdrop, I now provide full grounds of my decision.

## Background of the parties and the present dispute

5       Parties were married in November 2004. There are two children to the marriage. \[A\], the elder daughter, was born in March 2014. \[B\], the younger daughter, was born in November 2017.

6       During the subsistence of the marriage, parties and the children were living in the matrimonial home.

7       In April 2019, the plaintiff commenced divorce proceedings. In response, the defendant challenged the plaintiff’s claim, and filed her own counterclaim. Fortunately, after mediation, parties were able to come a resolution on the issue of divorce, and interim judgment was granted in November 2019 on both the plaintiff’s claim and the defendant’s counterclaim.

8       After interim judgment was granted and pending the resolution of the ancillary matters, sometime in March 2020, it was not disputed that the defendant moved out the matrimonial home with the children and the domestic helper. Whilst the _fact_ of the move was not disputed, parties’ respective narratives differ in terms of the _context and circumstance_ leading up to and surrounding the move.

9       After the move, parties corresponded _vide_ their solicitors to arrive at some resolution relating to the children’s arrangements. This included, among other things, the plaintiff’s request for the return of the children back to the matrimonial home, and the defendant’s proposals on interim access. Unfortunately, given the impasse (including the plaintiff’s contention that the defendant was not being facilitative with access), the plaintiff commenced SUM 846 on 16 March 2020.

10     In SUM 846, the plaintiff prayed for, among other things, that:

> \[t\]he status quo in relation to care and control of the children, \[A\] and \[B\] be preserved, until the Court’s determination on the ancillary issues.

11     As to what the ‘status quo’ meant, a review of the plaintiff’s supporting affidavit[^2] to SUM 846 indicates the plaintiff’s focus on the return of the children to the matrimonial home. In the same affidavit, the plaintiff also highlighted the defendant’s apparent disposition of taking the children away from the plaintiff without his notice.[^3]

12     Shortly thereafter, on 24 March 2020, the defendant commenced SUM 943. In her cross-application, the defendant prayed for, _inter alia_, the following reliefs:

> (a)     she be granted interim care and control of the children;

> (b)     the plaintiff be granted supervised access to the children on Wednesdays _and_ Fridays from 3:30pm to 8pm, and that the handover location be the guardhouse of \[BR\]; and

> (c)     should the plaintiff be unable to attend access, the plaintiff was to provide written notice of the same to the defendant (_via_ email or SMS) not less than 48 hours before the allocated time for access.

13     In short, the defendant was only prepared to grant the plaintiff limited supervised access on weekdays.

14     At a case conference for SUM 846 and SUM 943 on 24 March 2020, the Learned Assistant Registrar made the following access orders:

> (a)     pending the resolution of SUM 846 and SUM 943, the plaintiff be granted weekday access (i.e., Monday to Friday) from 3:30pm to 7:00pm;

> (b)     the domestic helper was to accompany the children during the plaintiff’s access; and

> (c)     the handover point would be \[BR\].

> (collectively, the “Provisional Access Orders”)

15     At the same case conference, the usual directions for the filing of reply affidavits were given.

16     After parties filed their affidavits and a hearing for both applications had been fixed, the plaintiff subsequently commenced Summons No. 1504/2020 (“SUM 1504”), seeking leave to file a further affidavit in response to the defendant’s affidavits. For procedural convenience, I directed that the case conference for SUM 1504 be heard together with SUM 846 and SUM 943.

17     At the hearing on 19 June 2020, the defendant’s counsel, Ms Wong, indicated that she was not objecting to SUM 1504, save that the defendant be granted a final right of reply. The plaintiff’s counsel, Mr Loh, had no objections to Ms Wong’s request. Accordingly, I made the necessary orders and directions for the filing of the plaintiff’s supplementary affidavit and the defendant’s final reply.

18     I pause here and note that at that hearing, and given the Provisional Access Orders made, I sought Mr Loh’s clarification on what the plaintiff was seeking in terms of his prayer for the “status quo” in SUM 846. Mr Loh informed me that he wished to make the necessary amendments to SUM 846 to clarify that position, which I allowed. I also note at that hearing that notwithstanding the prayers sought in SUM 943, Ms Wong clarified that the defendant’s position was for the Provisional Access Orders _to remain_.

19     Further to my directions, on 23 June 2020, the plaintiff filed his amendment to SUM 846 (“SUM 846 A1”). In SUM 846 A1, the plaintiff clarified his prayers as follows:

> (a)     the children be returned to the matrimonial home;

> (b)     the plaintiff be granted interim care and control of the children;

> (c)     the defendant be granted access to the children on the following terms:

>> (i)       weekend overnight access from Friday 6:00pm to Monday 6:00pm;

>> (ii)       the defendant will pick up and drop off point shall be the matrimonial home;

>> (iii)       should the defendant not be able to exercise her access time, she was to give written notice of the same (by email or SMS) no less than 48 hours because the scheduled access time; and

>> (iv)       that the children’s passports be handed over to the plaintiff.

## Main issues arising in this appeal

21     For ease of reference, I set out in tabular form below the specific Access Orders the defendant was appealing against (i.e., Column A), and the specific prayers sought by her in SUM 943 for the same matter where applicable (i.e., Column B). The difference between the Access Orders and the defendant’s prayers in SUM 943 are italicised.

22     Where appropriate, and in providing a more contextual comparison between Column A and Column B, I have also included certain supplementary comments (i.e., Column C).

23     As can be seen from the table above, half of the Access Orders appealed against (i.e., S/Nos. 1 and 4) _mirror the Provisional Access Orders_, orders which the defendant herself submitted ought to apply. It is therefore unclear as to the basis of the defendant’s dissatisfaction against those orders.

24     As for the remaining Access Orders (i.e., S/Nos. 2 and 3), the main issue arising in this appeal relates to my decision to _moderately expand_ the plaintiff’s access in the interim period pending the conclusion of the ancillary matters.

## Parties’ cases in brief

25     As noted earlier, what initially sparked SUM 846 was the removal of the children from the matrimonial home. It was also on that basis that the plaintiff sought interim care and control of the children. In support of his application, the plaintiff also highlighted how the defendant’s long working hours as compared to his flexible hours as a property agent allowed him to better care for the children.[^6] After SUM 846 was amended to SUM 846 A1, the defendant further highlighted issues with the plaintiff complying with the Provisional Access Orders,[^7] and how it seemed that the defendant was externalising and transferring her discontent of the plaintiff in the children’s presence, to the extent that it has affected how the children have recently interacted with the plaintiff.[^8]

26     As regards the defendant, she sought to highlight, among other things, (i) the plaintiff’s allegedly “despicable behaviour” causing her to leave the matrimonial home;[^9] (ii) the plaintiff’s alleged alienation of the children from the defendant;[^10] (iii) the impending sale of the matrimonial home (which in turn allowed for \[BR\] to be a more stable place of residence for the children; (iv) the plaintiff’s ability to understand the children’s need better and be a better caregiver for them;[^11] (v) the defendant’s financial stability;[^12] and (vi) issues with the plaintiff’s new relationship vis-à-vis the children.[^13]

27     To summarise, the thrust of the defendant’s case was that it was in the children’s interest to continue staying with her in \[BR\], and that, for better continuity[^14], she continue to be the children’s caregiver. In this connection, the defendant also sought to contend why the Provisional Access Orders were enough,[^15] and how the plaintiff’s “living arrangements and lack of concrete plans for the care of the \[c\]hildren cannot be said to support any overnight access to him”.

## Applicable principles and my findings

### Applicable principles – access

28     As with all applications involving children, it goes without saying that such applications ultimately involve an assessment of the welfare and best interests of the child. When it comes to access, I found it apposite to note that such an assessment is imprecise, because the court is placed in the unenviable position of attempting to assess and adjudicate a matter which would otherwise be within the sole province of the child’s parents. How a parent ought and should spend time with his or her child(ren) (and how much time is spent) cannot, in my view, be assessed in any formulaic fashion. Different families differently assess the types of trade-offs they are willing to take in managing the overall well-being of their child. This includes how the child occupies his or her time.

29     That said, I considered it apposite in the present circumstances to refer to the comments made by the authors of _Law and Practice of Family Law in Singapore_ (Valerie Thean JC, Foo Siew Fong, Sweet & Maxwell Asia 2016)(at \[10.4.3.1\] to \[10.4.33\]):

> Accordingly, access is the _right of the child to spend time and to maintain an ongoing relationship with the parent who does not reside with them_.

> Access can be denied by the court if it is established that access will not be in the interest of the child.

> The parent with whom care and control vests is _expected to facilitate access_ between the child and the other parent.

> (emphasis added)

30     What can be discerned from the foregoing is that absent any justifiable factor(s) that could be detrimental to the child, the child has the inalienable right to an ongoing relationship with the non-care parent. Such a relationship, in my view, ought to be as if, or practically as as close to, the situation where the family _had not broken down_. The corollary to this was, in my view, an equally important and fundamental point – that the non-care parent has the _right_ to have as much of a relationship with the child as practically possible.

31     When viewed from that perspective, I am of the view that absent the justifiable factors mentioned above, the non-care parent should be able to reasonably spend _as much actual time with the child as possible_.

32     I pause here and clarify that this does not necessarily mean that the non-care parent should, as a default or starting point, always be entitled to unfettered access. Whilst the notions of family justice seek to achieve some equitable norm between parties, the court is not naïve to the reality that parties, like the plaintiff and defendant in the present case, find themselves in the situation they are in specifically because of a fundamental breakdown in the relationship. This breakdown has, along the way, shaped their behaviour with each other, and invariably their children.

33     What has also happened along the way is that, given the imperfect nature of time as a barometer of equity, parties have, sometimes unwittingly, commoditised or weaponised the children’s time to their own subjective gauge of ‘success’ over the other party. This arises from a misguided sense of entitlement, unresolved anger, or even a genuine and intolerable difference of opinion. In doing so, parties sometimes miss the forest from the trees, and this can potentially cause negative and long-lasting effects to the child. These are the possible side effects that the court seeks to address, in an appropriate and measured approach, depending on the circumstances of the case and the juncture of the proceedings.

34     With those observations in mind, I now turn to the Access Orders the defendant has appealed against which I have highlighted in the table at \[22\] above (i.e., the “Appeal Table”).

### Defendant’s appeal against Access Orders Nos. 1 and 4

35     I first deal with Item Nos. 1 and 4 of the Appeal Table. As I had highlighted above, those Access Orders essentially mirror the Provisional Access Orders (especially Item 4 relating to the presence of the domestic helper). This was what the defendant herself highlighted should apply in her affidavit[^16] as well as in her written submissions. In the premises, it is unclear as to why the defendant is appealing against those orders, and I say no further on the matter.

36     The only meaningful departure from the Provisional Access Orders is that I granted the plaintiff an additional half hour of weekday access (i.e., instead of access ending at 7:00pm, it was to end at 7:30pm). If the defendant’s principle complaint was this additional ½ hour, I did not see a justifiable basis for the defendant’s complaint. Whilst not determinative, I do note the defendant’s acknowledgement of there being minor delays in handing over. When viewed in this manner, the additional ½ hour was a reasonable allowance to address matters which, to a greater or lesser extent, are not uncommon when it comes to access.

37     In any case, I also found it relevant to point out that in her own prayers in SUM 943, she sought for weekday access _to end at 8pm_, which was ½ hour _more than_ what I eventually ordered.

### Defendant’s appeal against Access Order No. 3 (Alternate public holiday access)

38     I now turn to Item No. 3 of the Appeal Table, where I granted the plaintiff alternate public holiday access from 9:30am to 8:00pm. For ease of analysis, I categorise the order into two parts - first being the issue of granting public holiday access, and second the time allocated to the plaintiff.

39     In terms of public holiday access generally, I was of the view that granting the plaintiff such time would allow him a more meaningful stretch of time to be with the children (as opposed to the 4-hour block during weekdays). In this regard, and taking the defendant’s documents at its highest, there was nothing to suggest how, conceptually, alternate public holiday access would be sufficiently detrimental or contrary to the children’s welfare that it should not be provided for. This also accords with the observations I made that absent any justifiable grounds, there is little reason why the plaintiff should not be able to spend time with his daughters during the public holiday.

40     In terms of the length of time, I similarly was not convinced that there was anything before me which suggested that having a slightly longer block of time during a public holiday would detrimentally affect the children. I also note that given that the defendant’s domestic helper was around during access times, there would have been nothing preventing the domestic helper to raise to the defendant any issues during access.

### Defendant’s appeal against Access Order No. 2 (alternate overnight access)

41     The last order relates to Item No. 2 of the Appeal Table, where I granted the plaintiff alternate overnight access.

42     On her documents, the defendant took issue with the impending sale of the matrimonial property[^17] and a lack of a proper support network for the children (both of who are girls)[^18] as reasons why the plaintiff should not have care and control of the children. In that context, the defendant’s contention was that the plaintiff’s living arrangements were far inferior to the defendant such that it did not justify breaking the children’s living arrangements with the defendant.

43     Whilst that may be the case for the purposes of ascertaining care and control (which I was inclined to agree with despite some reservations I had with how the mother moved the children out of the matrimonial home, and was in any case not the subject of this appeal), did these contentions have equal force against the children staying with the father _in the matrimonial home for one night every fortnight?_ Did these contentions have such force when the domestic helper would be present during such access?

44     When queried at the hearing, Ms Wong’s candid submission was simply that the defendant had no confidence in the plaintiff’s care giving abilities. Be that as it may, there was nothing in the material before me to suggest any significant issues with the plaintiff being alone with the children in the same house.[^19]

45     Further, I was not convinced how one overnight stay in a fortnight would be an insurmountable disruption to the children’s routine that it was against their welfare to spend a night with their father in the matrimonial home where they were living at all material times until the move to \[BR\].

## Conclusion

46     For the reasons above, and whilst I agreed that the Provisional Access Orders ought to remain, I was not inclined to accept the defendant’s contention that the plaintiff’s access be strictly limited to the Provisional Access Orders. In the present circumstances and the material before me, there was nothing militating against a modest expansion in the plaintiff’s access.

47     Whilst not the subject matter of the present appeal, for completeness, I make some brief comments on the issue of costs. In making the Access Orders, I essentially agreed with the defendant that she had interim care and control of the children. On that basis, I dismissed SUM 846 (i.e., the plaintiff’s application for interim care and control, and access to the defendant). As regard SUM 943, I granted the defendant’s prayer for interim care and control of the children, but for the reasons stated above, deferred from her prayers on access.

48     Whilst I acknowledge that it was the defendant who was successful in substantively maintaining the status quo (i.e., interim care and control and the Provisional Access Orders), I was also of the view that there was no cogent material before me for the defendant to have refused to increase access. This must be viewed in the context of my reservations as to the defendant’s conduct is relocating the children from the matrimonial home to \[BR\].

49     For the reasons stated above, and mindful of the fact that parties’ respective positions may be properly vindicated at the hearing of the ancillary matters, I was of the view that the appropriate order to be made was for costs of SUM 846 and SUM 943 to be in the cause of the ancillary matters.

50     Finally, I would like to thank Mr Loh and Ms Wong for their assistance and patience on the matter.
