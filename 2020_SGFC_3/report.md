Family Law – Ancillary Matters – section 112, 113, 124 & 127 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353)

10 January 2020

### District Judge Cheryl Koh:

## A.    Introduction

1       These are the ancillary matters arising out of a divorce involving: (a) the division of matrimonial assets; (b) custody, care and control and access of a child; (c) maintenance for the wife; and (d) maintenance of a child.

2       On 20 September 2019, I made an order in terms of the agreement parties had recorded at the mediation session at the Family Justice Courts’ Child Focused Resolution Centre (CFRC) on 26 March 2018 (the “**Settlement Agreement**”). The Wife has appealed. There is no appeal by the Husband.

3       Essentially, I considered that the Settlement Agreement was to be given conclusive weight in the ancillary matters, as (a) parties had completed one round of discovery for the mediation; (b) parties were legally represented and had the benefit of independent legal advice; (c) parties freely recorded the Settlement Agreement before a mediator-former judge in the presence of their lawyers; (d) parties had in fact believed that a consent order and not mere agreement had been recorded. This will be elaborated upon below.

4       In the present case, there is no good reason why the defendant wife (the “**Wife**”) should be allowed to resile from the Settlement Agreement, just because she changed her mind subsequent to the CFRC mediation. She claimed she agreed to the terms of the Settlement Agreement as she was not aware of the full extent of the assets of the plaintiff husband (the “**Husband**”), and was further desperate to see their child (the “**Child**”). For the reasons explained below, these reasons are not made out and are in any event, insufficient to justify a departure from the terms of the Settlement Agreement. Nonetheless, I considered that even if the Settlement Agreement was not to be given conclusive weight in the ancillary matters, I would have reached a decision that would not be dissimilar to its terms, in effecting a just and equitable division of matrimonial assets, assessing reasonable maintenance and making custody orders on the Child.

## B.    Background facts

5       Parties were married on 23 March 2011. On 8 December 2017, the Husband left the matrimonial home with the Child. The Husband commenced divorce proceedings in November 2017 and Interim Judgment was granted on 20 July 2018. The marriage therefore lasted about 6 years (until physical separation) or 7 years (until the Interim Judgment).

6       There is one (1) child to the marriage, one girl aged 7 years old and studying in primary one. The Wife has a 19-year old daughter (“**A**”) from her previous marriage, who is studying in the first year of polytechnic and resides with the Wife.

7       The Husband is a Singaporean citizen, and is 61 years old and a director of two construction companies. The Wife is from China but obtained Singaporean citizenship after marriage. She is 41 years old and currently works as a waitress at xxx. She was working as a prostitute in Singapore when the Husband met and married her. Parties’ divorce case was reported on the front page of the Chinese newspaper, ShinMin Daily News, on xxx[^1].

8       After the Husband left the matrimonial home with the Child in December 2017, parties were unable to agree on care arrangements for the Child and frequently engaged in snatching of the Child from her then kindergarten. It is disputed between parties as to who had more care of the Child during this period. On 26 March 2018, parties settled the terms of the divorce and ancillary matters at the CFRC. Parties recorded the following Settlement Agreement with regard to the ancillary matters before a mediator-former judge in the presence of their lawyers:

> _“(a_)     _Parties shall have joint custody of \[the Child\] XX with shared care and control as follows:_

>> (1)     _The \[Husband\] shall have care and control from 9PM on Saturday to Wednesday 6PM;_

>> (2)     _The \[Wife\] shall have care and control from Wednesday 6PM to Saturday 9PM;_

>> (3)     _Each party shall have \[the Child\] for half of the June and December school holidays;_

>> (4)     _For the public holidays, birthday and the March and September school holidays, parties shall care and control as provided in paragraphs (i) and (ii) above;_

>> (5)     _For the odd numbered years on which Chinese New Year (“CNY”) falls, the \[Husband\] shall have \[the Child\] on the eve of CNY and the 1_ st _day of CNY and the \[Wife\] shall have \[the Child\] from 9am to 9pm of the 2_ nd _day of CNY. For the even-numbered on which CNY falls, the \[Wife\] shall have \[the Child\] on the eve of CNY and the 1_ st _day of CNY and the \[Husband\] shall have \[the Child\] from 9am to 9pm of the 2_ nd _day of CNY;_

>> (6)     _Neither party shall bring the child out of jurisdiction without the prior written consent of the other party._

> (_b_)     _The \[Husband\] shall pay to the \[Wife\] the sum of $250.00 per month as maintenance for the child XXX with effect from 7th day of April 2018 and thereafter on the 7th day of each month. This sum shall be deposited into the \[Wife\]’s designated bank account. The \[Husband\] shall also bear all the fees for the childcare, school fees, up the local tertiary level, uniform, books and medical expenses._

> (_c_)     _the \[Husband\] shall pay to the \[Wife\] the sum of $20,000.00 in full and final settlement of division of all matrimonial assets. The \[Husband\] shall pay this amount within 7 days of the extraction of the Final Judgment._

> (_d_)     _There shall be no maintenance for the \[Wife\]._

> (_e_)     _Each party to keep all assets under his/her own name._

> (_f_)     _the \[Wife\] shall be allowed to continue to stay in the matrimonial home until two weeks after the date of extraction of the final judgment._

> (_g_)     _There shall be no order as to costs._

> (_h_)     _Liberty to apply.”_

9       The Settlement Agreement was to be extracted as part of the consent orders in the Interim Judgment, after the amendment of pleadings and setting down of divorce on an uncontested basis. The Wife however appointed new solicitors on 20 April 2018. She informed the Court that notwithstanding the Settlement Agreement, she was willing only for the divorce to be uncontested, but the ancillary matters were to be adjourned to be contested. Interim Judgment was hence extracted on that basis and the Settlement Agreement was never extracted as part of the consent orders in the Interim Judgment. Parties have however been complying with the Settlement Agreement in terms of the shared care arrangements and maintenance of the Child.

10     On 11 January 2019, the Wife filed an application to vary the consent order to obtain sole care and control of the Child. On 9 April 2019, I made no orders on the application, as there was in fact no consent order to be varied. The Wife then decided to seek sole care and control of the Child in this hearing of the ancillary matters instead.

11     The affidavits and submissions filed by the parties are as follows:

> (a)     the Husband’s 1st Affidavit of Assets and Means (“**AOM**”) filed on 20 September 2018;

> (b)     the Wife’s 1st AOM filed on 20 September 2018;

> (c)     the Husband’s 2nd AOM filed on 10 June 2019;

> (d)     the Wife’s 2nd AOM filed on 10 June 2019;

> (e)     the Husband’s 3rd AOM filed on 05 July 2019;

> (f)     the Wife’s 3rd AOM filed on 18 July 2019;

> (g)     the Husband’s Submissions filed on 21 August 2019; and

> (h)     the Wife’s Submissions filed on 21 August 2019.

## C.    Grounds of Decision

### The law on marital agreements

12     In the division of matrimonial assets, section 112 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353) (the “**_Women’s Charter_**”) requires the Court to have regard to all circumstances of the case, including a non-exhaustive list of factors set out therein. One factor which is of particular significance in this case is that set out in section 112(2)(e) of the Women’s Charter, which is “_any agreement between the parties with respect to the ownership and division of matrimonial assets made in contemplation of divorce_”.

13     Even if there is an agreement falling within section 112(e) of the Women’s Charter exists, such agreements in respect of the division of matrimonial assets are not enforceable in and of themselves. Ultimate power is vested in the court in the case at hand to divide matrimonial assets in a proportion which is just and equitable: per the Court of Appeal in _AOO v AON_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 4 SLR 1169</span> at \[19\]. How much weight the court accords to a marital agreement depends on the division under the agreement as well as the facts of the case, which means that not only the terms but also the parties’ conduct surrounding the making and the execution of the agreement would be scrutinised: per the Honourable Justice Belinda Ang in _Wong Kien Keong v Khoo Hoon Eng_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 1 SLR 1342</span> (“_Wong Kien Keong_”).

14     In _Lee Min Jai v Chua Cheow Koon_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 1 SLR(R) 548</span>, the Honourable Justice Choo Han Teck emphasized that the court should not revise the terms of a settlement agreement merely so that they appear more equitable:

> “_\[s112 of the Women’s Charter\], and the authorities referred to by Mr Chia,_**_should not be construed as an invitation to revise the terms of a settlement merely so that they appear more equitable_**_or will be, in fact, more equitable in the objective opinion of the court. Privately settled terms in respect of the ancillary matters in a divorce may not always appear to be fair. But divorce is a very personal matter, and each party would have his own private reasons for demanding, or acquiescing, to any given term or condition in the ultimate settlement. What the court should be alert to, is that one party had not taken an_**_unfair advantage_**_over the other in the course of negotiating and settling the terms. Hence, in Dean v Dean \[1978\] 3 All ER 758, the court held (as set out in the headnote) that:_

>> “_Where an agreement between the parties had been reached at arm’s length and the parties had been separately advised, the agreement itself would be prima facie evidence of the reasonableness of its terms, and formal discovery would probably be unnecessary_.”

15     In _Wong Kien Keong_, applying the above principles, parties agreed the division of assets as set out in a deed should be 66% in the plaintiff’s favour and 34% in the defendant’s favour. The defendant subsequently contended that a just division should be 60% in the defendant’s favour. The court gave weight to the deed and found that a just and equitable division of assets should be a 40% division in the defendant’s favour, which is close to the 34% division stated in the deed.

16      _Surindar Singh v Sita Jaswant Kaur_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 3 SLR 1284</span> (“**_Surindar Singh_**”) is a further instance where it was held by the Court of Appeal that the settlement agreement reached between parties who were legally represented at a mediation was to be given conclusive weight in the division of matrimonial assets.

17     Similar principles apply with regard to the effect of the Settlement Agreement on maintenance for the Wife and the Child, and the custody agreement for the Child, in that these agreements are not enforceable in and of themselves. The Court has the ultimate power to assess reasonable maintenance and make custody orders in the best interests of the child, but this includes giving conclusive weight to the Settlement Agreement.

### The effect of the Settlement Agreement

18     In the present case, there is no reason why the Settlement Agreement ought not to be given conclusive weight in the ancillary matters. The mediation took place at the CFRC, which is a well-established family dispute resolution set up within the Family Justice Courts to assist parties to resolve family disputes in a less acrimonious manner. The mediation was conducted for several hours by a mediator who is a specially trained and appointed former judge, Ms Tan Peck Cheng. Parties also attended long counselling sessions before a court family specialist, who is a specially appointed counsellor with expertise in child welfare. Parties exchanged discovery for the mediation beforehand. Parties were represented by their own respective set of lawyers (the Wife was legally aided and was represented by Chee Wai Pong & Co), and thus had the benefit of independent legal advice. At the conclusion of the mediation, parties signed on the draft of the Settlement Agreement before the mediator in the presence of their lawyers.

19     The Wife claimed she was desperate to see the Child and hence agreed to a settlement, but the evidence showed that she had in fact snatched the Child from her kindergarten multiple times since December 2017. In particular, on 12 March 2018, she took the Child from her kindergarten and refused to let the Husband see the Child thereafter. On the day of the mediation on 26 March 2018, the Wife brought the Child to CFRC. After recording the Settlement Agreement, the Wife left with the Child as 26 March 2018 was a Wednesday when the Wife would have care and control under the terms of the settlement. This showed that the Wife was in fact with the Child and could not have been desperate to see her or agreed to a settlement just to see her. As for the Wife’s claim that she did not know the full extent of the Husband’s assets, the evidence showed that she was in fact aware of what his assets were. The Wife knew that the Husband worked in his own business in construction, she knew he had a factory unit because she had previously lived in it, and she knew he had a HDB as it was their matrimonial home. These were the Husband’s significant assets. She was legally represented and had the benefit of advice at the mediation; hence, she could have chosen to hold off the settlement and discover the full extent of the value of the Husband’s businesses if she felt that $20,000.00 was insufficient as a settlement sum, but she did not.

20     As the Husband put it succinctly in his 2nd AOM:

> _“6_.     _I verily believe that the Defendant should not be allowed to resile from our agreement signed on 26 March 2018 and that a final order should be given in the same terms as our Agreement. The Agreement dealt with all issues pertaining to the custody, care, control, and access of the child of the marriage (the “Custody Issues”), all issues pertaining to maintenance of the child and ex-wife of the marriage (the “Maintenance Issues”), and all issues pertaining to the division of matrimonial assets. The Defendant was well aware of her legal rights, had undergone long counselling sessions together with me, the Defendant had received documents relating to my assets and means, and the Defendant signed the Agreement in front of a well-trained Mediator who used to be a District Judge of the Family Courts._

> _7_.     _When the Settlement Agreement was drafted during mediation, the Defendant and I were advised by our lawyers to voice out any concerns we had in the Settlement Agreement. The Mediator Tan Peck Cheng also asked us to ensure that all our concerns had been addressed and to leave no loose ends in this matter. After a few hours of intense discussion and negotiation over the terms, the Settlement Agreement was signed by us in the presence of our lawyers, the translator, and the Mediator Tan Peck Cheng.”_

21     In any case, even if the Settlement Agreement is not to be given conclusive weight in the ancillary matters, I would have reached a decision that would not be dissimilar to its terms, as will be explained below.

### Division of matrimonial assets

22     In determining what would be a just and equitable division of matrimonial assets, it would entail an application of the structured approach in the Court of Appeal’s decision of _ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span>. This involves delineating the matrimonial pool, ascribing a ratio for parties’ direct financial contributions and indirect contributions, and deriving each party’s average percentage contributions with any further adjustments.

##### Value of the matrimonial pool

23     I find that the net value of the matrimonial pool to be around $700,000.00, determined as follows:

##### Direct contributions

24     This meant that the Husband’s direct contributions to the matrimonial pool amount to 95% ($664,997.50/$702,230.56), whilst the Wife’s direct contributions amount to 5% ($37,233.05/$702,230.56).

##### Indirect contributions

25     The Wife did not ascribe a ratio for parties’ indirect contributions but argued that she should be entitled to 40% of the matrimonial pool[^3]. The Husband claimed that he made higher indirect contributions to the marriage, as he worked flexible hours in his business, cared for the Child and did the household chores.

26     I find indirect contributions in this short marriage of about 6 years (till physical separation) to be about equal. The Husband was the sole breadwinner and made all indirect financial contributions such as paying for the utilities, property tax, and conservancy charges. As he worked in his own business, he had a more flexible arrangement and helped in the care of the Child, as may also be evident by the Child’s expressed closeness with the Husband. The Wife was a homemaker and cared for the Child. She however returned to work by 2016.

##### Final ratio

27     Attributing weightage of 75% to direct contributions and 25% to indirect contributions in this short marriage of 6 years (until physical separation), it meant that the Husband is entitled to about 85% of the matrimonial pool, whilst the Wife is entitled to 15%, or $105,334.58 (15% of $702,230.56**)**. After deducting the Wife’s sole assets of $37,233.05, it meant that the Husband should pay the Wife the sum of about $68,000.00 ($105,334.58 less $37,233.05). This sum is not materially different from the sum of $20,000.00, which the Husband had agreed to pay to the Wife under the Settlement Agreement. It must also be borne in mind that the Court should not revise the terms of the Settlement Agreement merely so that it appeared more equitable. In these circumstances, I am of the view that it is just and equitable for the division of matrimonial assets to be made in terms of the Settlement Agreement.

28     It must also be borne in mind that the Wife has other financial resources which she could rely on: she has an ICBC bank account in China which statements have not been disclosed herein. Further, whilst the Wife claimed that the property in China left to her by her previous husband (now deceased) could not be transferred into her name (despite the lack of documentary proof in this regard), she at the very least has control over a property in China which she could live in, or even rent out.

### Maintenance for the Wife

29     The Wife sought maintenance in the event that she received less than 50% of the matrimonial pool. The Husband offered no maintenance for the Wife, per the terms of the Settlement Agreement.

30     I find that the Wife should not be entitled to any maintenance, as the Wife’s admitted income of around $3,000.00 per month is more than sufficient to cover her claimed expenses of just over $1,000.00, as follows:-

### Custody, care & control and access of the Child

31     The Wife sought sole care and control of the Child as she claimed that parties were unable to co-parent and the shared care and control arrangements were unworkable. The Husband’s position is that shared care and control per the Settlement Agreement should remain, and that the Mother was incapable of taking care of the Child.

32     I conducted an interview of the Child together with a counsellor from the Family Justice Courts’ Counselling and Psychological Services department. The counsellor has prepared a confidential report dated 9 September 2019. It is clear from the report that the Child is well-adjusted in the shared arrangements routine. When the Father has care and control of the Child from Saturdays to Wednesdays, they live in the Father’s mother’s two-storied landed home together with the Father’s mother, the Father’s brother and his wife who are helping to care for their 2 grandchildren aged 9 and 7 years old, and a domestic helper. The Father thus has a strong support network where the Child expressed being close and attached especially to the Father, the Father’s mother and the Father’s brother’s granddaughter aged 9 years old (close to the Child’s age), and where the domestic helper attended to the basic needs of the family. The Child also stays back for extra classes in school on Mondays to Wednesdays. On the other hand, when the Wife has care and control of the Child from Wednesdays to Saturdays, the Wife is highly reliant on afterschool care and the Wife’s 19 year old daughter, A. This is because the Wife worked the midnight shift almost every evening (from about 8.00PM to 6.00AM) at xxx (save for her offdays on Thursdays). In the daytime, the Wife would leave the Child at studentcare after the Child finished school, and leave the Child with A in the evenings and overnights when the Wife is at work. The Child however expressed being close to her step-sister, A. Given that the Child is well settled and adjusted in the shared routine, I saw no reason for her care arrangements as set out under the Settlement Agreement to be disturbed. Parties must learn to co-operate and overcome their issues (including logistical issues such as who is to pick up the Child) to give the Child a loving and stable environment in both homes in the long term.

### Maintenance for the Child

33     The Wife sought maintenance of $1,000.00 per month for the Child, based on the Child’s claimed expenses as follows:

34     The Husband’s position is that maintenance should remain at $250.00 per month per the Settlement Agreement.

35     I considered that the Child resided with the Husband for 4 nights per week, and the Husband also incurred daily expenses for the Child including food, transport, clothing and other necessities. Under the Settlement Agreement, the Husband is further responsible for all of the Child’s educational and medical expenses, including childcare, school fees up to tertiary level and uniform/school books. The Husband also paid for other expenses of the Child directly, such as insurance of $326.00 per month. In these circumstances, the Wife needed to manage only the Child’s daily expenses in her own household for 3 nights per week. With the Wife’s income of $3,000.00 per month and the sum of $250.00 contributed by the Husband, the Wife should be able to cover these daily and household expenses. I thus upheld the Settlement Agreement in terms of maintenance for the Child.

### Maintenance of A

36     The Wife claimed against the Husband for a lump-sum maintenance of $31,524.00 (based on a monthly sum of $2,000.00) for A. She argued that A has been accepted as a child of the family after marriage. The Husband maintained that A had been deliberately left out of the terms of the Settlement Agreement, as the Wife accepted that the Husband would have no responsibility for A, who is the Wife’s child from a previous marriage and not the Husband’s biological child. The Husband would also have no future rights of access to A. I accepted the Husband’s arguments and do not see why the Husband should pay any maintenance for A. As the Court of Appeal stated in _TDT v TDS_ \[2016\] SGCA at \[124\]:

> “_Whilst a parent continues to have a duty to maintain his or her biological children under s 68 of the Act whether or not such children are in the custody of that parent_, **_a non-parent does not stand in the same position_**_. In the usual case, the breakdown of a marriage would result in the_ **_non-parent losing custody of, and perhaps even access to, the child. It would not be fair to the non-parent to require him or her, in such circumstances, to continue maintaining the child_**” (emphasis added).

## D.    Conclusion

37     In these circumstances, I made an order-in-terms of the Settlement Agreement recorded on 26 March 2018 (set out in \[7\] above), with a clarification that the Wife shall be allowed to reside in the HDB until after two weeks of the Final Judgment extracted herein.
