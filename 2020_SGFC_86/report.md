Family Law – Declaration of non-exclusive jurisdiction

21 October 2020

### District Judge Darryl Soh:

## Introduction

1       This matter concerns two almost identical applications for a stay of proceedings and a declaration filed in respect of concluded cross Originating Summons Nos 230/2017 and 267/2017 by UQN _vide_ SUMs 877/2020 and 878/2020 respectively (collectively referred to as “the SUMs”). UQN is the Plaintiff in the former and the Defendant in the latter originating matter. I will hereafter refer to UQN as the “Mother”, UQO as the “Father”, and both of them collectively as the “Parties”.

2       At the hearing on 9 July 2020, the Mother’s counsel applied for me to first hear the Mother’s prayer for a declaration that the Singapore Family Justice Courts (“FJC”) is not a court of exclusive continuing jurisdiction for proceedings involving the Parties. If successful, the Mother will apply for leave for the remaining substantive prayers to be withdrawn. At the conclusion of the hearing, I granted the declaration sought, with amendments. I consequently granted the Mother leave to withdraw the remaining substantive prayers and I made no order as to costs. The Father has since appealed against my decision. In these grounds, I explain my decision in greater detail.

3       In the SUMs, the Mother filed identical affidavits in support. The Father was however unable to arrange for his reply affidavit to be notarised by the stipulated timeline and filed his draft affidavit instead. While I noted the Mother’s objection, I exercised my discretion to accept the filing of the draft affidavit and proceeded to deal with the applications in the interest of a just, expeditious and economical disposal of the matter.

## Background to the Dispute and Procedural History

4       The Parties were married in 2003 in the United States of America (“USA”). The Mother is an American citizen and the Father is a Norwegian citizen. The Parties were blessed with three children (collectively referred to as “the Children”), all of whom were both American and Norwegian citizens. As at the time of the hearing on 9 July 2020, there was no dispute that the Mother and the Children were domiciled in the USA and the Father was domiciled in Norway.

5       The family moved to Singapore in 2009 because of the Father’s employment. The Mother was a homemaker and the Father was the sole breadwinner of the family. Sometime in December 2015, the Father was terminated from his employment. From January 2016, he started work as a consultant in a company in Singapore, which allowed the family to continue residing in Singapore. Sometime in the autumn of 2017, the Father accepted a job in Norway and he made preparations for the family to move to Norway. According to the Mother, she characterised the family’s time in Singapore as “only transient relating only to the \[Father’s\] employment”[^1] and that the Father moved[^2] to Norway in December 2017.

6       Transient as it may have been suggested by the Mother, the tail end of the family’s time in Singapore in 2017 saw the start of a series of acrimonious proceedings both in Singapore and abroad. This unfortunately did not see any abatement with the passage of time. Below, I summarise the significant milestones of this cross-border litigation for context and it is by no means intended to be an attempt to paint an exhaustive landscape of the battle waged thus far.

7       The Mother and Father filed cross Originating Summons Nos 230/2017 and 267/2017 respectively wherein care orders for the Children were sought from the FJC. On 2 July 2018, District Judge Jinny Tan granted the Parties joint custody of the Children and their care and control to the Mother. In addition, the Father was granted leave to make arrangements for the Children to relocate permanently by end August 2018 and to settle in Norway. Prior to the relocation, the Father was ordered to pay to the Mother a monthly sum of $9,600 for the maintenance of the Children. After the above-mentioned relocation, the Father was ordered to maintain the Children solely. The learned District Judge also ordered the Father to pay the Mother a monthly sum of $2,525 as wife’s maintenance.[^3]

8       The Mother appealed against the orders made on 2 July 2018, though she eventually withdrew her appeal. She also applied for leave to relocate with the Children to Wilmette, State of Illinois, USA and to reside there on a permanent basis. District Judge Jinny Tan heard the application and granted the Mother leave to do so on 5 October 2018. The Father was granted liberal access to the Children on scheduled and detailed terms. He was also ordered to pay the Mother a monthly sum of USD $4,500 for the maintenance of the Children after they relocated to the USA. The learned District Judge’s Grounds of Decision can be found at _UQN v UQO_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGFC 107</span>.

9       The Father filed an appeal on 5 October 2018 in the Singapore High Court Family Division, _inter alia_, against the decision to grant leave to the Mother to relocate with the Children to the USA. Meanwhile, the Mother applied to stay the hearing of the Father’s appeal pending the payment of the maintenance arrears. As at 16 March 2020, the Mother averred that the Father was in maintenance arrears of up to SGD $162,151.94. By an Order of Court dated 16 April 2019, Judicial Commissioner Tan Puay Boon ordered the stay that the Mother sought.

10     Meanwhile in Norway, the Father filed for legal separation on 15 October 2018. A separation license was subsequently granted by the County Governor of Norway and it was sent to the Mother at the end of November 2019.[^4] Accordingly to the Mother, the separation license was being contested because the Father did not follow the required procedure of going through compulsory mediation and reported that he did not have her contact details to contact her for mediation. According to the Father, the Ministry of Children, Youth, and Families, rejected the Mother’s claims and upheld the separation.[^5]

11     In the USA, the Father filed a “Petition for Enrollment and Enforcement of Foreign Child-Custody Determinations” on 12 June 2019 in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, USA to mirror the Singapore orders made on 2 July 2018 and 26 November 2018.[^6] These were eventually mirrored on 22 July 2019 by Associate Judge Marita Sullivan. Motions were also filed by both Parties in the Illinois court. The Father sought to enforce the 26 November 2018 mirrored orders[^7] while the Mother sought for the Illinois court to determine a finding of jurisdiction pursuant to the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (“UCCJEA”), to vary the parenting time schedules, and for the appointment of a _Guardian Ad Litem_ for the Children. According to the Mother, the learned Associate Judge heard these Motions on 19 December 2019 and found that the Illinois court had no jurisdiction to make any orders except to enforce the mirrored orders, which the court allowed pursuant to s. 303 of the UCCJEA.[^8]

12     On 29 July 2019, the Mother filed for divorce in the Illinois court pursuant to ss. 401 and 403 of the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act. According to the Mother, the Father was served with the divorce petition.

13     The Father filed an application in FJC on 9 September 2019 for an order of committal against the Mother for continual non-compliance of various orders, including his access to the Children. This was subsequently withdrawn on 4 March 2020.

## Mother’s Applications for a Stay of Proceedings and Declaration

14     On 16 March 2020, the Mother filed the SUMs. I have reproduced the prayers and I have reflected the differences between the text of the prayers in the SUMs, where applicable:

> 1.    That all proceedings arising from and/or connected to \[OSG 230/2017 (in SUM 877/2020) and OSG 267/2017 (in SUM 878/2020)\] (including any appeals therefrom) be stayed on the ground that the United States of America, more specifically, the State of Illinois, United States of America is the more appropriate forum.

> 2.    Further or in the alternative, that proceedings herein be stayed on the grounds that Singapore is not an appropriate forum in which to determine the proceedings, and that the proceedings herein be stayed on the grounds of _forum non-conveniens_.

> **3**.     **A declaration that the Family Justice Courts of the Republic of Singapore is not a court of exclusive continuing jurisdiction for proceedings involving the parties herein;**

> 4.    That pending final disposal of this application (including any appeals therefrom), all proceedings in \[OSG 230/2017 (in SUM 877/2020) and OSG 267/2017 (in SUM 878/2020)\] be stayed and that no further action/step be taken by either party in these proceedings;

> 5.    That the \[Father\] pays the costs of this application; and

> 6.    Such further and/or other reliefs as this Honorable Court deems fit.

> \[Emphasis in bold added\]

15     During the cases conferences of the SUMs prior to the hearing on 9 July 2020, I highlighted to both sets of counsel the issues arising from the Mother’s applications for a stay of proceedings when there were no outstanding matters[^9] before the Singapore courts at that juncture. The Mother subsequently applied for the Court to first determine prayer 3 of both SUMs. Should she succeed, the Mother will apply for leave to withdraw the remaining substantive prayers.

## The Mother’s Case

16     The main thrust of the Mother’s case was that the SUMs were filed out of necessity because the Illinois court ruled that it had no jurisdiction to make any orders except to enforce the mirrored orders. See \[11\] above. This consequently affected her ability to vary the mirrored orders.

17     According to the Mother, pursuant to s. 203 of the UCCJEA, a court in the USA does not have jurisdiction to modify a child-custody determination made unless the “court of other state \[inclusive of foreign courts pursuant to S 105 of the UCCJEA\] determines it no longer has exclusive, continuing jurisdiction under Section 202 or that a court of this State would be a more convenient forum under Section 207.”[^10]

18     Further, s. 206 of the UCCJEA provides that “a court of this State may not exercise its jurisdiction under this Article if, at the time of the commencement of the proceedings, a proceeding concerning the custody of the child has been commenced in a court of another state having jurisdiction substantially in conformity with this Act, unless the proceeding has been terminated or is stayed by the court of the other state because a court of this State is a more convenient forum under Section 207 \[inconvenient forum\].”[^11] According to the Mother, the learned Associate Judge was of the view that FJC maintained exclusive, continuing jurisdiction of custody, care and control issues with regard the Children until the same is either terminated or a stay is granted on the basis of _forum non conveniens_.[^12] She also noted that the learned Associate Judge determined that Illinois met the definition of the Children’s “home state” after considering all relevant factors and that she could hear the matter if the Singapore court either terminated or stayed the proceedings in Singapore.[^13]

19     In support of her case, the Mother pointed to numerous connecting factors in favour of the USA, as opposed to Singapore. She and the children relocated to the USA on 9 October 2018 and there were contentious access incidents that took place and were being investigated in the USA. The Mother submitted that the USA is consequently the more appropriate jurisdiction, the Illinois court is clearly the more appropriate court to deal with these circumstances as the Children are in the USA, and the Illinois court is familiar with them and the proceedings.[^14] She also submitted that the Father initiated legal proceedings in Illinois and thus submitted to the jurisdiction of the USA courts.[^15] In contrast, she averred that neither party were residing in Singapore or have any assets in Singapore – the only connecting factor to Singapore is the legal proceedings. She submitted that it will be challenging or inconvenient if any orders are required to be varied or enforced in Singapore.[^16]

## The Father’s Case

20     The Father vehemently objected to the Mother’s application, including prayer 3 of both SUMs. He submitted that if the prayer was granted, it would be extremely prejudicial and inappropriate as it would essentially equate to a “blanket ban” on all further applications before the Singapore court and that there is no certainty of the impact of granting this prayer can be appropriately anticipated at this juncture given the complex issue and history between the Parties.[^17] Crucially, he characterised the Mother’s evidence and assertions in support of her application as skewed, incomplete and misleading.

21     When describing the prejudice that will ensue should the court grant the prayer sought by the Mother, the Father referred extensively to:

> (a)     the conduct of the Mother in attaining their children’s passports prematurely;

> (b)     his concern that he will not have a future opportunity to raise committal or enforcement proceedings against the Mother in Singapore;

> (c)     the Mother’s failure to provide him with important updates relating to the Children;

> (d)     the Mother’s presentation of inaccurate facts concerning the legal separation in Norway; and

> (e)     his concern that the Illinois and Norway courts may not be able to appropriately interpret/apply the prayers as intended by the Singapore court.

22     According to the Father, the Mother was engaging in “jurisdiction shopping” and her true agenda is to have the Illinois court exercise jurisdiction to set aside the access rights granted to him or at the very least deny these access rights for an extended period.[^18]

23     Further, the Father submitted that he was unable to provide a full position in advance of the hearing of the Mother’s application because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. He claimed that he was unable to communicate and attain complete views from his overseas solicitors with respect to the position and assertions detailed by the Mother. He consequently asked for a reasonable amount of time to provide the court with further evidence in response to the Mother’s assertions and positions.

## Decision

24     Having considered the Mother’s affidavit and the Father’s draft affidavit, I was of the view that the specific prayer sought by the Mother was an accurate description of the circumstances before me and it was a reasonable request. I was however mindful of the non-static nature of family court orders and made the following order which departed from what was prayed for:

> The Family Justice Courts of the Republic of Singapore is not a court of exclusive continuing jurisdiction for proceedings involving the parties herein **unless there are material changes in circumstances of which the Court is unaware**.

> \[Emphasis in bold added and tracks the text that differed from what was prayed for\]

25     The sole issue before me was whether FJC is the court of exclusive continuing jurisdiction. Clearly it was not. In addition to and after the proceedings commenced in Singapore, the Mother commenced divorce proceedings in the Illinois court and the Father commenced legal separation proceedings in Norway. The existence of these proceedings was not cast in doubt by either party. The Father himself claimed that Norway is the appropriate jurisdiction for issues related to the divorce. I note that while it was not expressly made clear in the Father’s evidence whether the Norwegian proceedings has jurisdiction over the Children’s care issues, it presumptively appeared so because the Father himself took issue that the Mother did not attempt to re-litigate access orders in that forum.[^19]

26     Crucially, whilst the Father raised strong concerns in his draft affidavit over the prayer sought by the Mother, he did not supply any cogent reason or evidence whatsoever as to why FJC _is_ the court of exclusive continuing jurisdiction for proceedings involving the Parties. As a result of both Parties’ initiation of multi-jurisdiction litigation over their dispute, FJC was clearly no longer the court of exclusive continuing jurisdiction. The Father complained that he did not have sufficient time to make representations on Illinois law. He also outlined his concern that the Illinois and Norway courts may not be able to appropriately interpret or apply the prayers as intended by the Singapore court. However, in my view, such submissions or evidence on foreign law were not material to the determination of the specific prayer sought by the Mother and I was also not making any finding whatsoever on the issue of whether the Illinois court or the Norway court is the more appropriate forum. The Father should have focused his efforts on submissions on the issue before the court – whether FJC was the exclusive continuing jurisdiction – which he had more than ample time and opportunity to make with counsel from Singapore. He glaringly did not do so.

27     Instead of focusing on the issue before the court, the Father invested a significant portion of his response into numerous allegations against the Mother’s conduct in relation to the Children’s care issues and his concern over the possible need to enforce the orders made by the Singapore court against the Mother. I was of the view that the Father’s allegations pertaining to the Mother’s non-compliance of orders made by the Singapore court are valid concerns, if true. However, making the declaration sought by the Mother does not deprive him of applying for enforcement in the Singapore court in the future. Similarly, there is nothing preventing the Parties from applying to the Singapore court in the future to vary its orders.

28     I was nevertheless cognisant that there could be a material change in the Parties’ or Children’s circumstances in the future which could render invalid the declaration made. As such, I was of the view that the declaration should be appropriately drafted to cater for such a possibility, and I added the bold text reflected in \[24\] above.

## Conclusion

29     As the Mother succeeded in the sole issue before the court, she sought leave to withdraw all remaining prayers save for costs. I granted her leave to do so. Her counsel submitted for $1,500 in costs as a result of unnecessary costs incurred. The Father’s counsel submitted for the court to make no order as to costs since the Father also embarked on substantive work for the applications and did try to engage in discussions to resolve the matter amicably as far as he could. I was of the view that the Father’s attempt to resolve matters deserved some credit and I noted that his counsel left the decision on the declaration to the court. Because of this reasonable conduct, I made no order as to costs.

30     It is regretful that the Parties’ have engaged in cross-border litigation for several years. The amount of financial and emotional resources expended in waging this battle have no doubt been significant. I strongly invite the Parties to revaluate their actions and I encourage them to reach an amicable resolution so that they can regain some peace not only in their own lives, but for their Children’s lives as well. Otherwise, the Parties risk being further consumed by their differences and cause collateral irreparable harm to their Children’s future.
