Ancillary Matters – 12-year marriage – childless marriage – division of matrimonial assets – maintenance of wife

24 February 2021

### District Judge Geraldine Kang:

## Brief Background

1       For ease of reference, parties shall be referred to Plaintiff Husband (55 years old) and Defendant Wife (40 years old) in this written grounds of decision.

2       Briefly, parties were married on 11 November 2007 and interim judgement was granted on 30 May 2019, making the length of this marriage approximately 12 years. This was a second marriage for the Husband.

3       The Husband left the matrimonial home sometime in February 2017 and commenced divorce proceedings against the Wife sometime in October 2018, which were resolved on the Wife’s counterclaim.

4       As there were no children born to the union, the only issue for this Court’s determination were financial ones.

5       The Husband was employed as an airline captain, whereas the Wife was employed as a customer relationship coordinator with a trading company. Based on their respective 2019 Notice of Assessment, their average gross monthly salary was approximately:

> (a)     Husband : $27,356

> (b)     Wife : $6613.50

6       Both parties were represented at the commencement of these hearings, but the Husband subsequently discharge his counsel and chose to act in person.

7       Having heard parties and the evidence in this matter, a summary of my orders is set out as follows:

> a.      **Matrimonial Home** @ xxx Flora Drive #xxx Singapore xxx, to be retained solely by the Husband, however, the Husband is to allow the Wife to continue residing at the Matrimonial Home until an additional 3 months from the official Temporary Occupation Permit of the Grandeur Park Residences. For the avoidance of doubt, the Husband is to continue to pay for the mortgage and related MCST charges whereas the Wife will pay for the utilities incurred whilst she resides in the Matrimonial Home.

> b.     The **Grandeur Park Residences** to be retained by the Wife in her sole name.

> c.     The **Penang Apartment** @ Unit No. xxx Pangsapuri Delima to be retained by the Wife in her sole name. The Husband shall pre-sign any and all documents that are necessary to effect the sale and/or redemption of the Penang Apartment within 7 days of written request being made.

> d.     The **Australian Property** @ xxx Claremont St, Australia, to be retained by the Husband his sole name. The Wife shall pre-sign any and all documents that are necessary to effect the sale and/or redemption of the Australian property within 7 days of written request being made.

> e.     Husband to pay the Wife a lump sum maintenance of $1000 per month for 5 years i.e. $60,000. Such payment is to be made in 2 equal instalments of $30,000 each by 31 December 2020 and 30 June 2021.

> f.     Pursuant to Section 112 of the Women’s Charter, the Wife shall be entitled to $200,000 of the Husband’s CPF monies in his ordinary account.

> g.     Each party to retain their own assets in their own names.

> h.     Each party to bear their own costs.

8       The Husband is now appealing against my decision.

## (1)   Division of Matrimonial Assets - The Law

9       The law relating to the power of the court to order division of matrimonial assets is stipulated in Section 112 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353):

> (_1_)     _The court shall have power, when granting or subsequent to the grant of a judgement of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage, to order the division between the parties of any matrimonial asset or the sale of any such asset and the division between the parties of the proceeds of the sale of any such asset in such proportions as the court thinks just and equitable._

> (_2_)     _It shall be the duty of the court in deciding whether to exercise its power under subsection (1) and, if so, in what manner, to have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the following matters:_

>> (_a_)     _the extent of the contributions made by each party in money, property or work towards acquiring, improving or maintaining the matrimonial assets;_

>> (_b_)     _any debt owing or obligation incurred or undertaken by either party for their joint benefit or for the benefit of any child of the marriage;_

>> (_c_)     _the needs of the children (if any);_

>> (_d_)     _the extent of contributions made by each party to the welfare of the family, including looking after the home or caring for the family or any aged or infirm relative or dependant of either party;_

>> (_e_)     _any agreement between the parties with respect to the ownership and division of the matrimonial assets made in contemplation of divorce;_

>> (_f_)     _any period of rent-free occupation or other benefit enjoyed by one party in the matrimonial home to the exclusion of the other party;_

>> (_g_)     _the giving of assistance or support by one party to the other party (whether or not of a material kind), including the giving of assistance or support which aids the other party in the carrying on of his or her occupation or business; and_

>> (_h_)     _the matters referred to in section 114(1) so far as they are relevant._

10     The Court of Appeal in _ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span> gave guidance in relation to the structured approach for the division of assets under which courts will first ascribe a ratio that represents each party’s direct financial contributions towards the acquisitions of the matrimonial assets, relative to that of the other party. Next, the court will ascribe a second ratio which represents each parties’ indirect contribution to the well-being of the family. If the necessary, the court has a discretion to make further adjustments to this average ratio after taking into account the other factors set out in s 112(2) of the Women’s Charter as well as all relevant circumstances to arrive at a just and equitable division of the matrimonial assets.

## (2)   The Matrimonial Pool and its Division

11     The following summary sets out the main assets which were disputed by parties.

## (3)   Power of court to order maintenance

12     The law relating to the power of the court to order maintenance and the assessment of such maintenance is found in sections 113 and Section 114 (Cap. 353).

>      Section 113

> (_1_)     _The court may order a man to pay maintenance to his wife or former wife, or order a woman to pay maintenance to her incapacitated husband or incapacitated former husband –_

>> (_a_)     _during the course of any matrimonial proceedings, or_

>> (_b_)     _when granting or subsequent to the grant of a judgement of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage._

>      Section 114

> (_1_)     _In determining the amount of any maintenance to be paid by a man to his wife or former wife, or by a woman to her incapacitated husband or incapacitated former husband, the court shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the following matters:_

>> (_a_)     _the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;_

>> (_b_)     _the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;_

>> (_c_)     _the standard of living enjoyed by the family before the breakdown of the marriage;_

>> (_d_)     _the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage;_

>> (_e_)     _any physical or mental disability of either of the parties to the marriage;_

>> (_f_)     _the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family; and_

>> (_g_)     _in the case of proceedings for divorce or nullity of marriage, the value to either of the parties to the marriage of any benefit (for example, a pension) which, by reason of the dissolution or annulment of the marriage that party will lose the chance of acquiring._

> (_2_)     _In exercising its powers under this section, the court shall endeavour so to place the parties, so far as it is practicable and, having regard to their conduct, just to do so, in the financial position in which they would have been if the marriage had not broken down and each had properly discharged his or her financial obligations and responsibilities towards the other._

13     The Court of Appeal in _ATE v ATD_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGCA 2</span> enunciated and reiterated the principle of awarding maintenance to an ex-spouse. In summary, the underlying rationale and purpose for the award of maintenance generally to former wives was that of **_financial preservation at a standard of living that she enjoyed during the marriage_**. It was also observed with approval that an award of maintenance for a former wife takes into account the fact that a former wife ought to try to regain self-sufficiency and that **_an order of maintenance is not intended to create life-long dependency on the former husband_**.

**_\[my emphasis\]_**

## (4)   The Wife’s Case

14     The Wife sought to claim a monthly maintenance sum of $800 as well as some other car related expenses. In respect of the division of the matrimonial assets, she pegged her case mostly at indirect non-financial contributions towards the acquisition of these assets, save for the 2 immovable properties she held in her sole names.

15     Prior to marriage, the Wife was a flight stewardess. Parties had met sometime in April 2001 on the same flight. At that time, the Husband was separated from his first wife. Parties then began romantically involved and cohabited at Flora Drive since February 2003 and got married on 11 November 2007.

16     In August 2002, the Wife quit but decided to rejoin the airline in 2005; only to quit for the second time in May 2006. From 2009 to 2012, the Wife joined the automobile industry as a car sales-person. Whilst the Wife has been gainfully employed during the course of their marriage, her understanding was that her jobs were merely to pass time and not meant to be a source of income as the Husband did not wish for her to work full time and wanted her to be home for him when he was not flying. In addition, she had to stay home to take care of the family pet dog which was adopted in 2003.

17     In June 2012, the Wife ceased working at the Husband’s insistence as he was unhappy that she was not spending enough time with him and thus discouraged her from working. The Husband paid for the household expenses, provided a car for her and gave her a monthly allowance of $2000.

18     After consulting with the Husband, the Wife returned to the workforce from August 2014 and continues to work to-date, as she felt insecure about her own future.

19     Sometime in February 2017, the Husband left the matrimonial home unilaterally. To-date, the Wife continues to reside there. The Husband continues to pay for the mortgage but has ceased his contribution towards the household utilities and her allowance from May 2018.

## (5)   Other related proceedings: Section 69 (Cap. 353) – Maintenance Order

20     The Wife took out an application under Section 69 (Cap. 353) after the Husband left the matrimonial home in February 2017 and subsequently ceased giving her the monthly $2000 allowance from May 2018.

21     A consent order was reached wherein the Husband was to pay the Wife $800 monthly maintenance. The Husband allegedly ceased these monthly payments just before the conclusion of these hearings; however, he fully redeemed and paid up the outstanding loan (of approximately $8,888.51) on the car that the Wife was driving.

## (6)   The Husband’s Case

22     Parties met sometime in April 2001 on the same flight schedule and began dating at the beginning of 2002.

23     The decision to quit being an air stewardess on both occasions was the Wife’s sole decision as she was not content with being a “waitress in the air”, and not in any way influenced by the Husband. The Husband contends that on both those occasions when the Wife left the airline industry, they were merely in “boyfriend-girlfriend” relationship at that time and it was a major career decision she undertook on her own volition.

24     After parties got married in 2007, the Wife was entitled a fringe benefit of premium class air travel as part of the Husband’s pilot employee entitlement scheme. According to the Husband, from 2007 to 2009, the Wife did not work and spent her time living out her “tai-tai” fantasy travelling with the Husband. She only resumed working in April 2009 after she was bored of this life.

25     The Husband had wanted to start a family of their own but soon realised that the Wife did not share the same aspirations, as she did not wish to be burdened with childbearing nor child-rearing. Instead, the Wife proposed that they adopt her 12-year old nephew.

26     When the Husband appeared in person, he was at pains to highlight and emphasize to the Court that during the course of the marriage he paid for everything such that the Wife did not have to utilize her own income for anything. The Husband did not dispute the fact that during the marriage, he not only gave the Wife a monthly allowance of $2000, he further paid for the mortgage on the matrimonial home, the utilities and all other household expenses, gave the wife usage of his supplementary credit cards, bought her a car in her own name and took care of all car related expenses as well. His case was that he paid for everything such that the Wife was able to keep her entire income for herself without spending any of it such that she was able to acquire 2 properties in her sole name on a salary that was a fifth of his.

27     The Husband maintained that there was no need for an order of maintenance to be made in her favour, as she was clearly self-sufficient and progressing very well in her career; whereas he was employed in an industry that was greatly hit by the Covid19 global pandemic. His income was most certainly affected adversely and was facing the prospect of retrenchment.

28     In respect of the division of the matrimonial assets, the Husband’s Counsel submitted that his direct financial contributions far outweighed the Wife’s; and that even on the indirect contribution front, the Wife was hardly at home to spend time with him nor take care of the household (including the pet dog she insisted on adopting) as she was busy furthering her chosen career.

## (7)   The Court’s Findings and Decision

29     This was a long marriage albeit without any children. Parties did enjoy a relatively comfortable standard of living and it was undoubtedly due to the financial ability and generosity of the Husband.

#### Matrimonial Home

30     This was his second marriage – comingled funds from the sale proceeds of the first matrimonial home – but it is not disputed that Flora Drive was the matrimonial home of this marriage notwithstanding the fact that it was purchased in his sole name and that it was purchased before their marriage.

31     It was not disputed that the Matrimonial Home / Flora Drive was purchased sometime in 2002, which was approximately 5 years before parties were married and it was in the Husband’s sole name. The Husband was solely responsible for the down payment and the subsequent installments throughout and even for the periods after he left the home and until the present proceedings. The Husband submitted that this was not intended to be the matrimonial home as it was purchased soon after he was separated from his first wife and had no intention of remarrying at that time, but the fact that parties had indeed resided in the home _after_ they got married in 2007 did make this the parties matrimonial home, to which the Wife was entitled to seek a division of. The issue to be determined was then, what was to be an equitable division? The Wife was not arguing any direct financial contribution to it but premised her case on indirect contributions to it. In fact, she was not seeking a division of it but in light of parties’ other assets, she was seeking that she be allowed to reside in the Matrimonial Home (rent free) until such time that Grandeur Park Residences was ready for her to move into.

#### Penang Apartment

32     It was not disputed that the Penang Apartment was purchased in 2013 in her sole name, with both parties named as joint mortgagors. However, the background and context as to how the Penang Apartment was purchased was highlighted by the Husband. The Husband claimed that as the Wife is a Malaysian and wanted to own a property in her hometown, she persuaded him to look into purchasing a property in Malaysia which could also serve as their retirement home. The initial property that they considered was a landed one and it was to be purchased in their joint names. As the Husband did not have a Malaysian bank account, he transferred a sum of S$56,910 to the Wife who then transferred it to her Malaysian Bank account to complete the conveyancing process in Malaysia. Unfortunately, the seller pulled out of the transaction. Subsequently, the Wife committed to purchase the Penang Apartment against the advice of the Husband and had the Penang Apartment registered in her sole name as the local laws did not allow the Husband to be a joint owner. The Wife was not able to obtain a mortgage loan on her own and the Husband had to be a guarantor to it.

33     The Wife claimed that the direct financial contributions towards the Penang Apartment was entirely hers as a result of her own savings / funds. However, the Wife remained silent on the context and background of this purchase and did not refute the Husband’s claim that he transferred a sum of S$56,910 towards the intended purchase of a previous Malaysian property.

34     It was not disputed the Wife services the monthly mortgage of the Penang Apartment on her own, for which it is currently vacant. There was a short period for which it was rented out but the rental was insufficient to cover the monthly mortgage and thus, the Wife was making plans to sell the property.

#### Grandeur Park Residences

35     Grandeur Park Residences was a 1-bedroom unit which the Wife purchased in March 2017 after Husband had left the matrimonial home in February 2017. The Wife made the payments on her own, using a combination of her cash savings and CPF monies; with the balance secured through a UOB mortgage in her sole name. The Wife claims that this property was purchased in anticipation of the breakdown of the marriage and that there was a promised by the Husband to pay for it in full so that she would have a roof over her head after the divorce, although this was denied by the Husband.

36     It was technically a matrimonial asset as it was purchased during the marriage. However, I was unable to agree with the Husband that he had any direct financial contribution towards it by virtue of his monthly allowances to the Wife. I also did not think it was then fair or right for the Husband to make a claim under a direct financial contributions towards this properties. The Husband’s counsel was also not able to produce any legal authority in support of this argument. On the facts, I was minded to exclude it from the matrimonial pool as the acquisition of this purchase was made after the marriage between parties had broken down and there was clearly no joint consultation nor efforts towards this acquisition. In fairness to the Husband, I saw no reason also to make him financially responsible for the full payment of this property – the Wife produced no evidence either in a form of a deed of separation or post nuptial agreement to this effect that the Husband would pay for it in full so that she would have a roof over her head after the divorce.

37     On the whole, the Husband could not argue that “But for my allowances towards her, she would not have been able to purchase these 2 immovable properties in her sole name, thus my allowances to her should now be regarded as my direct financial contributions towards these properties for which I am now staking a claim on”. In my opinion, what he could submit and persuade the Court was that without his financial support, the Wife would not have been able to accumulate such assets that she has in her sole name, which the Court should take into consideration when deciding the issue of her maintenance as these assets were clearly a financial resource of hers; or in the alternative, the Court should consider his indirect contributions towards these assets which she held in her sole name. It was a fallacy or a leap in logic for him to argue that his allowances should translate to a direct share in these assets. How the Wife chose to invest or manage the allowances given to her was a matter of personal choice, prudence and discernment. Had she chosen to splurge it on weekly retail therapy or fine dining, or purchasing spa / facial packages, or even making investments that went south, would the Husband then be alleging he had a direct interests in those as well or that he would offer to take on the liability of those bad investments? I think not. Due credit and recognition ought to be given to her for making astute investments by putting the allowances and maintenance she had towards the purchase of properties (instead of other material goods).

38     Whilst the Husband was not able to provide documentary proof of his direct payments towards the Penang Apartment and Grandeur Park Residences, it cannot be disputed also that his monthly income, earning capacity as well his savings (by virtue of his age compared to the Wife’s – he was 15 years older than her) would have made him the financially stronger party in this marriage. It would be inconceivable for the Wife to assert that she acquired these 2 properties entirely on her own without any form of financial support or contribution from the Husband.

#### Australian Property

39     The Australian Property was purchased in joint names sometime in 2016 and it was not disputed that the Husband had placed the deposit of AUD51,850. The project had to be aborted and the deposit was to be refunded to parties. The Wife was agreeable that the deposit be refunded to the Husband in full, but that this sum was to be added to the matrimonial pool of assets to be divided.

40     I accepted that the lifestyle that the Wife enjoyed over a relatively long period of marriage, such as the premium air travel and the holidays were part of the husband’s perks and incentives that came with his employment as a pilot captain. It may not be reasonable to sustain this standard of living of premium class travel on overseas holidays simply because it was enjoyed previously as part of his employment benefits for his spouse.

41     Having considered the totality of the evidence and the circumstances, this was a long childless marriage and thus it would be appropriate for a “clean break”. I recognised that the Husband was employed in an industry that was undeniably affected by a global pandemic, but his ability to meet the financial orders imposed by my orders were within his means even after considering the current situation.

42     Adopting the spirit of _ATE v ATD_ – and also in seeking a achieve a fair and reasonable outcome on the facts of this case – I ordered the transfer of $200,000 from the Husband’s CPF Ordinary Account to the Wife’s Ordinary Account as a reflection of her share of the matrimonial assets and allowed her to retain the 2 immovable properties in her sole names. With this transfer to her CPF, she can also utilise this sum towards Grandeur Park Residences or her next intended abode post-divorce.

43     The intent behind my orders was not to divide the Husband’s CPF monies _per se_ as I recognised that not only has the Husband been working longer by virtue of his 15 year seniority and prior to marriage, there was co-mingling of funds into his CPF account that would have come from the sale of his former matrimonial property from his first marriage – thus, a significant sum of the Husband’s CPF monies could have been accumulated prior to marriage. But having considered the circumstances and in deciding to adopt a broad-brush approach, I was of the opinion that a transfer of $200,000 from the Husband’s CPF account to the Wife’s CPF ordinary account was be a fair and equitable one in relation to the division of assets that would also be a practical one that would also allow parties to move on separately and independently.

44     After taking into account the full redemption of the car loan on the car that the Wife was driving, and that the car was retained by her for her sole usage, I find that a sum of $1000 per month as her maintenance for 5 years was a reasonable one. Given her ambition and drive to succeed in her chosen career, and having shown the ability to improve and better her career prospects, 5 years was certainly a reasonable period for her to regain self-sufficiency. And this was also a reasonable time frame for her to manage the 2 immovable properties in her name, whether it was to liquidate and keep it for rental income.

45     Accordingly, I made the orders I did and that each party were to bear their own costs.
