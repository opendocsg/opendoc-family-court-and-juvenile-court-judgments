Custody care and control of minor children – maintenance for the wife and for the children – division of matrimonial assets

20 January 2020

### District Judge Jen Koh:

## Brief background

1       The Plaintiff shall be referred to as the “husband” and the Defendant shall be referred to as the “wife”.

2       The parties were married on xx July 2011 and they have 2 children, a daughter aged about 4 and a son aged about 2 years old (‘the children’). The husband is about 47 years of age and is a Barrister/Mediator/Arbitrator. The wife is about 37 years of age and she also has a law degree as well as a Masters in Law. She is a director of a handmade chocolate company. The husband is the other director and the parties hold the shares equally. The parties are citizens of the United Kingdom (‘UK’) with the husband holding dual citizenship with Australia and the wife holding dual citizenship in Ireland.

3       The parties relocated to Singapore in February 2012, some 6 months after their marriage. The parties have lived in Singapore since February 2012 save for the occasional holidays back to the UK. The parties are permanent residents of Singapore and the children are on Long Term Social Visit Passes (‘LTSVP’). This family has resided in Singapore some 7 years and 7 months from February 2012 to October 2019.

4       According to the husband, cracks appeared in the marriage in 2014 and again in 2016 with issues pertaining to physical intimacy in mid-2018. He filed for divorce in July 2018.

## Litigation history

5       The wife filed divorce proceedings in the UK on 26 June 2018. The husband commenced divorce proceedings in Singapore on 9 July 2018. The wife applied to stay the divorce proceedings in Singapore but her application was dismissed on 28 January 2019. Interim judgement on the Singapore divorce proceedings was granted on 5 March 2019. The wife consented to the Interim Judgment. The parties could not advise the status of the UK divorce proceedings: the husband stayed it had been stayed whilst the wife said the proceedings were pending. In any event, as the wife’s application to stay the divorce proceedings had failed, the parties proceeded with the divorce and the ensuing ancillary matters in Singapore.

6       On 9 November 2018, the wife filed an application to relocate permanently to the UK with the children. The application was dismissed on 26 March 2019. The wife appealed the orders but the appeal lapsed as she took no steps in the proceedings after the release of my grounds of decision (see _UXR v UXS_ \[2019\] SGFC68).

7       In December 2018, the wife filed 2 applications for personal protection orders (‘PPO’); one for herself, the other on behalf of the children. The matters were fixed for trial before me and I dismissed both applications on 14 March 2019.

8       The husband filed an application for interim access to the children on an urgent basis on 28 December 2018. No orders were made on that application when it came on for a case conference on 8 January 2019.

9       The ancillary matters (‘AM’) came on for hearing before me on 16 and 19 September 2019. I reserved decision and delivered the AM orders on 8 October 2019 with clarifications on 9 and 14 October 2019:

10     The husband also filed a summons for a stay of the AM orders pending the appeal. I heard the parties on 13 November 2019 and save for the consent by the wife to stay the division of the matrimonial assets, I dismissed the husband’s application. The husband has renewed the stay application in the High Court Family Division.

11     I now set out the reasons for the AM decision.

## Custody, care and control and access

### The wife’s position on custody care and control

12     The wife proposed joint custody with care and control to herself and terms of access to the husband.

#### Terms of access proposed by the wife

13     Her terms of access was one in which the husband would have one weekday and one weekend overnight access alternated with another week of one overnight access on the weekdays (additional night) and one weekend overnight access (unchanged). She also proposed access on alternate public holidays save that she would have Christmas and the husband specific Jewish holidays. She wanted the children to be with her during her birthday and for the parties to alternate access on the children’s birthdays.

14     She proposed to facilitate telephone or video call between the husband and the children as and when the husband was travelling.

15     With effect from July 2019, she proposed that the husband be entitled to travel with the children for an aggregate of 21 days each year save that his overseas access with the children was not to exceed more than 4 consecutive days for each trip and up to 7 consecutive days if he was travelling to Australia to visit his family. If the husband intended to travel for more than 7 consecutive days, then the wife proposed to accompany the children and for the children to spend intermittent time with her during the trip. She also proposed that the husband bear her costs of travel.

16     As for her overseas travel, she proposed to travel with the children to the UK once a year for a period of 3 weeks.

17     For overseas travels, parties to furnish the requisite notice to each other with details of flights, accommodations and other contact details.

#### The wife’s arguments/submissions

18     The wife raised the following matters in her submission with regard the issues of care and control and access:

> (a)     The husband’s combative behaviour and his acrimonious conduct in the proceedings eg unilateral deductions of maintenance amounts, cancelling the children’s enrichment classes without discussions with her, removing items of furniture from the former matrimonial home and behaving in a hostile and aggressive manner with her in the children’s presence.

> (b)     The husband’s work hours and travel schedule. The husband is a barrister and maintains a practice in London. He is an arbitrator and has been regularly appointed by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre, International Chamber of Commerce and London Court of International Arbitration. The wife said that the husband also attends courses and presents and/or lectures at seminars and conferences. Because of his heavy work schedule, his care of the children has been minimal.

> (c)     She disagreed that he has a flexible work schedule such that he could work from home. She submitted that he was uninvolved in the children’s lives and that he did not know their friends or the parents. She referred to affidavits filed by third parties corroborating her claim.

> (d)     Although the husband agreed to an order for joint custody, he included a proviso that in the event of a disagreement, the decision to be undertaken was then to be made by him solely. She submitted that this position reflected his unreasonableness and that his stance was inimical to the concept of joint parenting.

> (e)     The wife submitted that the parties agreed she would be the children’s primary caregiver. There was a dispute between the parties as to when she would return to the workforce but nonetheless the wife continued to stay home to care for the children and she thus submitted this was a recognition of the fact that she is the children’s caregiver.

> (f)     She used to have the assistance of a foreign domestic worker (FDW) but this ceased from June 2019 and she has been managing the children and the housework without assistance (the husband had moved out when acrimony had escalated with the onset of the various proceedings).

> (g)     The husband’s case for care and control included the hiring of a FDW. The wife said this meant that he would be possibly reliant on a third party to care for the children especially given his long working hours. She submitted this should not be preferred to the current care and control arrangements.

> (h)     The wife submitted that his work schedules meant that she had to take full responsibility of the children during those times and as such, the emotional bond and attachment between the children and herself were stronger _vis a vis_ the husband.

19     In summary, the wife’s case was one of continuity of care as she has always been the children’s primary caregiver and the children are both very young. She submitted that it was necessary to maintain stability for them; that they should not be subjected to a new care arrangement with the husband who has a full work schedule and who would likely delegate the caregiving to a FDW.

#### The wife’s reply to the husband’s claim for care and control

20     As for the husband’s case for care and control, the wife raised the following matters:

> (a)     With regard to his specific allegations of alienation by the wife, she set out her position and replies at pages 21 to 33 of DS1. The incidents relate largely to access arrangements in which the husband claimed she was obstructive and/or renege on agreements for access. The wife denied the allegations and submitted that the husband’s version of events was skewed. The incidents included: not allowing the husband to give the parties’ son his first haircut in contravention of the Jewish custom and knowing the religious significance importance; reneging on an agreement for the husband to visit his family in Australia without her; refusal to facilitate telephone access; refusing to agree to additional access time for the husband with the children. The wife said that there were many misunderstandings between the both of them.

> (b)     She disagreed with the husband’s proposal on access if she was not vested with care and control. The husband’s proposal meant that she would not have overnight access with the children.

> (c)     She submitted that the husband did not have experience with the children’s care and that the children fall ill under his care during access, that he did not know their sleeping patterns or their routines and that his job required him to travel making him unsuitable as a day to day carer.

> (d)     The husband had taken great lengths to state that he was a hands on father but he subsequently engaged a FDW. The wife submitted that he had relegated the care of the children to the FDW to the extent that he required the FDW to pick the children up from after school hours when he had previously claimed that he was able to manage the children on his own and criticized the wife for her dependence on the parties’ previous FDW.

> (e)     She also submitted that it was difficult co-operating with him and cited an example of the lack of discussions between them about his unilateral wish to apply for Australian citizenship for the children.

21     For the reasons set out above, she proposed as set out in paragraphs 12 to 17 above.

### The husband’s position on custody care and control

22     The husband agreed that the prevailing legal principles was what was in the children’s best interests.

23     He submitted that whilst joint custody was the norm, a proviso was required, in the short time, to the effect that after parties discussed an issue and were unable to agree, he would have the final say. He said this was required because he had furnished examples that the wife consistently put her interests ahead of the children’s in respect of matters involving schooling, religion and place of residence. If this proviso was not put in place, he submitted that the parties would return to Court because of the disagreements. As it was, parties were unable to decide the issue of school for the children when they reached the age of formal schooling.

24     The husband submitted that he should be granted care and control for the following reasons:

> (a)     That the children would have to attend local primary schools and that he would need to have care and control in order for him to apply permanent residence status for the children as only a parent with care and control could be able to sponsor the children’s residency status in Singapore.

> (b)     That the wife’s unrealistic living expenses would mean that she could not live in Singapore whereas he would be able to maintain the family with a plan which would enable them to live well in Singapore.

> (c)     That the wife could not be trusted with finances and that she had incurred a mountain of debts eg student loans, overdrafts and that she depended on the husband to climb out of the financial abyss. When the marriage broke down, within a year, the wife had chalked up more than $350,000 in debts. This financial mismanagement on her part made her ineffective as a parent: she was in dent, had no savings, no assets and had not attempted to return to work to make an income to make an inroad into the mountain of debts. She was financially irresponsible and this would impact her care of the children.

> (d)     That the wife could not be trusted to act morally and thus would not be setting a good example for the children. He cited examples such as her lying in Court or giving false evidence, that she had defamed him on several occasions and even made false declarations on official forms bordering on fraudulent behaviour, and that she commenced proceedings with little chance of success, for collateral purposes.

> (e)     That the wife did not act in the children’s best interests when she took video clips of the children discussing their access with him and then relying on these clips to curtail his access. This conduct showed that she did not have the children’s best interests at heart.

25     The husband submitted that the wife had tried to alienate the children from him, that she was not willing to discuss children issues with him, that she was unnecessarily obstructive when it came to issues of additional contact time with the children especially when his extended family visited Singapore.

26     Given that both parties were in a position to care for the children, on a balance, he submitted that he would be the better parent to have care and control. He set out in PWS (his written submissions) his proposals for the wife’s access at pages 74 to 76. He also submitted that the wife should not be allowed to travel with the children as she was a flight risk. The wife had filed an application for relocation which was disallowed by this Court. The husband said that the wife had no ties to Singapore, that she had massive debts which she could escape from by not returning to Singapore if granted overseas travel with the children

## Court’s decision on the children issues

#### The concept of joint parenting

27     In deciding in whose custody care and control a child should be placed, the paramount consideration shall be the welfare of the child and subject to that, the Court shall have regard to the wishes of the parents and to the wishes of the child where he or she is of an age to express an independent opinion. The Court can also makes orders with conditions (see Sections 125 and 126 of the Women’s Charter Cap 353).

28     Both parties have agreed to an order for joint custody. This is sensible and falls in line with leading and seminal decisions pertaining to the importance of joint parenting. In _CX v CY (minor: custody and access)_ \[2005\] 3 SLR (R) 690 at paragraph 24, the Court of Appeal pointed out that acrimony alone was not sufficient to justify a sole custody order. The Court is enjoined to give effect to the highly significant concept of joint parenting and the Court of Appeal also went on to state that sound and effective parenting is best achieved when both parents are involved.

#### The husband’s proviso

29     That being the case, I could not agree with the husband’s proposition that whilst he had no objections to a joint custody order, as a proviso to that, he sought an order in the short term if parties were unable to agree on a matter, he should have the right to decide alone. The proviso effectively extinguishes the wife’s joint parenting ability and is tantamount to granting his sole custodial rights. Given the many disagreements these parties have highlighted, it would be simple enough for the husband to rely on the proviso, cite the wife’s inability to agree with him and consequently make a decision for the children arbitrarily. This would be inimical to the concept of joint parenting.

30     I also appointed a Parenting Co-ordinator (PC) to assist the parties through this difficult transitional period. Parties’ emotions are still raw and there is undoubtedly still a high degree of animosity given the divorce and the many allegations set out in the affidavits. I was of the view that a third party would be able to assist them transcend their personal emotiveness caused by the breakdown of the marriage to progress into thinking past themselves as individuals and to considering what is best for their children as the children’s parents. The husband-wife relationship no longer subsists; but these parties remain parents for life.

31     Given that appointment, the husband’s proviso was all the more unnecessary and in any event, incongruent to joint parenting as remarked earlier.

#### Care and control

32     I did not grant care and control to the husband as prayed for by him. After considering the evidence and ploughing through the affidavits, I did not hold the view that his reasons were compelling enough to warrant a change to the children’s care regime. Many of the reasons raised by him pertained to the wife’s conduct eg that she could not manage her finances, that she did not behave morally, that she lied under oath and that she had demonstrated that she could not act in the children’s best interests with her litigation tactics and that she could not co-parent with him. He also submitted that he needed to have care and control in order to register the children in local schools.

33     I have no doubt that both parties love their children deeply and want the best for them. In considering with which parent to place their care with, the underlying principle is still the welfare principle. The word ‘welfare’ has been discussed in _Soon Peck Wah v Woon Che Chye_ \[1997\] 3 SLR (R) 736 which adopted an English academic description of the “welfare of the child” in _Rayden and Jackson on Divorce and Family Matters (16_th_ed. 1991)_ at 1004:

> _“The word ‘welfare’ must be taken in its widest sense. It has been said that the welfare of the child is not to be measured by money only nor by physical comfort only; the moral and religious welfare of the child must be considered as well as his physical well-being; nor can the ties of affection be disregarded. The rights and wishes of parents must be assessed and weighed in their bearing on the welfare of the child in conjunction with all other factors relative to that issue. The question for the judge is not what the essential justice of the case requires but what the best interests of the child require…”_

34     Taken in that context, there are several factors that must be considered and considered holistically in determining what then is in these children’s best interests. I considered, amongst other factors, the alternatives each parent offered in terms of caregiving, continuity of care and the fact that the children are of ‘tender’ years. Whilst there is consideration for the maternal bond, this must also be given its appropriate consideration and weighed against the facts of each individual case. Plainly speaking, the maternal bond is not an overriding factor but one of many composite factors that are to be considered in determining what was in these children’s best interests.

35     Notwithstanding the fact that the husband submitted that the wife was supposed to return to the workforce, the facts of the case are these: the wife is a stay-home mom and she has care of the children on a day to day basis. There is no allegation that the children are suffering in any way either emotionally or physically under the wife’s care and she remains their day to day caregiver. There is no persuasive evidence before me that the wife is an unsuitable caregiver or that she could not continue to care for these young children.

36     The husband’s allegations of her indebtedness or financial mismanagement of her monies were explained by the wife to be caused by legal bills or what she said were inadequate maintenance. The husband’s allegations about her alleged character defects eg lying under oath or making untrue claims have also been denied and in any event, must be taken into context given the volatile litigation history of this couple. These allegations of themselves did not make her unsuitable as a caregiver.

37     On the other hand, I considered the fact that the husband is a full time lawyer. He said that he works 10 days in a month but that does not dispel the conclusion that he works and that the family depends on his income. He also travels as a consequence of his appointment as arbitrator. The husband said that there was no evidence tendered as to his travel commitments but he did not reply to the submission by the wife that he did travel and that for 2018 and 2019, he travelled to the United Kingdom for 3 weeks each time without the wife and/or the children.

38     The husband works – there is no denying this and the wife has been at home with the children. This was the way the parties had ordered their lives and whilst the husband cavilled and said this should not lead to a status quo argument, it remained a fact that the wife was at home with the children on a day to day basis and that she had sole day to day caregiving responsibilities after the husband left the home in end 2018.

39     Whilst the husband submitted that he was as hands on a parent as the wife, the evidence emerged that as submitted by him, he did engage a FDW. Recent examples have been cited by the wife as to the husband’s unavailability to fetch the children, culminating in an application by the husband to have his FDW fetch the children from school in his stead.

#### Access terms

40     Having considered all the factors, I left the care of the children with the wife with generous terms of access to the husband. The parties had detailed plans for sharing of contact time with the children. I dealt with most of the main areas of concern. I did not want to descend into the detailed access/contact time set out by both of them. They have a PC for this purpose and as parents, they must learn to co-parent and communicate with each other on changes in timings and days on an ad hoc basis instead of traipsing to and from Court for every disagreement.

41     The husband also raised an issue about the wife being a flight risk as she had a mountain of debts. I was of the view that he overstated his case. The wife’s debts would follow her wherever she was and in any event, if she chose to remain in the United Kingdom, the husband had every resource and legal training to compel her return. She is a citizen of the United Kingdom and she has family in the United Kingdom. To deprive her of travel home and for the children to meet their extended family who reside there was not something I was persuaded about.

42     I urge the parties to look beyond their personal resentments spawned from the marital discord and to behave in a kinder fashion one to the other for the sake of their very young children. This extends to beyond arrangements of contact time. The parties have to learn to communicate with each other on issues pertaining to the children’s residency status and schooling needs. Simply put, I ask the parties to behave for the sake of the children instead of sending hurtful text messages and accusatory inflammatory emails which unfortunately, I had to plough through. They are after all, these children’s immediate role models and their conduct and behaviour will leave a lasting impact on these impressionable young minds.

## Maintenance for the wife and the children

### The wife’s position

#### Background

43     The wife said that prior to the breakdown of the marriage in June 2018 or thereabouts, the family’s monthly expenses was in the region of $35,000 to $40,000 monthly. She said that the husband unilaterally reduced her access to finds to $2,500 monthly from September 2018 and she did not have adequate finances to manage the home as well as the children’s expenses. She was forced to take loans from friends, used funds from the parties’ company (xxx Pte Ltd) and she also pawned her engagement ring. She did not agree to the deduction by the husband and the forced lifestyle changes which she said also impacted the children.

#### His income

44     She said that the husband was in a position to pay the amounts that he used to pay because of his income. She assessed his income to be GBP7,098 monthly in 2018 and GBP9,238 monthly in 2019. She also reviewed his billings for 2018 and assessed this to be GBP72,973 and GBP76,955 for 2019. She submitted that his income had improved steadily and that this was also the husband’s position when parties litigated the issue of relocation. She asked the Court to take into account the husband’s regular arbitral appointments, his reference to additional billing amounting to USD169,820 and $25,000 in 2019 and his confidence that his practice was in a good place when he submitted on this issue for the relocation application.

45     She submitted that his 2019 income was therefore GBP9,238 or $16,536. Additionally, as the husband arranged a monthly pay out of $7,500 from the Friends Provident International policy, he has a disposable income of $16,536 plus $7,500 totalling $24,036 per month.

#### Her income

46     As for her income and employment prospects, she said that she has not worked for the last 5 years. Her last drawn income was about $6,000 in June 2014. She was not optimistic that she would be able to secure a job in the foreseeable future. She also took the view that she needed to be home for the children because of the many changes in their lives – change in their extra-curricular activities, residence, family make up, loss of their relationship with the FDW they shared a home with etc. She raised concerns about the negative impact on their young lives if she was to be away from them for extended periods during the transitional period.

#### Her claim

47     She submitted that the husband was in a position to maintain the children and her in the lifestyle they were accustomed to: the parties lived in a private residence with a porch and play area for the children, that she had the use of a car, that she had the services of a FDW, that the family used to travel and that she did not have to worry about finances because the husband was supporting the family’s expenses of $35,000 - $40,000 monthly. She said that the husband continued to maintain a lavish lifestyle as evidenced by his credit card bills and this was at the expense of the children and her.

48     She set out a chart of the expenses and she thus claimed monthly maintenance in the following sums: $10,961 for rental and household, $3,437.08 for herself, $2,902.08 for their daughter and $2,419.08 for their son. Her total claim amounted to $19,720 monthly which she submitted that the husband could afford from his income and other financial resources. The husband submitted that he was willing to pay to the wife lump sum maintenance and in reply, the wife said that she would consider this save that she wanted a lump sum of $243,000 whilst the husband proposed a lump sum of $75,000.

### The husband’s position

49     As the husband sought an order for the children to live with him, his position was that he would maintain them. To be precise, he proposed that he would pay the children’s general expenses and their specific expenses while they are with him, and/or the wife to look after their specific expenses while the children are with her (e.g. accommodation, food, and so on). This was to be for a period of 12 months and he would then assess the amount of maintenance to be paid by the wife for the children in light of her income (which she started working).

#### His income

50     The husband said that his income for the last three years averaged $10,058 per month. In addition, he has access to a further $7,500 per month as set out in paragraph 44 above. His income was assessed to be about $17,558 rounded off to $18,000 per month ($10,058 plus $7,500). His income figure was derived from the figures in his IRAS NOAs for the last three years. He disagreed with the wife’s method of calculating his income over a three-month period as opposed to a three-year average and submitted that her conclusions were skewed.

#### Her income

51     As for the wife, he said that the wife should return to the workforce. He was of the view that she would likely be able to find a position and achieve an income of $6,000 to $9,000 per month exclusive of bonuses and benefits (such as health insurance).

#### His reply to her claims

52     The husband assessed his current expenditure for himself, including for the operation of his current apartment, to be $8,500 per month and expenses for the daughter to be $1,890 per month and $1,650 for their son on the basis of the current caregiving and access timings. However, if he was awarded care and control, he said that expenses in respect of the children would increase, specifically the sums paid in respect of food and other consumables, outings, and possibly clothing and he estimated the increase to be up to $1,000 per month per child or a further $3,000 per month to allow for contingencies. He would be and has since employed a FDW and this increased his monthly expenses by a further $1,000 per month. He said that he would be able to sustain these expenses totalling $16,000 per month with his income as set out.

53     He submitted that the wife’s allegations about his expenses could not be sustained as she had looked at his statements for expenses when he left the matrimonial home to set up a separate residence. He also criticized her expenses lists eg holiday and entertainment expenses and expenses for a fitness programme.

54     After considering the matters raised, he said he would not be able to sustain the wife’s claims as set out, namely: household and rental of $10,961, $3,437.08 for herself, $2,902.08 for the daughter and $2,491.08 for their son. He was not able to support the total sum of $19,791.24 (wife’s claim) as well as his expenses of $16,000 per month on his monthly income of $18,000.

55     Accordingly, he proposed to support the children as set out in paragraph 50 and he offered the wife a lump sum of $75,000. If he was not awarded care and control of the children, he proposed a monthly maintenance sum of $4,000 for the children and in addition, pay directly the nursery fees for the two children. As for the wife, he proposed a lump sum maintenance amount of $75,000.

## Court’s decision on the issue of maintenance

56     Firstly, I accepted the husband’s submission on his income and this was thus assessed to be $18,000 per month. The reliance on IRAS was the appropriate method for assessment as apposed the wife’s extrapolation of his income. Secondly, I considered the children’s necessary expenses in terms of their residence and schooling needs and then I considered their day to day expenses. The big ticket items were that of rental and their nursery fees. It was not possible for the wife to make these payments or to contribute in a meaningful way at this point in time and hence I structured an order in which the husband would contribute to the rental of a residence for the wife and the children for a period of two years until such time as the wife was able to obtain gainful employment. The husband should continue to pay for the children’s nursery fees as this was within his financial resources.

57     As for the wife, maintenance was capped to a fixed amount for a fixed period bearing in mind that the husband would be contributing to a roof over her head as well as her living expenses until such time as it was economically feasible for her to maintain her own expenses. I have no doubt that she would be able to find work – she has a law degree and holds a Masters of Law. She managed to work as a paralegal for a monthly salary of some $6,000 which was more than modest.

58     I then looked at the wife’s list of expenses (see pages 63 to 66 of her written submissions) and my view of the expenses as set out below, led to the orders that I then made:

59     In view of the findings I had made on reasonable expenses of the children, the order was thus for the husband to pay a monthly sum of $1,500 as maintenance for each child totalling $3,000 per month.

60     The award was thus $2,000 monthly for the wife (for a period of 24 months) and $3,000 monthly for the children at $1,500 per month per child. Additionally, the husband was to contribute a monthly sum of $4,500 as rental for the wife and the children for 2 years and after the expiry of that lease, maintenance for the children would increase to $2,500 per month per child to take into account their accommodation needs. Maintenance for the wife would have ceased completely by then. Hence, at its highest level, the husband would be contributing $4,500 (rental) + $2,000 (wife) + $3,000 (children) + $1,500 (school fees for the children) = $11,000 per month for a period of 2 years. He would have $7,000 monthly to manage his personal expenses from his income of $18,000.

61     When the wife’s maintenance ceased in October 2021 together with the cessation of the tenancy agreement, he would be paying $5,000 (children) and $1,500 (school fees for the children) = $6,500 per month. The additional sum for the children was to take into account their accommodation needs and I had pegged this at a modest increase of $1,000 per month per child. This sum of $6,500 is about 36% of his income of $18,000 and the husband should be able to comfortably afford this.

## Division of matrimonial assets

62     The parties raised many issues with many items when it came to the division of the matrimonial assets. From the outset, I would say that I found largely in the husband’s favour. The wife did not appeal the orders that I made and as such, my reasons hereinafter would only relate to the division insofar as the order was not in accordance with what the husband wanted.

#### Assets that were excluded

63     The following assets were excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets and thus not amenable for division:

> Lowry sketch

> David Boyd print

> John Coburn prints - 2

> John Maitland painting

> Block sculpture

> Fabian Perez painting

> John Olsen print

> Battams painting

> BMW650 (Car)

> Property at xxx (the London property)

64     Insofar as these items were excluded from the pool, I agreed with the husband as set out in his written submissions at pages 16 to 31 and summarized in his chart at pages 15 and 16. I do not believe that the husband would be challenging this in his appeal as the orders are in his favour.

65     The wife also agreed to exclude the following in the husband’s sole name:

> BHP shares

> South 32 shares

> Fidelity Unit Trust

> Bankers Trust Investment

> Jewellery and luxury items

> _xxx Pte Ltd – consent order_

66     The husband and the wife were directors and shareholders of this chocolate company. The wife said that she ran the company whilst the husband said he also contributed monetarily if not in terms of other efforts. In any event, at the hearing, the wife had made an offer to the husband for the settlement of this issue which the husband accepted. The parties agreed that the husband would relinquish his entitlement to the company upon the wife paying to him a sum of $8,438 and as the wife did not have the funds, this was to be set off against the amount to be paid to the wife in the final division. The husband said this should be paid in any event but he did not pursue this aspect with alacrity. The wife also required the husband to sign the audited accounts for the periods in which he remained as a director and shareholder and she offered an indemnity to the husband as to any losses that would have been occasioned by his previous appointment.

67     This order was made by consent and reflected in page 12 at paragraph D, page 30 at paragraph E, page 55 at paragraph E and page 74 at paragraph E of the Notes of Evidence. The husband also referred to this at paragraph 31 of his written submissions and he consented to the payment of the sum of $8,438.

#### The orders on division and other issues

68     I now deal with the other orders that I had made with regard to the division.

#### No division of wedding gifts, household items, furniture

69     The parties presented lists of the respective items they sort division. The lists from the husband included items such as: gongs and stands, drums, wine bottles and box, shoe chest and bookshelf, wedding gifts, food photographs, 2 red Cellini chairs, jewellery items and furniture. The lists from the wife included items such as: maps, chest of drawers, sideboards, standing lamps, sofa, outdoor furniture, towels, crystal whiskey decanter, salad bowl, truffle slicer, van gogh dining table and 4 chairs, cake stand, serving plates, iron cart etc.

70     Both parties did not have the market values of the items. The wife proposed to use the purchase prices which the husband objected to as he said these values would be outdated. The husband himself put some values on his items or items he was seeking from the wife’s possession but these were also arbitrary values or based on original purchase prices. Both parties did not want to conduct formal valuation of these items as some of the items were as old as their marriage, about 6 to 7 years old.

71     The wife submitted that the items the husband had taken (including those I had ruled as items that should be excluded from the pool), be included into the pool of matrimonial assets and that there should be equal division thereof. According to her, this meant that the husband had to pay her a sum of $1,439,823.87. She also sought to retain specific items as set out in paragraph 138 of her written submissions, which she valued to be in the region of $42,324. These items included: shoe chest, drums, Ghana paintings, chest of drawers, framed baby pictures, 2 red Cellini chairs, rug, bed, outdoor lounge set, television, serving plates and champagne glasses. At the hearing, she submitted that the items removed and retained by the husband amounted to $101,419 and the items in her possession amounted to $61,995.

72     The husband naturally objected to the arbitrary values cited by the wife. In his submissions, with regard to the Singapore furniture, he said that parties should keep what they have with no value being added to the pool (see paragraph 37 of PWS). He adopted the same position with regard the wedding gifts at paragraphs 39 to 41 of his written submissions. I had agreed with the husband on the specific items to be excluded as they were pre-marital assets (see paragraph 63 above). Hence, the husband’s appeal centred on items that were in the wife’s possession and for which he sought an order of transfer to him: 2 red Cellini chairs, framed map, bookshelf (which both parties referred to as ‘antique’), food photographs, Ghana painting, 2 bronze sculptures and a Yunurupa painting.

73     After reviewing the matter, I declined to delve into the division of the items sought. Both parties did not have proper valuation of the items and were not keen to expend costs to have the disputed items valued. The purchase prices of the items could not be relied on as the price at purchase would not be the current market value of the item. In the absence of uncontroverted evidence on their values, I found that most of the items were _de minimis_ in terms of value – examples included the truffle slicer, cutlery, gong and stands, rug, standing lamps, shoe chest, bookshelf, maps, sofa, serving sets and the like etc.

74     As for the larger items for which the parties tried to ascribe a value eg the red Cellini chairs, they both could not agree on the value and they declined to pursue formal valuations thereof. The Court should not be asked to decide on issues such as which item is to be retained by which party without the values being furnished and without a full recounting as to why one party should be preferred over the other.

75     After reviewing their arguments and considering the case holistically, both parties have a reasonable selection of the items they had accumulated throughout the marriage. The parties should move on and begin again instead of fighting about a truffle slicer or a bookshelf. I therefore refused to divide these items.

#### Liabilities that were not included

76     The husband listed as his liabilities his debts to his parents. He said that he took loans amounting to $440,570 from his father from mid-2018 and he entered into a ‘master agreement which stipulates commercial terms’. He owed his mother a sum of GBP200,000 from 2005 which he took to assist him with the London property. He also referred to a sum of GBP210,000 which he said he drew down on his pre-marital savings and this was parked with the London property.

77     As I had made a finding that the London property was not a matrimonial asset amenable for division, I disregarded the liabilities attached to the property. This would be sum of GBP200,000 owing to his mother and the sum of GBP210,000 from his pre-marital savings and parked with the London property.

78     I now turn to the loan with his father. I disregarded this as well. The timing and existence of the loan document led to an inference that this was prepared for purposes of the divorce proceedings and to defeat the wife’s claim with regard to division. The husband himself said that he did in fact formally recorded the loans as the wife had threatened divorce proceedings. He said that this did not detract from the validity of the loan.

79     The point to be made here was nothing to do with his family’s wealth or the validity of the loan. The issue was whether the loan should be considered as liabilities to be deducted from the matrimonial pool. I declined to do so as the loan was a loan extended by a father to a son and the commercial terms were added only when divorce proceedings were imminent. It appeared that the loans were extended on an ad hoc basis and indeed the loan agreement the husband referred to stated that additional sums could be loaned.

80     There was no clear definition of the usage of the monies and no accounting recorded by the husband as to how the monies were applied exactly for the family’s expenses. In his father’s affidavit, the father also referred to the loans to assist the husband in his legal expenses and his family expenses. Without a breakdown of the usage of the monies, it would not be correct to attribute the amount into the pool as some of the monies could have been used for the London property (excluded from the pool) or legal fees (discussed below) and these should not be allowed to prejudice the wife’s claim.

81     In the same manner, I disallowed the inclusion of the loans taken by the wife from friends to fund her legal fees or living expenses. There was simply no demarcation as to what amount was used for what purposes. Further, there was no argument tendered by the parties as to whether the wife could have lived within what had been provided by the husband save for the husband’s general averment of the wife’s extravagance. There being no clear evidence as to the usage of the loans or usage that this Court could have accepted as legitimate expenses, I thus disregarded the wife’s loans as well.

#### Legal fees

82     Both parties expended hefty legal fees in the course of the proceedings. The proceedings included contested divorce proceedings (subsequently resolved with mediation), personal protection applications, relocation application, interim applications for access etc. The legal fees for both parties were significant and at last count estimated to be in the region of $300,000 for the wife and $150,000 for the husband.

83     I was not minded to include these fees as liabilities to be deducted from the pool of matrimonial assets. In _AQT v AQU_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGHC 138</span>, the Court held that it was ‘highly unusual’ for legal fees to be deducted from the pool of matrimonial assets as it would set an ‘unwise precedent’. These should be borne by the parties respectively. To deduct the legal fees from the joint pool would increase litigation and dis-incentivize any form of settlement for contentious proceedings. This is not something that should be encouraged especially for matrimonial matters.

#### Friend’s Provident Pension

84     The husband set up this pension scheme in 2007, before the marriage. He paid fixed sums into this pension until November 2017 when it was no longer possible to do so. He accepted that the sums paid post-marriage and the accumulation of the amount in the pension constituted matrimonial assets amenable for division and divided the amounts pre and post marriage. The wife wanted the whole amount to be considered by the Court.

85     The wife’s position was untenable as pre-marital assets could not form part of the pool of matrimonial assets to be divided – the law is clear on this (see Section 112 Subsection 10 of the Women’s Charter Cap 353). Accordingly, I adopted the husband’s position as set out in paragraphs 33 to 35 of his written submissions and included a sum of $161,877.11 into the pool.

#### Agreed matrimonial assets and liabilities and division

86     Having dealt with the assets to be excluded and/or included into the pool, I now set out the divisible assets and agreed liabilities to be deducted and my decision on the payment of $120,000 to the wife.

#### Date of division

87     The husband agreed with the prevailing legal principles that the operative date for identification of the agreed matrimonial assets was the date of Interim Judgment and for the valuation to be the date of the hearing. Given the evidence from the parties, I adopted a value that was available that was closest in time to the hearing of the ancillary matters.

88     The wife’s position was different as she sought to input values of assets at different timeframes as she said that the husband had interfered with the balances. I did not agree with this and I did not see any sort of interference from the husband as to the balances in the accounts. He continued per normal with regard deposits and expenses and there were no unusual withdrawals or alarming transactions that would have compelled the Court to adopt the wife’s position. As such, the values would be at dates as close to the hearing of the ancillary matters as possible.

89     The agreed matrimonial assets and values as well as liabilities to be deducted were as follows:

90     It was not disputed that the wife worked during the marriage; as a paralegal and then as a chocolatier. The husband also worked and accordingly, I adopted the approach as set out in _ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span>. The Court of Appeal in _ANJ v ANK_ set out a structured approach (at \[17\]–\[30\]) to determine a just and equitable division of matrimonial assets. This approach may be summarised as follows (see _ANJ v ANK_ at \[22\]–\[26\], \[28\]; _Twiss, Christopher James Hans v Twiss, Yvonne Prendergast_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGCA 52</span> (“_Twiss_”) at \[17\]):

> (a)     express as a ratio the parties’ direct contributions relative to each other, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets;

> (b)     express as a second ratio the parties’ indirect contributions relative to each other, having regard to both financial and non-financial contributions; and

> (c)     derive the parties’ overall contributions relative to each other by taking an average of the two ratios above (the derived ratio shall hereinafter be referred to as the “average ratio”), keeping in mind that, depending on the circumstances of each case, the direct and indirect contributions may not be accorded equal weight, and one of the two ratios may be accorded more significance than the other. Adjustments may also be made taking into consideration other relevant factors under Section 112 or 114(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“WC”).

91     Applying the approach to the facts of this case, the ratios are as follows:

#### Indirect contributions

92     I ascribed an equal percentage as indirect contributions and that I did not adjust the weightage. This was a marriage in which both parties played their respective roles and indeed this was resonant of what was affirmed by the Court of Appeal as “the philosophy of marriage being an equal partnership” (_TNL v TNK_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 15</span> at \[44\]).

93     This required that contributions to the marriage, be they direct financial contributions in the form of acquiring matrimonial assets or providing for the family, or indirect contributions in the form of homemaking, are to be accorded equal recognition. The purpose of the structured approach laid down in _ANJ v ANK_ – requiring a Court to identify the ratio of each spouse’s direct and indirect contributions – was to ensure that indirect contributions were placed on an equal footing as direct contributions.

94     This was an important point as the Court is reminded to bear in mind the underlying philosophy of marriage as an equal cooperative partnership of different efforts and to look at all relevant circumstances to reach a just, fair and equitable division of the matrimonial assets.

95     Having looked at the circumstances of this particular case, I was of the view that the wife did play her part in the marriage in the realm of homemaking and caregiving of both the husband and the children. She also gave up her life in the United Kingdom to be with the husband in Singapore and to assist the husband on the homefront so that he could build up his career in Asia. Whilst the husband did cast disparaging remarks about the wife’s efforts, there could not be any doubt that she had to look after two very young children, away from her home and her family members. She also started the chocolate business and maintains it currently. Both parties played their respective parts in the roles they had adopted.

96     Given the facts of the case and the length of the marriage and considering the size of the divisible assets, a percentage of 25% of the joint net assets of $462,010.02 was modestly fair and translated to $115,502.51. The wife’s assets were a meagre $2,069.79 and I was not minded to reduce the award by that amount. The husband retains a considerable asset pool which were not divisible and as such, I was of the view that the justice of the case and the facts and circumstances were such that it was fair and equitable to award the wife a sum of $120,000.

## Costs of the proceedings

97     The parties have been locked in litigation for about 2 years and I note that there are also ongoing proceedings in the United Kingdom. Given the amounts that they had already expended on legal costs, the size of the divisible assets and the level of acrimony between them, I did not want to exacerbate matters further with an award of costs. In any event, neither party could have been said to have succeeded in their claims: the husband said that there was nothing to divide and pursued a submission in which the wife was to receive nothing after 7 years of marriage and two children. The wife’s claims were conversely ambitious and she did not succeed in many of her claims as well.

98     This was a case in which both parties should bear their own costs. In any event, the parties represented themselves and there would not be legal costs awarded to either as a result.

99     The husband also ran an argument about the costs that should be attributed to the wife’s former lawyers as they were ‘shadow-boxing’ or representing the wife in the background. He also made remarks about the way they had been advising the wife. The wife conceded that they assisted her but that the final drafts were hers.

100    I explained at the hearing that it was the wife’s choice to have lawyers assist her in the background and the Court only dealt with the matters and the parties before it. If indeed the husband had an issue with the wife’s former lawyers, this was not the forum to pursue it. I accordingly disregarded his submissions on this issue and as stated, made no orders as to costs of these proceedings.
