Family Law – Variation – Consent order

5 March 2019

### District Judge Kathryn Thong:

## Introduction

1       The proceedings before me concerned cross-variation applications launched by the mother and father in relation to a consent ancillary matters order dated 14 February 2017.

2       The said consent order had provided that the mother was to have care and control of parties’ two sons, aged 8 and 5 years old respectively at the material time, and the father was to have reasonable access.

3       As regards the matrimonial assets, parties were to retain the matrimonial flat – an HDB executive flat – as joint owners under HDB’s ‘Joint Single Scheme’, and would not claim against each other in respect of any other assets. The expectation was that both parties would continue to reside together, despite being divorced.

4       Maintenance-wise, under the consent order, the father was to pay $400 as total monthly maintenance for the two sons, and there would be no spousal maintenance for the mother.

5       However, just two months later in April 2017, the mother moved out of the matrimonial home, leaving both sons with their father. In yet another twist, in November 2017, the father’s new wife moved in with – incidentally also two boys – sired by him.

6       On 20 March 2018, the father launched an application for variation of the consent order, such that he would have sole care and control of the children, and the mother to have alternate weekend access. Correspondingly, he would be “solely responsible” for the “monthly maintenance and financial upkeep” of both children.

7       He also prayed for the mother to transfer to him her rights, title and interest in the matrimonial flat with the requisite CPF refunds and accrued interest to be made into her CPF account.

8       In turn, on 24 April 2018, the mother filed a variation application for the matrimonial home to be sold in the open market within 6 months and for the net sale proceeds to be divided equally between parties. She also prayed for the father to have the first option to purchase her share in the matrimonial flat based on its market value.

9       In addition, the mother’s summons sought the immediate return of the children to her care and control, as well as for their birth certificates, passports and school essentials to be returned forthwith.

10     Eventually I ordered that the father was to have care and control of their two sons, and the mother was to have reasonable access to them. In my view, preserving the status quo was vital to the welfare of the children who by the time of the hearing, were in Primary 5 and Primary 1. I found that the father was attuned to the children’s needs and they were developing well under him.

11     Further, the mother had not presented alternatives to the current situation which would best promote the children’s welfare. For instance, her place of residence at the time of hearing was temporary and further away from the children’s school. She also intended for the children to be placed in a day care centre after school, but I saw no benefits to that over the current situation where they could return to the matrimonial home and rest.

12     As regards the matrimonial flat, I did not see any basis for it to be sold. The children had been staying there all their lives since birth, and it was within walking distance to their school. The continued provision of a roof over their heads was necessary for the children to feel secure. I saw no need to sell the family home and to uproot them.

13     With the father’s second wife residing at the flat there was no reason for the mother to continue being a joint owner of the flat. I ordered that the mother transfer her rights, title and interest to the father. Applying _ANJ v ANK_, I found that the mother was entitled to 37.5% of the market valuation of the matrimonial home.

14     The mother has appealed against my decision to award care and control to the father. My grounds thus focus solely on this issue.

## Background

15     Parties married on 14 February 2001. At this time of writing, the older boy, Marvin, would have commenced Primary 5 and his younger brother, Adrian, Primary 2. Both are studying in the same primary school within shot walking distance from the matrimonial flat. They presently reside with their father, their stepmother, their half-siblings (two boys aged 5 and 4 years old), and a domestic helper.

16     The mother and father are 45 and 46 years old respectively. The father is a warrant officer in the army earning a gross income of some $9,000 whilst the mother appears to work in the hotel industry. It is unclear how much she earns due to the paucity of evidence.

17     The marriage broke down sometime in 2012 and a Deed of Separation (“the Deed”) was entered into by parties on 1 November 2013.

18     The Deed provided _inter alia_, that parties had been leading separate lives since 1 January 2013 though they were residing under the same roof, and that during the period of separation, the father would bear certain monthly household expenses, and would maintain the children at $1,000 a month. Upon dissolution of the marriage, the mother shall have care and control of both children.

19     Sometime in 2016, the father applied to the Housing Development Board (“HDB”) for the parties to retain, post-divorce, the matrimonial home, under a ‘Joint Singles’ Scheme. This would allow parties to continue residing together after the divorce.

20     The mother claimed that this proposal was mooted by the father, and she had agreed as she bought into the father’s plan to ensure continuity and stability for Marvin and Adrian. Subsequent events however, convinced her that he had cynical reasons for this proposal.

21     On 9 December 2016, the HDB approved parties’ application to retain the flat under the ‘Joint Singles’ scheme, subject to the same being recorded expressly in the ancillary matters order.

22     The father commenced divorce proceedings on 9 January 2017. On 14 February 2017, interim judgment was granted and the consent order recorded. The relevant clauses are summarised at \[2\] - \[4\] above.

23     Parties continued residing together after 14 February 2017. Then, on 28 April 2017, the mother left the matrimonial home without the children. She protested the father’s accusation that in so doing she had abandoned their sons; she explained she had left due to the father’s abuse and harassment, and that he had threatened to assault her if she left with their two sons. However other than her claim that the father would “hit or bang against furniture” there were no particulars given of such alleged abuse or harassment.

24     The father denied inflicting any abuse on her and pointed out that if he had done so, the mother would have taken action against him.

25     At the time of hearing, the mother was living with her auntie in a flat in the north-east region of Singapore, though she added she was looking for a place closer to the children’s school. And while she no longer lived at the matrimonial home, it was undisputed that occasionally when the father was overseas in Vietnam, she would return to care for Marvin and Adrian. The mother would also have access to the children. The frequency of such access post-departure from the matrimonial home was however unclear.

26     In November 2017, the father solemnised his marriage with his current wife and that same month, his new wife moved into the matrimonial home with her two sons, sired by the father. At the time of writing, the half-siblings are 5 and 4 years old, born in 2014 and 2015 respectively.

## The present applications

27     On 20 March 2018, the father applied to vary the consent order and the mother filed a cross-variation application on 24 April 2018 (see \[6\] – \[9\] above). A particularly sticking point for her was the father bringing the children overseas on three occasions in April and May 2018, without her consent, and to rub salt into the wound, also disallowing her to bring Marvin and Adrian to Malaysia, as he believed it would be dangerous for a lone woman to bring them there.

28     In what can only be regarded as a retaliatory act, the mother also later refused permission to the father to bring their sons to Vietnam for a holiday. (The father’s new wife is Vietnamese).

29     On 14 June 2018, an interim consent order was entered into where the mother would have alternate weekend access overnight access with the children, and alternate Wednesday night dinner with Marvin and Adrian.

30     Even then, there continued to be disputes over the access arrangements. The father stated that he had always been responsible for arranging tuition for Marvin and Adrian, supervising and coaching them in their studies. After her weekend access, the father claimed the mother would refuse to return the children to him on Sunday nights so that he could revise their homework with him. Instead, the mother would insist on sending the children to school on Monday mornings. Yet, she would be late, causing the children unnecessary stress and embarrassment. In response, the mother expressed her unhappiness with the father holding on to the birth certificates, passports, clothing and school essentials of the children after the Deed was entered into.

31     In their respective affidavits, cross-allegations were made of neglectful parenting and questionable morals. For instance, the mother claimed that the father never spent time with the children and was too busy with – in her own words (and throughout counsel’s submissions) – “the Vietnamese” and their two sons, thereby neglecting Marvin and Adrian. She alleged he had committed bigamy by marrying his wife in Vietnam, whilst still married to her, something vehemently denied by the father. He had also been adulterous to which the father’s rejoinder was that his relationship with his current wife only began after the marriage had broken down.

32     On his part, the father claimed that the mother had a close male friend who was aggressive and whom the mother was cohabiting with. He claimed that the mother refused to share details of this close male friend. Yet, this male friend was treated like a “family member” by Marvin and Adrian. In the father’s view, the mother was not setting a proper role model for the children. Of course there was some irony to this since the father himself conceded that his younger sons with his current wife were born out of wedlock.

33     It was undisputed that the close male friend of the mother was involved in an accident with the children, and whilst the mother dismissed their injuries as minor, and due to the fault of another motorist, the father took issue with the mother informing him belatedly of the injuries; the mother claimed the father was making a mountain out of a molehill and he was not at all concerned when she first informed him of the injuries.

34     As for parties’ proposed care arrangements, the mother suggested that the children remain in their primary school for the sake of stability, but after school, they would proceed to a day care centre instead of returning to the matrimonial home as is presently the case. She claimed Marvin and Adrian had attended a trial session at a day care centre and enjoyed it.

35     Refuting her allegations, the father stated that the children had on many occasions objected to the idea of day care, as they were comfortable in their own home, and had in fact conveyed their unwillingness to attend day care to their mother. According to the father, the children disliked day care as they could not shower, eat or rest as they wished, and they would be directed to do their school work without any proper teaching or coaching.

36     The father argued that the children should continue with their present routine of returning home after school for home cooked meals, where they could shower and rest, and would be supervised by their step-mother in terms of doing their homework, and also by their paternal grandparents. Further, should there be any medical emergencies, the father’s domestic helper and his wife, were well-prepared for those.

37     In response, the mother stated that the grandparents do not share a strong bond with the children, nor did they supervise the children’s homework. Instead, it would be better for her to take care of the children personally when her work ends.

## Counsel’s submissions

38     Counsel for the father, Mr Harold Seet, submitted that the Deed had envisaged that parties would continue residing in the matrimonial flat and this indeed, was the case, until April 2017 when the mother left the house. The mother having eventual care and control of the children upon the dissolution of the marriage, was subject to her residing in the matrimonial flat.

39     By her unilaterally moving out of the flat, Mr Seet submitted that this had led to a material change in circumstances and the order had to be varied accordingly under section 128 of the Women’s Charter. In the alternative, it would be reasonable and in the welfare of the children for the consent order to be varied under section 129 of the Women’s Charter.

40     He also submitted that the flat ought to be retained instead of being sold, so that the children’s lives would not be disrupted. Stability and continuity was crucial for them.

41     Mr Seet pointed out that the children’s primary school was within short walking distance from the school and after school, the children could return home to rest. Marvin and Adrian, he submitted, had adjusted well to their new family and enjoyed the company of their new siblings. Their bond with the father was strong and they had always been under the coaching and guidance of their father in respect of their studies, and this was borne out by the fact that Marvin had achieved better grades in his Mandarin when he had failed the subject in 2017, and also obtained a Good Progress Award for Conduct.

42     On the other hand, the mother was associated with a man with an aggressive disposition. Also, she had resided with a niece who was remanded at a drug rehabilitation centre (“DRC”) for a period after she left the home. There were real concerns as to who the mother would be living and/or socialising with.

43     Counsel for the mother, Mr Patrick Fernandez, disagreed that there was any material change in circumstances. He submitted that mother was forced to leave the matrimonial home and was prevented by the father from taking the children with her.

44     As for the supposed precondition that the mother was to remain in the flat in order to have care and control of the children, Mr Fernandez pointed out that this was not reflected anywhere in the Deed. And whilst the Court is not bound by the Deed, the Deed, he submitted, would be a reflection of the care arrangements that are in the best interests of the children.

45     Even if there was a material change in circumstances, he submitted, it would be in the children’s best interests for the mother to retain care and control of them, as she had been their primary caregiver since birth, and would “tend to their daily needs, monitor their academic progress, organise extracurricular activities and tuition for them.” This was why parties had agreed that once the marriage was dissolved, she would have care and control of the children, as she was their primary caregiver.

46     As for the niece who was in the DRC, Mr Fernandez pointed out that the mother had since clarified that the niece was no longer living with her and in fact, the mother had since moved to Yishun which was nearer to the children’s school. However, the mother’s recent move was not on affidavit, though I note, it was also reported to the officer preparing the custody evaluation report (“CER”).

## My decision

47     At \[10\] of the High Court case of _TAU v TAT_ (“_TAU v TAT_”), the Court iterated the trite position that it is always focused on the child’s welfare:

In making orders for custody, care and control, and access, the court’s focus is on the child’s welfare, which is the paramount consideration in all proceedings directly affecting the interests of a child: see s 3 of the GIA and s 125(2) of the Charter. This welfare principle ensures that the _child’s interests are not side-lined while his or her parents litigate over what they subjectively perceive to be their respective rights and entitlements._

\[own emphasis\]

48     With “the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration”, the Court of Appeal in _Soon Peck Wah_ exhorted at \[25\] that:

...’welfare’ must be taken in its widest sense…the welfare of the child is not to be measured by money only nor by physical comfort only; the moral and religious welfare of the child must be considered as well as his physical well-being; nor can the ties of affection be disregarded. The rights and wishes of parents must be assessed and weighed in their bearing on the welfare of the child in conjunction with all other factors relative to that issue_. The question for the judge is not what the essential justice of the case requires but what the best interests of the child._

\[own emphasis\]

49     In the present case, there was no doubt that the mother had been awarded care and control under the consent order. In that light, the award of care and control of the children, was her right and entitlement. However, the Court’s focal concern is the child’s best interests – not what appears to be fair or just vis-à-vis the parties.

50     Here, I found that the children were doing well in the care of the father and there was no compelling case presented by the mother as to why the status quo should be disrupted. It had been more than a year since she had left the matrimonial home, and the father was since the primary caregiver of the children, something which the mother herself implicitly conceded, given that she stated on affidavit that she was their primary caregiver up to April 2017. Despite her departure, the children were doing fine in school and growing well living with the father.

51     For instance, the father appeared to be well attuned to the children’s academic and character development. He exhibited Marvin’s mid-year, and end of year report cards, from 2015 to 2017 which reflected his good grades and exemplary conduct in school. All report cards save for one, were signed by the father. This appeared consistent with his claim that he was the one who would keep abreast of the children’s schoolwork and general progress.

52     The father also spoke of how he had arranged Mandarin tuition for Marvin when his grades started to suffer in 2017. In response, the mother stated that she had reached out to the father to arrange for Mandarin tuition also, but he had ignored her efforts. No evidence was given however, of such efforts.

53     While the mother claimed to have monitored the children’s well-being even after she left the matrimonial home, there were no particulars given as to how she had done so. In fact, she blamed the father for failing to inform her of a meet the parent session in May 2018.

54     I found it curious that that in spite of her claims that she would monitor the children’s well-being after leaving the matrimonial home, the mother was now appearing not to take personal responsibility to be informed of matters in school. Indeed, meet the parent sessions are not extraordinary events on a school calendar. They are par for the course in most if not all schools, and Marvin being in Primary 5 at the time, she should have been familiar with the concept of such sessions. Whether the father failed to inform her, is quite beside the point. Given that the mother had moved out of the matrimonial home by then, she could have taken active steps to be updated on such matters. After all, as the mother, she has as much right to be informed of such matters as the father does.

55     She also claimed that “whenever I send the children to school, I make it a point to update their form teachers. I have exhibited a screenshot of my messages of the same…” As it turned out, this was but a single screenshot of a message sent on 7 May 2018 that the children would be late for school. No other messages or correspondence or objective evidence was exhibited.

56     Of course, given that the children were not living with the mother, it might have been more challenging to be up to date on the happenings in school than if she was residing with them. However, there was also a paucity of evidence and particulars demonstrating that whilst she was still residing at the matrimonial home, she had been actively involved in the children’s lives.

57     Her affidavits tended to fixate on the father’s new marriage, allegations of him having committed bigamy with “the Vietnamese” and how the father had humiliated her. But in terms of how she had cared for her children, she merely stated that she was their “primary caregiver from birth till April 2017”; she “made sure \[they\] ate nutritious meals, bought their clothes, monitored their academic performances, disciplined them, etc.”

58     Even in stating what her indirect, non-financial contributions towards the marriage were in relation to caring of the children, she simply repeated the refrain that she was their primary caregiver, was “responsible for their care and upbringing” and had paid for some of the children’s expenses, when she was working from 2001-2012.

59     In contrast, the father was able to give particulars of how he cared for the children, such as accompanying them to all school activities including parent-teacher meetings; seeing to all their medical needs or check-ups; inculcating values and virtues such as thriftiness and forbearance; disciplining them by correcting them when they are in the wrong and explaining to them thereafter where they had gone wrong. Notably, the mother did not dispute these matters in her affidavit despite having the opportunity to do so.

60     I hasten to point out that the purpose of this comparison is not to suggest that the father was the “better” parent and this is certainly not the threshold to be met – but rather, that the father appears to have been, and continues to be so, familiar with the needs of the children and attends to them. In contrast, the mother does not appear to be that engaged or involved in their lives, particularly in the area of school/academic life, which for any primary school student in Singapore, takes up about half of one’s daily waking hours.

61     That the Deed and consent order provided for the mother to have care and control of the children, may suggest to be an acknowledgement that she was the primary caregiver of the child and/or it is in the best interests of the children to be in her care and control. However, I find that it was envisaged that parties would remain residing together after the divorce – this as much is clear from the consent order recorded on 14 February 2017, and from the mother’s evidence. Given that this was to be the living arrangements post-divorce, I do not think anything should be read into the clause that she would have care and control of the children.

62     Even if it was the mother who was the primary caregiver of the children whilst she was still living at the matrimonial home, this was historical. As the mother appeared to have conceded, vis-à-vis parties, the father was now the primary caregiver after she left the matrimonial home. The question of what is in the child’s best interests is a forward looking inquiry, and prospective in nature. I do not find that being a past caregiver, is a factor that is necessarily sufficient on its own to satisfy the threshold of the child’s best interest. It is not the end of the argument, for one to contend that simply because he/she is the erstwhile primary caregiver, naturally, it would mean that it is in the child’s best interests for care and control to be accordingly awarded to him/her going forward. There is simply no presumption this way; the Court looks at what is the welfare and best interests of the child and not labels.

63     At the time of the hearing, the mother was living in a flat in the north-east region with her auntie. The children were however, living in the north region and their school was within walking distance. As mentioned earlier, in her affidavit, the mother claimed to be searching for a place near to the children’s school. It was only in Mr Fernandez’s written submissions and the CER, that it was reported by the mother that she had since moved to a rental flat in Yishun. This has not been verified.

64     Without a place of residence which location would be convenient for the children to travel to and from school, I saw no sense in uprooting the children from their stable home environment. This remained my view even if she had indeed since moved into a rental flat at Yishun. There was no evidence as to how she intended to send the children to and from school, and she clearly did not have a permanent place of residence, which did not augur particularly well for the children’s future, as she might find herself moving from one rental flat to another. Indeed, there was no indication as to the duration of the tenancy of the Yishun flat. Regardless of whether there was justification for her leaving the matrimonial home, the unshakeable fact was that the children are presently safe, secure and stable in the matrimonial home and the alternative accommodation proposed by the mother is in a nebulous state.

65     Further, the mother’s proposal to place the children at a day care centre, was not in their welfare, when they had a comfortable home environment to return to. The father had explained on affidavit, the children were accustomed to returning from school to their home where they could have home-cooked meals, shower, rest and do their homework in the comfort of their home, and did not like being in day care.

66     In my view, unless otherwise proven, the home environment certainly has more benefits than being in a day care centre. It is better to return to family than to strangers. Even if the mother’s claim that the children did not have a “strong bond” with the grandparents was true, the familiar home environment is still a better place to return to, than that of a random day care centre. And whilst the mother alleged that there was overcrowding in the matrimonial home, there was no such complaint from the children or such concern raised in the confidential CER. This allegation I note, was based on the mother’s erroneous belief that the grandparents lived at the matrimonial home, but it appears that the grandparents drop in occasionally and in fact, the mother accepted that during the marriage, they would come around to help.

67     In fact, the mother appeared misguided as to the purpose of day care. In her own words, the proposed placement was “to ensure my children receive proper care and assistance in their weak subjects…I will fetch the children from the student care after my work and take care of them at night. During school holidays, I will enrol the children in the student care centre’s holiday programme.” This reliance on day care centre to assist the children in their weaker subjects was curious, as that is not generally the role of a day care centre, and there was no evidence as to which day care centre she had in mind, and/or whether even if she had identified a specific day care centre, it would fulfil the above objectives. In the premises, I could not see how the placement in day care would be in the children’s interests.

68     It was clear to me that the status quo ought to remain because of the importance of stability and continuity in the children’s young lives. In fact, the CER revealed that Marvin had presented with some level of anxiety after litigation had commenced. There is no utility in piling additional, unnecessary stress and distress to the children with a change in care and control.

## Conclusion

69     It was apparent to me that it would be in Marvin and Adrian’s best interests to remain in the care and control of their father. The matrimonial home was a short walk to the children’s school, and they had resided there all their lives. After school, they could unwind, study, and be supervised by their step-mother and/or their grandparents. There was also a domestic helper around to help look after them. The father had always been engaged in their school life and activities, and remained so. There was no complaint raised by the children living with their father, and the CER did not hint at any such concerns. They were doing well in the care of their father; in fact, nothing much appeared to have changed since the mother left the matrimonial home, save that they saw her less.

70     Equally plain to me was the both parents loved their children and their children loved them, and that the mother should see the children more frequently. In terms of physical access, I ordered alternate weekend access and two weekdays dinner access. I add that I do not see any impediment to the mother enjoying greater access, if only parties can resolve their underlying conflict which appears to have arisen chiefly from the existence of the third parties in their lives. After all, the mother had access even after she left the home. but matters nose-dived after the current wife moved in.

71     I recognise that the mother is disappointed with my decision. I reminded counsel that with children, the circumstances are always dynamic and these orders are merely based on what the Court has found to be in the best interests of the children for now and the foreseeable future. It was not lost on me that with the father’s second family, there could be issues of favouritism in the future. But this was pure speculation - nothing in the CER hinted at that likelihood or gave rise to any concerns that the children were unhappy staying with their half-siblings and stepmother. In fact, the objective evidence showed that they were living well and even thriving, and it was in fact the ongoing litigation that adversely affected Marvin.

72     To round off, I would add that parties’ cross-allegations of immoral behaviour, verbal abuse, and other accusations, were petty and trifling and did not serve to illuminate the question of what would be in the best interests and welfare of the children.

73     Rather, effort ought to be spent by parties learning to co-parent the children and understanding their needs. Loving their children means not having Marvin and Adrian witness conflict between them, or making them feel triangulated. It may be a tall order to ask parties to forgive each other but they can and should act civilly towards each other in the children’s presence, and always, always put Marvin and Adrian’s interests first.
