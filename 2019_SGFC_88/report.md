interim maintenance for spouse – Section 69 Women’s Charter

15 August 2019

### District Judge Goh Zhuo Neng:

## A.   INTRODUCTION

1       MSS 3399 of 2018 is the Complainant Wife’s (“**Complainant**”) application against the Respondent Husband (“**Respondent**”) for interim maintenance for herself, under Section 69 of the Women’s Charter.

2       After hearing the parties, I made the following orders:

> a)     That the Respondent would pay the Complainant maintenance of $3,400.00 a month from 1 May 2019, and thereafter on the 1st day of each month into a designated account.

> b)     That the Respondent would continue to make payment of the following expenses directly to the respective vendors until the resolution of the ancillary matters in Dxxx of 2017.

>> i)       The Complainant’s current MSIG insurance policy.

>> ii)       Cost of repairs, road tax, car insurance, inspections, maintenance of the Porsche Targa (xxx) and the Bentley Flying Spur (xxx).

>> iii)       Household expenses and utilities of the matrimonial home, including the levy and salary of the 2 domestic helpers that are currently employed there.

3       On 17 May 2019, the Complainant filed her appeal against all of my orders. The full grounds of my decision are set out below.

## B.   PROCEDURAL MATTERS

4       Parties were married on xxx 2001. On 23 November 2017, the Complainant commenced divorce proceedings by filing Dxxx of 2017 and served the writ on the Respondent on 29 November 2017. On 15 February 2019, interim judgement was ordered.

5       On 14 September 2018, the Complainant filed the present application in MSS 3399 of 2018 (the “**Application**”). Parties filed and exchanged one round of affidavits in January 2019, and then proceeded to make applications for discovery. The applications for discovery were heard on 11 March 2019 and orders were made for further disclosure. At a mentions on 29 March 2019, parties took no further directions for the filing of reply affidavits, and asked for the hearing of the Application to proceed as a summons in chambers, and not as a trial. This was done, and the Application was fixed for hearing on 8 May 2019.

6       Concurrently in Dxxx of 2017, parties proceeded to exchange their Affidavits of Assets and Means (“**AOM Affidavits**”) which were filed on 2 May 2019 (Complainant) and 8 April 2019 (Respondent).

7       I was given to understand that on 6 May 2019, the Complainant’s lawyers had served on the Respondent’s lawyers, a Notice of Intention to Refer to the AOM Affidavits on the Complaint. This was 2 days before trial. This Notice was never filed, and hence it was only during the hearing on 8 May 2019 that I became aware of the Complainant’s intention to refer to the AOM Affidavits. I informed the Complainant that I would not be including the AOM Affidavits as part of the evidence in these proceedings.

8       This was done for good reason. At the final mentions for the Application on 29 March 2019, the parties chose to proceed with the hearing of the Application without seeking the right to a further reply or cross examination – even though they had already taken timelines to prepare and file their AOM Affidavits. To allow a reference to the AOM Affidavits so late in the day would allow the Complainant to surprise the Respondent at the hearing of the Application.

## B.   THE LAW

9       Under Section 69 of the Women’s Charter (Cap.353) (the “**Act**”), the Court has the power to order a spouse to make payment of interim maintenance if her husband has neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for her. The Court in doing so will take into account the factors in Section 69(4)(a).

10     In _Foo Ah Yan v Chiam Heng Chow_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 2 SLR 506</span> at \[22\], the Court of Appeal that the objective of section 69 applications is to provide “_modest maintenance_” to help the spouse “_overcome their immediate financial need_”. This is distinguishable from the objective underpinning the final maintenance applications under Section 113 of the Act, which is complementary to the power to divide matrimonial assets and to even out any financial inequalities between the spouses.

## C.   THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS

#### The Complainant’s Position

11     The Complainant sought monthly maintenance of $10,000.00, while referring to her monthly expenses of $20,540.58. These are set out in **Annex A**.

12     In support of her claims, the Complainant provided various receipts in respect of the following:

> a)     Flight and Accommodation bookings for various trips with the Respondent.

> b)     Numerous receipts at food and beverage outlets in Singapore.

> c)     Payments to a Yoga/Pilates Studio.

> d)     Grooming expenses for nails and haircuts.

> e)     Handphone expenses.

> f)     Counselling.

> g)     Credit Card expenses from May to December 2018.

#### The Respondent’s Position

13     The Respondent’s counsel explained that he was happy for an order to be recorded for him to make payment of maintenance on the terms set out in the Order that I eventually made above in paragraph 2. It was also accepted by the Complainant that the Respondent had been paying the Complainant a monthly maintenance of $3,400.00 since December 2017.

## D.   APPLICATION OF THE LAW TO THE FACTS

14     First, I assessed the reasonableness of the expenses that the Complainant was seeking on the basis that maintenance ordered at this stage should be “modest” and help to overcome her immediate financial needs.

#### Housing Expenses

15     The Complainant was seeking housing expenses for rental ($6,100.00), utilities ($250) and cable/internet ($110). In her affidavit filed in January 2019, she confirmed that she was still living in the matrimonial home, but in a separate room from the Respondent. She wished to move out as she felt she was being intimidated by the Respondent who was using his Golden Retriever to intimidate her. On this point, the Mother claimed she had filed a police report in April 2018.

16     At the hearing, I was informed by the Complainant’s counsel that she had recently moved out and was already incurring rental expenses. However, this was a relatively recent development and would not be procedurally fair to the Respondent, so I did not permit the Complainant to adduce actual evidence of the rental expenses.

17     Even if the expenses were actually being incurred by the Complainant, I could not find sufficient evidence to justify the Complainant’s need to move out. There were no specific incidents of intimidation referred to in her evidence that I could consider. Notably, proceedings for divorce had been filed in November 2017, but the Complainant continued to live with the Respondent even after the filing of the Application. In my view the decision to move out was more likely to be linked to a desire to support her claim for additional maintenance in the form of rental expenses.

18     I also noted that by remaining in the matrimonial home, the Complainant was not being forced to sleep in the same bed or room as the Respondent. She had her own separate room and contact with the Respondent would be minimalised. Also, the Respondent confirmed that he would continue to be responsible for the utilities and household expenses at the matrimonial home. Therefore, I found that the Respondent was not required to pay for her housing expenses.

#### Clothing / Bags

19     The Complainant did not provide any proof of her alleged monthly expenditure on clothing and bags of $2,313.70. Reference was made to the lavish gifts showered on the Complainant by the Respondent during the marriage. Even if this had been the case during the marriage, the parties had been married since 2001, and the Complainant would have accumulated plenty of clothing and bags during this period. An amount of $250.00 would be more than enough going forward.

#### Medical + Therapy

20     The Complainant claimed $2,744.95 in expenses for medical and therapy. There was nothing in her evidence which justified such a substantial sum being incurred. However, I did note that the Complainant incurred chiropractor visits that amounted to about $165.00 each time. So as to take into account the occasional visit to the doctor, I allocated $250.00 a month instead.

21     During the hearing, the Complainant’s counsel informed me that the Complainant had just been diagnosed with cancer. I did not permit the Complainant to tender this as evidence as this was being done on the day of the trial and it would not be procedurally fair to the Respondent.

22     Even if the Complainant had indeed been diagnosed with cancer, the question of maintenance due to her also has to be supported with the actual costs she would have to incur. As mentioned above, she did not include proof of such expenses in her documents, and moreover, I understand that the Complainant was also covered by an insurance policy that the Respondent was paying for (see below at paragraph 23). In the circumstances, it was not clear to me whether the Complainant’s expenses for the treatment of her cancer would not be covered by the insurance policy and so I decided not to order for the Respondent to make payment of maintenance for these expenses.

#### Personal Insurance

23     The Complainant claimed the monthly sum of $735.50 for medical insurance. It was not clear to me whether she was actually incurring this amount, as the supporting documents were not present in her evidence. The Respondent had indicated in his affidavit that he had recently renewed the Complainant’s MSIG Insurance policy, and that he would continue renewing it until the resolution of the ancillary matters in Dxxx of 2017. Therefore, I made the order that the Respondent would continue making payment of the Complainant’s MSIG insurance policy on those terms.

#### Vehicle Expenses

24     The Complainant claimed to be incurring various monthly expenses for her vehicle – a loan ($1,000.00), motor insurance and road tax ($700.00), and vehicle maintenance ($250.00). I did not grant maintenance for these expenses as the Complainant was not actually incurring these expenses.

25     The Complainant did not have any proof of any vehicle loan being incurred. In fact, she owned a fully paid up Bentley Silver Spur that had been given to her by the Respondent. While she preferred instead to use the Respondent’s Porsche Targa for her daily driving needs, the Respondent’s Counsel confirmed that he was happy for her to continue doing so, and that he would continue to bear the Cost of repairs, road tax, car insurance, inspections, maintenance of both vehicles.

#### Domestic Helper (Levy + Salary)

26     The Complainant was seeking the cost of hiring a domestic helper of $720.00. These expenses were tied to the Complainant moving out and staying on her own. As mentioned above, I was of the view that the Complainant had not justified the need to move out of the matrimonial home.

27     I would also add that the matrimonial home had two domestic helpers. It was not the Complainant’s case that these servants had ceased to carry out her chores, or attend to her. Moreover, the Respondent was agreeable to continue paying for the engagement of these two helpers. Therefore, I was not satisfied that the Complainant had sufficient basis to incur these expenses.

#### Yoga and Pilates

28     The Complainant was seeking expenses for Yoga and Pilates of $1,284.77 a month. I was only able to find documentary proof supporting monthly expenses of about $280.00 a month at a Pilates/Yoga studio. Therefore, I fixed those expenses at $280.00 a month.

#### Travel/ Holidays

29     The Complainant claimed she would require $1,066.66 a month for travelling and holidays. Reference here was made to the frequent trips that the couple had taken during the marriage. I accepted that while the Complainant should be entitled to travel expenses, these expenses should be reduced as we were in the interim period prior to the ancillary matters and more prudence should be exercised. I reduced the expenses to $500.00 a month.

#### Allowance for Parents

30     The Complainant required $500.00 a month to maintain her parents. I would point out that it was the Complainant’s obligation to maintain her parents. I did not allow this expense.

#### Gifts/Donation/Education

31     The Complainant claimed she would require $500.00 a month on gifts and donations, as well as $625.00 a month for education.

32     I did not feel that either of these expenses were justified. If the Complainant wished to play the generous benefactor, she could do that with her own money. Acts of generosity cannot be regarded as a living expense. As for education, I understood that the Complainant had previously been a senior manager for the South East Asian region in a Multi-National Company. There was no clear need for her to incur any educational expenses to make herself eligible for work. Neither had the Complainant provided any documentary proof of what comprised these expenses.

#### Conclusion on Expenses

33     I eventually arrived at the position that the Complainant’s reasonable monthly expenses amounted only to $2,920.00. The breakdown is set out at **Annex B**. This was considerably less than what she had asked for, and less than what the Respondent had been paying her. However, the Respondent’s Counsel confirmed that he was happy to continue making payment of $3,400.00 a month, therefore I recorded that as part of my order in addition to the expenses that parties had consented to above in relation to the cars and insurance.

## E.   CONCLUSION AND COSTS

34     In the circumstances, I made the above orders in paragraph 2. While I had ordered the Respondent to make payment of maintenance to the Complainant, these were entirely on terms that he had been willing to provide and the Complainant cannot be said to have succeeded in her application for a monthly maintenance of $10,000.00. Therefore, I ordered the Complainant to pay costs of $2,000.00 to the Respondent (including disbursements).
