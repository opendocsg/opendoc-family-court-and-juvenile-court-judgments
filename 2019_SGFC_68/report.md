Relocation; welfare of children as paramount importance, loss of relationship with left behind parent

26 June 2019

### District Judge Jen Koh:

## Introduction

1       These are my grounds for decision with regard the dismissal of the application filed by the Plaintiff wife to relocate to Kent, in the United Kingdom (‘UK’) or any such place in the UK, England as may be appropriate as well as consequential orders. The Plaintiff wife appealed the decision that I made on 26 March 2019. For ease of convenience, I refer to the Plaintiff Wife as ‘the wife’ and the Defendant Husband as ‘the husband’ and the parties are referred to collectively as ‘the parties’.

## Brief background

2       The parties were married on xx July 2011 and they have 2 children, a daughter aged about 4 and a son aged about 2 years old (‘the children’). The husband is about 47 years of age and is a Barrister/Mediator/Arbitrator. The Wife is about 37 years of age and she also is a law degree holder and has a Masters in Law. She is a director of a handmade chocolate company. The husband is the other director and the parties hold the shares equally. The parties are citizens of the UK with the husband holding dual citizenship with Australia and the wife holding dual citizenship in Ireland.

3       The parties relocated to Singapore in February 2012, some 6 months after their marriage. The parties have lived in Singapore since February 2012 save for the occasional holidays back to the UK. The parties are permanent residents of Singapore and the children are on Long Term Social Visit Passes (‘LTSVP’). This family has resided in Singapore some 7 years from February 2012 as at the date of my orders in March 2019.

4       According to the husband, cracks appeared in the marriage in 2014 and again in 2016 with issues pertaining to physical intimacy in mid-2018. He filed for divorce in July 2018.

## Litigation history

5       The wife filed divorce proceedings in the UK on 26 June 2018. The husband commenced divorce proceedings in Singapore on 9 July 2018. The wife applied to stay the divorce proceedings in Singapore but her application was dismissed on 28 January 2019. Interim judgement on the Singapore divorce proceedings has since been granted on 5 March 2019. The parties could not advise the status of the UK divorce proceedings: the husband stayed it had been stayed whilst the wife said the proceedings were pending.

6       On 9 November 2018, the wife filed an application to relocate permanently to the UK with the children. The application was dismissed on 26 March 2019.

7       In December 2018, the wife filed 2 applications for personal protection orders (‘PPO’); one for herself, the other on behalf of the children. The matters were fixed for trial before me and I dismissed both applications on 14 March 2019.

8       The husband filed an application for interim access to the children on an urgent basis on 28 December 2018. No orders were made on that application when it came on for a case conference on 8 January 2019.

9       The ancillary matters are currently at case conference stage and parties have filed their ancillary matters affidavits with one more round pending. The ancillary matters will be heard by the third quarter of 2019 barring any unforeseen circumstances.

## The wife’s case for relocation

10     The wife’s case in summary is as follows:

(a)     That the husband is unable to afford the family’s costs of living in Singapore. She said that the husband has divested and expended a significant portion of the family’s assets and savings to meet the current costs of living in Singapore. Prior to the breakdown of the marriage, the parties apparently spent an average of $38,000 per month. From September 2018, she said that the husband unilaterally reduced the family’s expenses and controlled the amounts given to her, restricting her allowance to $2,500 per month. He also cancelled an annual trip for the wife and the children to the UK in July 2018, suggested that the children’s extra-curricular activities be reduced to one activity per child and further proposed that expenses be cut drastically by about 40% to 50% for each child from the wife’s list of monthly expenses.

(b)     That the husband’s income has dipped approximately 80% since 2015 and he is earning an average income of $10,500 per month in 2016 and 2017. This means that he can no longer maintain the family at the monthly expenses she projected. The wife further submits that his income for 2018 has not been disclosed and submits that it is less than $10,500 per month.

(c)     That the husband’s employability will increase and he will earn a better income if he returns to the UK (because of his practice in the UK) and he can supplement his income in the UK with his arbitration practice in Asia while based in the UK.

(d)     That the husband’s reduction in income and the drawdown of the parties’ assets have an impact on the children’s material needs in that they will need to downgrade their lifestyle eg a reduction in the quality of fresh produce available to them which therefore compromises their nutritional health, the reduction in the number of extra-curricular activities available to the children, that they will not enjoy travels and there will be no budget for dining out, Christmas celebrations and birthday gifts, outings or entertainment. She also refers to the increase in school fees payable for the children as they progress in grades. She submits that a budget of $4,500 per month as rental (proposed by the husband) means they cannot live in the Bukit Timah area and will have to downgrade from a landed property to an apartment.

(e)     Conversely, the wife estimates that the costs of living in her proposed relocation venue in the county of Kent in the UK, to be lower and she estimates her monthly expenses at $10,377 per month as opposed to the $29,143 per month she needs in order to remain in Singapore. She says that she will save on costs of rental, that she will not require the assistance of a helper as she will be supported by her extended family members, that she qualifies for benefits and grants as a single parent and she will be able to get a job in the UK where she used to work in the civil service prior to coming to Singapore in February 2012.

(f)     The wife also submits that the parties never intended to live in Singapore on a long term basis and that she and the children do not have any ties or connections to Singapore.

(g)     Further, as the children’s primary caregiver, whilst she has been able to hold the fort, she is beginning to feel homesick and unhappy especially given the acrimony between the parties and that the children are likewise affected by the acrimony. As their primary caregiver, their welfare is intertwined with her well-being.

(h)     She has a clear relocation plan which includes housing, schooling and a wide range of extra-curricular activities for the children.

(i)     That the husband is an absent father who has a distant relationship with the children and as such, he is an uninvolved parent. In any event, she will be facilitative of access.

(j)     That relocation will remove the children from the toxic home environment created by the husband arising with the litigation process. She says it is urgent that the children be removed from this toxicity.

11     In response, the husband says as follows:

(a)     He disputes that the wife has a clear relocation plan including how she proposes to maintain the children and herself after relocation. He says there is no cogent and corroborated evidence or compelling evidence of housing, schooling, access terms to him if relocation is granted and, what the overall benefit is for the children over the life that they currently enjoy now in Singapore.

(b)     He raises concerns about the significant reduction of time the children will have with him if relocated and submits a loss of relationship with him as their father. As it is, the wife’s affidavits and submissions subverts the father-child relationship with allegations of him being a ‘absent’, ‘distant’ and/or ‘abusive’ father when parties and the children are in Singapore. He imagines that with the greater physical loss of relational contact with relocation will reinforce the wife’s alienation of the children from him.

(c)     He submits that the wife lacks evidence of the benefits and standard of living they will enjoy if relocated. He says that it is unrealistic of the wife to assume that the children and her will be immediately able to access a better material life in ‘rural England’ by applying for social welfare benefits and that the wife does not show what these benefits are. She refers to receiving social welfare payments but the husband says that she will be putting the children and herself in a financially precarious position so as to be eligible for these pay outs. He questions her motives for doing so especially when the children and her have a certain standard of living in Singapore.

(d)     He denies that the parties discussed relocating back to the UK and that the wife did not discuss this application with him until she filed proceedings.

(e)     That the relocation application that she filed was not ‘sincere’ as she had affirmed, in related proceedings, that she considered Singapore the children’s home. In any event, the children have lived in Singapore since their births and the parties just did not get around to applying for permanent residency status for the children. The husband says this is a matter of form in that it is an administrative detail as it will not be difficult to attain permanent residency status for the children. This will in turn entitle them to subsidies in terms of healthcare benefits and education expenses. There is therefore no need for the wife to have to relocate to ‘rural England’ and to apply for social welfare benefits.

(f)     Her reference and reliance on the family’s financial circumstances as a reason to relocate is not a valid reason especially when the husband has been providing for the family and paying the expenses incurred by the wife and the children, albeit not at the standard that the wife requires and imposes. The husband says that the wife has grossly inflated the family expenses in Singapore and in any event these expenses are uncorroborated whereas he has given evidence of actual prices and costs he incurs for the family. Her reliance on projected expenses in Kent in the UK cannot be relied on as it is self-serving and that much of the evidence is anecdotal, uncorroborated and unreliable as the quality of life is a subjective concept.

(g)     That allegations of her fragile emotional state is not borne out in evidence.

(h)     That it is in the children’s best interests for them to stay in Singapore, which is the only home they have known from birth.

(i)     The wife’s need for the support of family and friends with the relocation (because of the alleged strained marital relationship and the ensuing stress on her) contradicts her earlier admissions in related proceedings that she has a very good support network in Singapore and that her friendship group and support structure is superior to the one she has in the UK. In fact, her friends even file supporting affidavits on her behalf, lending credence to the supportive friendship group she has in Singapore.

## The law

12     I first consider the law in this area. The seminal decision is the case of _BNS_ v _BNT_ (‘_BNS_ v _BNT’_). In _BNS_ v _BNT_, the Court of Appeal set out legal principles which are summarized as follows:

(a)     The fundamental consideration is the welfare of the children and this overrides any other factors \[at paragraph 19\].

(b)     There is no pre-fixed precedence or hierarchy among the many composite factors as to where the child’s best interests ultimately lie: where these factors stand in relation to one another must depend, in the final analysis, on a consideration of all the factors in each case \[at paragraph 22\].

(c)     There is no legal presumption in favour of allowing relocation when the primary caregiver’s desire to relocate is not unreasonable or is not founded in bad faith \[at paragraph 22\].(d)The relocating parent’s reasonable wish to relocate is not relevant _per se_; however, if the primary caregiver reasonably wishes to relocate because he or she is not emotionally and psychologically stable in his or her present environment, that factor has to be weighed sensibly in the balance. Even when the primary caregiver is able to establish that he or she reasonably wishes to relocate in the best interests of the child, that is no more than just one of the factors to be considered in the overarching inquiry into the child’s welfare; it is not a singularly determinative factor \[paragraph 20, 21\].

(e)     The loss of relationship with the left-behind parent is also relevant as it is axiomatic that a child benefits from the nurturing presence and joint contributions of both parents and this does not cease to be true upon the breakdown of the marriage; however, whilst an important consideration, this too is not to be treated as a determinative weight or being decisive in every case. The facts of the case are relevant; in particular, the strength of the existing bond between the left-behind parent and the child and the stronger the bond, the weightier this factor must be in the overall analysis \[paragraph 25 and 26\].

## My decision

13     After considering the facts of this particular case and applying the applicable legal principles set out above as well as considering the various authorities submitted by counsel, I dismiss the application in its entirety and awarded costs of the application to the husband. My reasons are set out hereinafter.

## Singapore is the children’s home and the only home they know

14     The parties first moved to Singapore in February 2012 primarily because of the husband’s career plans. According to the wife, the intention was to stay here on a temporary basis; between 12 and 18 months from February 2012. However, it is pertinent to note that the wife did not clamour to return to the UK in 2013 after the expiry of the projected 12 to 18 months’ temporary stay as alluded to by her. It is not disputed that the parties have remained in Singapore since February 2012 and they have resided here for the past 7 years. The parties have not returned to the UK to reside for any length of time during the past 7 years.

15     The parties are permanent residents of Singapore. They took an active step to make Singapore their permanent residence and their actions and conduct are entirely consonant and consistent with that decision: both the children were born in Singapore and they have lived here since their births, the focus of the husband’s job is within Asia, they leased homes in Singapore and even engaged a full time foreign domestic worker.

16     The children were born in Singapore and lived here from birth. They know no other home. The fact that parties have not applied for permanent residency status for them is not impactful; this can be easily rectified and in any event, the children can be the husband’s dependants. According to the parties, there was in fact an attempt to apply for permanent residency status for the children but parties did not pursue the application with alacrity. Both parties had different versions of why this was so but in the overall factual matric, it is noteworthy that the children know no other homes save in Singapore.

17     I weighed the wife’s wish to relocate with its possible conflict with the children’s welfare of being uprooted from their stable living arrangements in Singapore and the only home they know. The wife may have genuine personal reasons to relocate but these reasons must take a backseat to the overriding consideration of the children’s welfare. It is relevant to therefore consider the factor of uprooting the children from their home as this cannot be considered to be in their best interests. Notwithstanding this statement, I also carefully considered the wife’s reasons for relocation and I will deal with these reasons; I accept that Singapore being the children’s only home is one of the many composite factors to be considered in deciding what is in the children’s best interests.

## The wife’s submission about the family’s impecuniosity and the children’s material needs must be considered in context

18     One of the main reasons for relocation is the wife’s assertion that the husband cannot afford to have the family remain in Singapore.

19     The wife referred to _UQN_ v _UQO_ in which a district judge allowed a father’s application to relocate to Norway as the father had accepted a new job, could not continue to afford the same standard of living for the children in Singapore and the children’s immigration status was not secured. She also referred to _UMR_ v _UMS_ in which a mother’s application to relocate to Germany was allowed because the court made a finding that there would be significant downgrade in the children’s lifestyle if they continued living in Singapore.

20     Drawing an analogy with the principles set out in the above 2 cases, the wife says the she should be allowed to relocate because of the family’s impecuniosity.

21     According to the wife, the total amount of assets has been drawn down upon between 20.7% to 27.9% in the last 2 to 3 years. She says that the husband’s income has dropped from 2015 and he earns about $10,500 per month, a 80% drop in his income. She also submits that the family used to spend $38,000 per month prior to the breakdown of the marriage in June 2018. From September 2018, the husband reduced the family expenses unilaterally including: cancelling the wife’s trip to the UK with the children, reducing the wife’s allowance to $2,500 per month and asking the wife to reduce the children’s extra-curricular activities to one activity per child. The wife says that she needs $29,143 per month to continue to live in Singapore and as the husband’s income cannot sustain this expense, she is to be allowed to relocate to Kent in the UK where her spending and/or expenses will be reduced to a more affordable amount of $10,277 per month.

22     I am of the view that the wife’s allegation of the family’s impecuniosity needs to be put into context. I explain. The wife’s use of the word ‘impecuniosity’ as being reflective of the family’s financial situation is highly inaccurate. This family is neither penniless or living hand to mouth as the word suggests. The husband has disposable income of $10,500 per month plus $7,500 per month from rental of his property in the UK. According to the husband, he assesses the family’s financial needs in the region of $18,833 per month and he has asserted that he can pay the expenses at $18,833 per month. With this disposable income of $18,000 per month, the husband pays the rental of 2 residences, (one for the wife and the children and one for himself), the elder child’s fees and one extra-curricular activity per child, all their living expenses such as food, groceries, clothes, shoes, transport etc. This is not a family who is impecunious.

23     The wife’s concept of the family’s impecuniosity is given in examples of what she considers as a downgrading of the family’s standard of living including: a reduced budget for fresh produce which she can provide to the children, a concern that the children will not be able to afford full time nursery in the near future, that the children will no longer enjoy activities such as ballet lessons for the elder child and music lessons for both children, that they cannot afford to send the children to camps or holiday activities, that they are now living in a condominium instead of a landed property in which the children used to enjoy especially playing on the porch and, the lack of holidays. She further states that the children’s peers are accustomed to a high standard of living and because of this downgrading, the children will be cut off from their expatriate community.

24     I considered the wife’s points above. This is not a case in which the husband says that he cannot maintain the family in Singapore but rather a case in which the wife is claiming certain expenses which she says the husband cannot provide. She submits that this led to a lowering of standard of living for the children eg not staying in a landed property, not having a certain standard of fresh produce, milk, cheese and yogurt which somehow has affected the children’s nutrition and not being able to travel etc. The husband has said in his affidavits that he can maintain the family up to $18,833 per month. It may well be that the wife may have to adjust her estimated expenses of $29,143 per month but as they are, I do not see that the family is ‘impecunious’ as alleged by the wife and/or that the children’s material needs are so adversely that their welfare is compromised. There is no evidence that they are falling ill frequently as a result of having to compromise on the standard of cheese, yoghurt and milk they are used to. As for the continuation of their extra-curricular activities, I am of the view this is not substantive enough to warrant relocation as there are many activities that children can be exposed to which may not attract fees or additional costs.

25     The question that has to be asked is: whether it is in the children’s best interests to relocate to Kent in the UK where the wife says that the costs of living is lower and where the children will enjoy what she says the husband is depriving them of with $18,833 per month.

26     After considering the evidence, I am of the view that it may not in the children’s best interests to relocate to Kent on the factor of the lower costs of living.

27     I reviewed the wife’s projected expenses for Kent as set out in her affidavit of 9 November 2018 pages 34 to 39. She claims that she will be entitled to free healthcare for herself and the children and free education expenses for the children. She also says she _may_ (paragraph 65) qualify for home improvement grants, discretionary housing payments, boiler grants, free school meals etc and that she is _likely to be entitled_ (paragraph 66) child benefits of GBP34.40 per week, universal credit and council tax supports. I considered her claims and I am of the view that it is certainly not in the children’s best interests to depend on these possibilities which are founded in a lack of certainty. This is especially so when we have a father/husband who has been providing for the family albeit not at the standard the wife is seeking.

28     I have earlier said something about the wife’s list of expenses at $29,143 per month which she projects to continue to live in Singapore. It must be noted that if she relocated to Kent, the children and her will likewise not be residing in a landed property with a porch for them to play in, that she will be dependent on welfare or social benefits for education expenses or housing, that she will still have to cut down on the amounts that she claims for groceries ($2,800 per month for her and 2 young children) and other unnecessary expenses such as eating out, entertainment, fitness classes and trainers, holidays etc. Simply put, it appears that the children will be better off staying on in Singapore with a trimming down of the wife’s expenses.

29     I also reviewed the husband’s review of the expenses for the family at pages 40 to 49 of his affidavit of 20 December 2018. The husband has pointed out the discrepancies in the wife’s expenses such as using a sum of $7,300 per month for rent, asked the wife to consider a reduced sum of $1,800 per month for groceries for herself and the 2 young children, cutting down the wife’s claim for clothes, entertainment, fitness classes, holiday expenses etc (non-essential items). He projects their expenses in Singapore to be in the region of $10,000 to $11,000 per month and I do not find anything untoward about that estimate for the wife and the 2 young children. They live in an apartment and the children continue to go to their usual classes (save that the husband requests they cut down on certain extra-curricular activities), their healthcare and daily living expenses are taken care of and he has also projected holiday expenses for them.

30     The figure the husband is paying in Singapore ($10,484 to $11,458 per month) is not very different from the sum the wife claims she needs to live in Kent (of $10,277 per month) but with the additional uncertainty of reliance on social and welfare benefits. In all the circumstances, I cannot see how it is in the children’s welfare to be uprooted from Singapore to move to Kent where they have never lived, at much the same costs the husband is to pay (with the additional caveat of the wife’s reliance on welfare and social benefits) when the husband is prepared to pay and is paying much the same amount in Singapore.

31     I finalize this point about the financial issues relied on by the wife with distinguishing the 2 cases referred to by her as set out in paragraph 19 above. In _UQN_ v _UQO_ , the husband was terminated from his job in Singapore. He had difficulties staying on in Singapore as a result. This is completely different from this case. In this case, the husband has certainly not lost his job; the family has been living in Singapore with his income of $18,000 per month _from 2016_ (emphasis mine) and the parties are permanent residents. The wife’s unhappiness only manifested itself more obviously in 2018 as the husband requested her to cut down on non-essential items. In _UMR_ v _UMS_ \[2018\] SGFC, the wife likewise lost her well-paying job in Singapore and attractive expatriate benefits. The parties had tenuous links to Singapore as they were not permanent residents. By relocating to Germany, the wife in that case would be able to continue to work with her current employers at a senior level and to draw a salary that would be able to sustain the expatriate lifestyle the family had in Singapore. Again, the facts are distinguishable – in this case, the husband has not lost his job nor is he saying that he cannot support the wife and the children.

32     The husband in this case has spent the last 7 years building up his practice in the Singapore and Asia Pacific region and if the family is to relocate and he to return to the UK (which is what the wife proposes for him), he will lose much of the goodwill and clientele he has taken pains to build up here. The husband has left the UK and way of practice there for the last 7 years and it may well be more difficult for him to rebuild his career in the UK as opposed to the international arbitration work he is undertaking here, in a job that has managed to sustain the family all this time. Hence, contrasted with the 2 other spouses in the 2 cases referred to by the wife, his career prospects and job opportunities continue to reside in Asia.

33     Accordingly, this factor of the family’s impecuniosity does not support the wife’s case.

## The wife’s reliance on how her sense of well-being has been affected is not a compelling factor

34     The wife refers to her sense of well-being being adversely affected by the tensions between the husband and herself. On the evidence, the breakdown of the marital relationship seemed to have occurred in 2018; prior to that, the marriage seemed to have weathered well save for the usual wears and tears intrinsic in most marriages. The issue pertaining to the children’s access has been resolved with the parties reaching some form of agreement. The wife’s reference to how her well-being is affected by the contact she has with the husband is also no longer an issue. Handovers at access can be as amicable or as tense as parties intend and parties will do well to recognize that they are very much in control of this process. As it is, the parties now live separate and apart from December 2018.

35     As for her familial support in the UK, we need to be cognizant of the fact that she has been in Singapore for the past 7 years and it is highly likely that she will have her own support group as well as friends here. As set out earlier, her wide extent of friendship groups led to them filing affidavits on her behalf. Whilst much can be said about familial support, there is nothing stopping her family from coming here and the wife is also able to make trips back to the UK as well. Her well-being is one of the many factors that the court takes into account in deciding relocation and my view is that it is not so affected that she needs to relocate home with the children, taking them from the only home they have known from birth.

## The wife can have a career in Singapore

36     The wife says that she will have better career prospects in the UK. However, I see no good reason why she will not have a decent career path here as well. The wife is a qualified English barrister and she has worked as in-house counsel. She did work for a spell and according to her, she can work as a paralegal with a monthly income of about $5,000 to $6,000 per month. The husband made some queries and has proposed that she can possibly earn an income range of $6,000 to $10,000 per month. This income she can possibly earn is not a meagre or scanty sum and is something that she can definitely take into account in considering employment opportunities in Singapore. Added to that, for a number of years, she has been running the parties’ chocolate company.

37     As it is, the older child is in school for a good part of the day and the wife has the assistance of a full time helper. If she has qualms about leaving the younger child with the helper for a large part of the day, she can work part time.

38     The wife has since informed that she no longer has a full time helper under her employ. However, this still does not stop the wife from working part time and in any event, the wife has stated that as part of her relocation plan she does not intend to work until the children are settled and/or then she will work part time. There is no reason why she cannot put these plans into fruition here. Her care plan here seems more settled than the reliance on her siblings with their own family and work schedules and an apparent dependence on her parents who have to travel to Kent to assist in childcare arrangements. She also builds in the costs of a part time sitter for the children if she relocates and this can also be something she can consider in Singapore. The husband who can be called upon if needs be; he is, after all, the children’s father.

39     Considering that the wife has not worked in the UK for the past 7 years and she has not been in full time employment since 2010, her career prospects in the UK does not appear to be as imminent as she paints it to be. She refers to resuming a position in the UK Civil Service but the reality is that she worked in the Registry of a district court and she worked as personal assistant to a High Court judge, both positions more than 10 years ago. In 2011, she applied to join the UK Civil Service and was accepted but she declined the position to move to Singapore. The position was offered and not taken up and it has been almost 8 years since that position was offered.

40     In all the circumstances, the facts support her seeking full time employment in Singapore and if she wants a career in the legal industry, she can possibly earn a decent income. There is really no reason why she cannot work in Singapore and pursue her career prospects here.

## The wife’s reference to accommodation and education benefits are not compelling enough to order relocation to Kent

41     I see no advantage in the wife uprooting the children from the only home they have ever known to stay in a room with her siblings in Kent. Her reliance on some form of benefits which the wife says she can only realise after she goes over to the UK is also worrisome taken in context with the certainty of lifestyle they have in Singapore. She has referred to the possibility of housing allowance, home improvement grants, discretionary housing payments, boiler grants etc but these will apply only if she purchases a property. She refers to free school meals and child benefits of GBP34.40 per week but it is not clear whether she qualifies for these benefits. It is certainly not in the children’s best interests to depend on these possibilities which are founded in a lack of certainty.

42     The wife has expressed her intention is to buy a small place upon the resolution of the ancillary matters. There is no certainty of the amount that she will realise and whilst she is dealing with the ancillary matters, she continues to stay in a decent good sized apartment paid for by the husband in a reputable area in Singapore. The older child is already attending school here and the younger child can join his sister when he is older. The parties may have intentions of primary schools for the children in the UK as alleged by the wife but things have changed; they are now in Singapore and they have made a life here. In any event, it will be another 3 to 4 years before they consider primary schools.

43     These reasons of accommodation, education and other benefits cited by the wife are not compelling factors to order relocation.

## The husband’s loss of relationship with the children if relocation is allowed

44     One of the most compelling factor to consider is the loss of relationship between the husband and the children if relocation is allowed.

45     The wife’s position on this is that the husband is a distant parent and that he works and he travels for his work. However, the wife must recognise that both parties play their respective roles in the marital relationship. The roles adopted by the parties are roles they cast themselves in since marriage and more so, since they came to Singapore. The wife is a stay home mum and she is the children’s primary care giver. But she has to give credit to the role played by the husband: he is the one earning the income which enables her to stay at home to be with the children. I do not agree with the view that his relationship with the children is distant as a result. The family unit was in fact intact until December 2018 when the parties maintained separate homes.

46     The husband’s issues with access coincided with the breakdown of the marital relationship. The wife attempted to make out a case to say that the husband caused the children some form of hurt and she filed an application for PPOs for herself as well as the children. After hearing the parties, I dismissed her applications as I was of the view that she could not make out a case. I made a finding that the children’s distress if any eg elder child crying was a direct consequence of the situational conflict and the fact that they were present when the parties argued or disagreed, usually about access issues. Much of the situational conflict involving the children has been removed with the separating of their households.

47     The husband has set out his involvement with the children in his affidavits filed in reply to the wife’s application for relocation. The husband has also detailed the difficulties he has had with access or when he requests additional time with the children. He has set these instances in his affidavit of 20 December 2018 at paragraphs 132 to 166. The wife has also called the police to the home when she disagreed with the husband over access issues.

48     However, the access issue was resolved with counsel’s assistance and the wife also agreed to unsupervised overnight access. That being the case, it does not appear that the husband has a distant relationship with the children.

49     If relocation is to occur, the husband will lose the physical contact he has with the children, both of whom are very young. This contact is something the Court recognized as important and I refer to paragraph 35(c) of _BNT_ v _BNS_ in which the Honourable Justice Judith Prakash said:

_“With younger children, closeness is promoted by physical contact and frequent interaction in routine activities. Telephone and internet access are frequently unsatisfactory due to technical difficulties and generally permit only one type of interaction (i.e communication). Normal family life consists of much more than just conversations between parent and child.”_

50     The children in this case are very young: 4 and 2 years old. It is important for them not to lose the physical relational contact with the husband. Coupled with the spate of correspondences by the parties complaining about access issues, I am concerned that allowing relocation will cement the wife’s gatekeeping of access. The wife’s usage of words such as ‘allowing access’; that the husband can spend time with the children in Kent ‘if it does not interfere with the key aspects of their schedule’ and her own admission that the children are not engaged in video calls (see paragraph 104 of the wife’s affidavit of 9 November 2018) etc do not stir confidence that access will be meaningful once there is relocation. I can do no more than reiterate the findings in _BNS_ v _BNT_ at paragraph 34 that whilst technology is available, it is preferable, given the nature of the relationship, for the children to have personal contact with the father in that case.

51     The wife’s reliance on isolated incidents of the children crying when there is an access issue has been debunked with the findings I made at the trial of her application for PPOs. The children have overnight access with the husband and other weekly access. The husband’s attempt to have additional access seems to have been met with resistance by the wife and there is a real concern that with relocation, the contact will be even more fraught with difficulties.

52     The potential loss of this relationship is a factor that weighed heavily against relocation by the wife as the loss a very real possibility.

## Concluding remarks

53     An application for relocation is fact-centric and must be considered against the unique set of facts of each case. Having traversed the reasons set out by the wife, I am not satisfied that the many composite factors relied upon by her negate the welfare principle in this case, which is, it is in the children’s best interests to remain in Singapore.

54     Taken as a whole, her reliance on claims such as the family’s impecuniosity, the benefits she will enjoy in Kent, her sense of well-being, and her career prospects are not compelling enough to override the overriding consideration of the children’s best interests as detailed in my grounds.

55     I therefore dismiss the application with costs to the husband.
