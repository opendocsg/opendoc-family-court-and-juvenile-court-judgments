Family Law – Maintenance – Variation of child maintenance order – Variation of consent order

14 April 2021

### District Judge Azmin Jailani:

1       Summons No. 2143 of 2020 (“SUM 2143”) was the defendant-father’s application for a downward variation of child maintenance from $1,300 per month for the 3 children of the marriage to $350 per month with effect from 1 August 2020. After hearing parties, I was only inclined to grant a _temporary_ downward variation of $960 from the period of August 2020 to February 2021 (i.e., 6 months). Thereafter, the amount of child maintenance would revert back to the original sum of $1300 from March 2021. At that hearing, I provided brief reasons for my decision.

2       Dissatisfied, the defendant filed the present appeal. Against that backdrop, I now set out my reasons in full.

## Background to the Dispute

### Parties

3       Parties were married on 21 January 1999.

4       There are 3 children to the marriage (“Child 1”, “Child 2”, and “Child 3” respectively, and collectively, the “Children”). Child 1 and Child 2, both males, were born in June 2011. Child 3, the youngest daughter, was born in September 2013. As at the date of the hearing, Child 1 and 2 were 9 years old, whilst Child 3 was 7 years old.

5       The plaintiff-mother commenced divorce proceedings in June 2015. The defendant filed his defence and counterclaim in July 2015. Interim Judgment was granted on both the plaintiff’s claim and the defendant’s counterclaim in March 2016. The ancillary matters were adjourned to a later date.

### ORC 3310/2017 and the Maintenance Order

6       The ancillary matters were contested, and orders were made on 24 March 2017 (ORC 3310/2017, or “ORC 3310”). For the purposes of this judgment, paragraph 3(e) of ORC 3310 provides that:

> Maintenance for the children

> The Defendant shall pay $1,300.00 as maintenance for the 3 children of the marriage from 1 April 2017 and thereafter on the 1st of each subsequent month. The payment is to be made into the Plaintiff’s POSB Savings Account No. XXX-XXXXX-X.

> \[the “Maintenance Order”\]

7       I pause here and make the following observations regarding the Maintenance Order:

> (a)     It was not readily apparent from ORC 3310 the specific proportion of the aggregate sum of $1300 to be allocated to each of the Children. Neither party submitted on the breakdown. That said, given the Children’s relatively close age gap (i.e., 2 years between the twins and Child 3), I was of the view that it was not unreasonable to equally apportion the sum. This would amount to approximately $433 per child.

> (b)     Whilst the ancillary matters were contested, I note that the defendant specifically _agreed_ to the Maintenance Order. This admission is clear in his supporting affidavit filed together with his summons.[^1] Accordingly, for all intents and purposes, the Maintenance Order, in itself, was a _consent order_.

8       For the reasons highlighted below, the defendant commenced SUM 2143 on 6 August 2020. This was approximately 3 years after ORC 3310 was made.

## Documents filed by parties

9       For the purposes of these proceedings, parties filed the following documents:

## Parties’ cases

### Defendant’s case

10     The defendant’s application is to reduce child maintenance from $1300 per month (i.e., approximately $433 per child) to $350 per month (i.e., $116 per child). In relative terms, the defendant is essentially asking for a 73% reduction in his obligation to pay child maintenance in perpetuity.

11     In support of his application, the defendant makes the following points:

> (a)     The defendant is working as a private hire driver. At the time he consented to the Maintenance Order, his gross earning was approximately $6000 per month. This excludes perks such as (i) a ‘driver’s incentive’ of $520 per month, and (ii) car rental rebate of $480 per month.

> (b)     After factoring these perks, this amounts to a total earning of $7000 per month.[^3]

> (c)     After deducting the private hire company’s (“PHC”) commission (i.e., 20% of his $6,000 earnings) and daily car rental of $79 per day, the defendant’s take home pay was approximately $3430.[^4] After further deducting what he lists as being his personal expenses of $2200[^5] (assuming I accepted his evidence completely), this leaves him with a balance sum of $1230.

> (d)     Against that backdrop, and on _his own_ narrative, the defendant consciously agreed to the Maintenance Order (i.e., $1300). This is despite the apparent deficit of $700 (i.e., $1300 - $1230). Notwithstanding this, the defendant consciously agreed to the Maintenance Order “because \[he\] loved\[ed\] \[his\] Children and \[did\] not want them to fall short of what they might need”[^6].

> (e)     To cover the deficit, the defendant apparently borrowed money from his friends and his family members. To the extent that the defendant indicated that he _consciously agreed_ to the Maintenance Order and knew (or ought to have known) that he may not have been in a position to fully comply with it, I pause her and found it apposite to highlight that this was a burden _borne out of design rather than circumstance_.

> (f)     To manage his expenses, the defendant moved to Johor Bahru in 2017 shortly after ORC 3310.[^7] While that may have alleviated the situation somewhat, it appears that the trade-off was the daily commute.

> (g)     For the purposes of these proceedings, sometime in October 2018, the defendant highlighted that there was a change in the policies and incentive payments of the PHC which led to a “drastic reduction in \[his\] earnings”.[^8] In this regard:

>> (i)       First, the PHC first ceased giving drivers the rental rebate.[^9]

>> (ii)       Second, and more pertinent to his application, related to the change in the policy on driver’s incentives. In this regard, the PHC would only issue ‘gems’ (valued at $0.50 per ‘gem’[^10]) depending on the nature of the trips performed by the driver (i.e., peak hours and etc). Additionally, there was now a minimum number of ‘gems’ (i.e., 140 ‘gems’[^11]) which had to be earned before a driver receives the benefits of that incentive.

> (h)     The effect of the second policy change was that before October 2018, it was easier for drivers to obtain ‘gems’, and there was apparently no minimum quantity of ‘gems’ which had to be obtained before receiving the full value of that incentive. Under the previous policy and as highlighted above, the defendant was able to earn $520 worth of driver incentives (i.e., 1040 ‘gems’ per months).

> (i)     However, because of this change in the policy of driver incentives, the defendant apparently could not “collect enough gems to receive any incentives”[^12]. I pause here and note that on the defendant’s own evidence, it would appear that he was now _not_ even able to obtain the minimum quota of 140 ‘gems’, as opposed to when he could previously earn in excess of 1000 ‘gems’ per month under the old policy.

> (j)     The upshot of the PHC’s policy change is that the defendant’s earning income ‘dropped’ by $1000 (i.e., the rental rebate and the ‘loss’ of the driver’s incentive). In this connection, the defendant highlighted how he had to borrow money to cover for the rental of the vehicle he was using.[^13]

> (k)     This had a knock-on effect on his existing deficit, resulting in him not being able to fully satisfy the Maintenance Order. Against that backdrop, it would not have been surprising that the defendant would incur more debts in order to satisfy the Maintenance Order, as well as an increase in the arrears which had accrued because of this reduced income. In this connection, the defendant highlighted how he has been involved in separate enforcement proceedings commenced by the plaintiff. These enforcement proceedings have resulted in him having to make instalment payments to make up to the accrued arrears _in addition to_ the current amounts stated in the Maintenance Order.

> (l)     To exacerbate the situation, the defendant’s income had fallen further during (i) June 2019 to December 2019[^14] (although the defendant noticeably provided no documentation of his earnings during that period of time), and (ii) the ‘Circuit Breaker’ period from April 2020 to June 2020. While he did receive certain forms of relief during the ‘Circuit Breaker’ period, the defendant highlighted that his daily earnings during that period of time went as low as $68.[^15] He did however supplement his income by taking up ad-hoc odd jobs whenever he could.[^16]

> (m)     In terms of his expenses, because of the ‘Circuit Breaker’ period and the corresponding ‘Movement Control Order’ instituted by the Malaysian government, the defendant was not able to return to Johore Bahru. This in turn meant that he was stuck in Singapore, and because of that, had to rent a room in Singapore _as well as_ pay for his Malaysia accommodation.[^17]

> (n)     In further narrating his unfortunate circumstances, the defendant also highlighted how he was involved in a car accident in May 2020. Because of the accident, an amount of $953 had to be withheld being excess expenses claimed by the third party.[^18] Additionally, the defendant further mentioned the bank loan debts he incurred during the course of the marriage. That said, I note that these were debts were incurred _before_ he agreed to the Maintenance Order.[^19]

> (o)     In light of the foregoing, the defendant sought to underscore his poor financial situation, and stated that:

>> I am barely able to sustain my needs and it is important that I obtain a variation of the \[Maintenance Order\] downwards _so that I could get back to better financial health_.

>> (emphasis added)

> Put another way, the defendant appeared to treat the present application as a stop-gap measure to allow him the space to improve his financial position.

12     After highlighting his financial issues, the defendant then turned his attention towards the plaintiff. He essentially contended that the plaintiff has a stable income of between $3000 to $4000 from her job at a pharmaceutical company. In other words, the defendant contended that the plaintiff was well in position to cover the difference arising from his application. In this regard, the defendant made the following comments:[^20]

> Since our divorce, I have asked the Plaintiff on her earning capacity, but she has refused to disclose to me. The Plaintiff is constantly pressuring me to pay the \[Maintenance Order\] and not taking into consideration of my present financial circumstances, which I feel is partly out of her grudge against me. I had then agreed to and consented to the \[Maintenance Order\]. I am well aware that the Children are growing up in a broken family, and I do not want them to suffer further. I also want to be responsible father. Because of this innocent commitment, it appears that the Plaintiff has the upper hand and would constantly use this against me and dragging me to the enforcement court as and when she feels like it.

### Plaintiff’s case

13     The plaintiff’s narrative and response to the defendant’s contentions were broadly as follows:

> (a)     At the outset, the plaintiff constantly reiterated the fact that the defendant _agreed and consented to_ the Maintenance Order.

> (b)     Contrary to the defendant’s narrative, the payment of the Maintenance Order was not premised on his private hire earnings[^21] (unsurprisingly, the defendant disputes this[^22]). The plaintiff clarified the context behind ORC 3310, and highlighted that the court hearing the ancillary matters ordered that she was to pay the sum of $131,000 into the defendant’s CPF account on the basis that she was to take over repayment of the outstanding loan of the matrimonial flat. It was against that context that the defendant, in turn, would pay her the sums stated in the Maintenance Order.[^23]

> (c)     In short, the Maintenance Order appeared to be the _quid pro quo_ for the plaintiff’s transfer of $131,000 into the defendant’s CPF account for taking over the matrimonial flat (and more importantly, the housing loan).

> (d)     The plaintiff also highlighted how the defendant was being inconsistent in setting out his true earnings position.[^24] Whilst the defendant asserted his $7000 income “during the time of the divorce, and even up to now”[^25], in his affidavit of assets and means for the ancillary matters, the defendant had listed his income as being only $2500.[^26] In his reply affidavit for the present application, the defendant sought to clarify his position by saying that the $2500 amount was a combined income of “running a food court business”[^27] as well as being a private hire driver. Separately, the defendant also sought to clarify that instead of $1000, his incentives ranged “between $670.00 to $830.00 per month”[^28].

> (e)     As regards his expenses, the plaintiff took issue as to the financial prudence of living in Johore Bahru, when he could have properly utilised the $131,000 that he obtained under ORC 3310.[^29] The plaintiff also highlighted the defendant’s malfeasance when it came to financial matters,[^30] as well as his prior poor performance that led to his termination at a construction engineering firm.[^31] As regards the defendant living in Johore Bahru, the defendant said the following:

>> I wish to state that I have intentions to move back from Johor Bahru to Singapore to seek employment. In the past few months, I have been actively corresponding with e2i Employment and Employability Institute to seek a job in Singapore.[^32]

> The upshot of this was that the defendant would no longer require his premises in Johore Bahru, and consequently no longer incur expenses on the same.

> (f)     With regard to the defendant’s narrative on a drop of his income, the plaintiff highlighted how there was little cogent evidence to properly explain this purported drop.[^33] Moreover, the plaintiff highlighted how the plaintiff has one business in Malaysia[^34], and another business in Singapore dealing with polishing of metals and formed products[^35] (both of which the defendant did not deny). Against the backdrop of the numerous business ventures and driving as a private hire, the plaintiff simply stated that:

>> … \[the defendant\] still stating that he is in debt and that he does not make enough monies as a \[private hire driver\] to pay the \[Maintenance Order\] does not make any sense.[^36]

> (g)     Insofar as the defendant suggested that he was prompt in paying the Maintenance Order, the plaintiff refuted this by stating that the defendant had failed to pay this sum _ever since the \[Maintenance Order\] was made_. After “willing to put up with \[the defendant\] and his various excuses”, the plaintiff finally commenced the first enforcement application in August 2018.[^37] In his response, the defendant simply stated that it was not that he did not want to pay, but that he had “always endeavoured to pay of the \[Maintenance Order\]”[^38].

> (h)     With regard to the defendant’s contention of the plaintiff’s purportedly better financial circumstances, she highlighted, among other things, that:

>> (i)       she was laid off not long after the conclusion of the divorce proceedings;[^39]

>> (ii)       she was similarly debt-ridden by taking over the loan of the matrimonial property;[^40]

>> (iii)       there was uncertainty in her own employment in light of COVID-19;[^41]

>> (iv)       she has to deal with expenses relating to her mother’s psychiatric condition;[^42]

>> (v)       she is singularly having to struggle with the children’s increasing expenses;[^43] and

>> (vi)       amidst all this, she has had to endure the frustration of having to chase the defendant for the sums under the Maintenance Order, sums which the defendant agreed to pay.

14     In conclusion, the plaintiff highlighted that:[^44]

> Meanwhile, with the debts, increasing expenses, and sudden emergencies I had to cope with, I never had once asked for extra maintenance from the Defendant nor ever thought of varying \[ORC 3310\] to increase the maintenance amount. All I need from him therefore is just regular payment from him and that will be enough.

> Anyway, I hold no grudges against the defendant, it is just a genuine situation whereby I can barely cope with the family’s monthly expenses. Thus with irregular or no payment from him in terms of maintenance, I have had to apply for enforcement orders each time as soon as possible a I know fully well that the process will take about 1-2 months to process and I could get paid only after that.

> If given a choice, I would gladly take up and \[sic\] additional job and work harder to take care of my family expenses. Unfortunately, I am unable to do it as I have to take care of 3 children and my mother and the household and as such I do need the Defendant to pay the $1300 as maintenance for the children regularly.

### Plaintiff’s subsequent disclosure of additional documents requested by the defendant after the filing of parties’ affidavits

15     At this juncture, I found it apposite to note that this case was somewhat peculiar in that it was only (a) _after_ the filing of parties’ affidavits; (b) 4 days before the deadline of the written submissions; and (c) less than 2 weeks before the hearing that the defendant’s solicitors, on 5 October 2020, wrote to the plaintiff’s solicitors seeking disclosure of a not insignificant amount of documents, specifically:

> (a)     the plaintiff’s list of monthly expenses;

> (b)     the list of monthly expenses for the children;

> (c)     “documents and receipts to provide monthly expenses”;

> (d)     documents to prove the plaintiff’s debts;

> (e)     the plaintiff’s “payslips and CPF statements for the last 6 months”;

> (f)     the plaintiff’s evidence of employment;

> (g)     the plaintiff’s IRAS notice of assessment for the past 3 years; and

> (h)     the plaintiff’s “updated bank passbooks and/or updated bank statements”.[^45]

16     I found this particularly late request odd, especially given that the sufficiency (or lack thereof) of the plaintiff’s documents could have been raised at the relevant case conference after the plaintiff’s affidavit was filed. Furthermore, had this information been raised at the case conference on 17 September 2020 (6 days after P1 was filed), the tone and nature of the defendant’s final affidavit in reply (and perhaps his prayers) might have been different. Furthermore, the defendant would have been able to properly respond, by way of an affidavit and not _via_ submissions, the additional documents disclosed by the plaintiff.

17     Indeed, with this additional information, the defendant would have been able to assess (or at least respond, on affidavit) what the children’s reasonable expenses were, and consequentially justify why the amount he was seeking in this application (i.e., $350 per month or approximately $116 per child) was reasonable. As elaborated below, it would be fairly clear that the defendant’s position was problematic.

18     Be that as it may, and despite the short notice given, it is worth mentioning that the plaintiff was able to (although not obliged to) provide all of the categories of documents requested. This was done _vide_ the plaintiff’s solicitors’ letter of 8 October 2020 (3 days after the defendant’s request and on the eve of the deadline for the filing of written submissions).[^46] Whilst not in the form of an affidavit, it did not appear that the defendant was objecting to its inclusion as part of the record of these proceedings. Indeed, the defendant made certain submissions on these documents in his written submissions.

19     I pause here and highlight some of the more salient points of the plaintiff’s disclosed documents:

> (a)     In the Expenses Sheet[^47], the plaintiff lists the following monthly expenses:

> (b)     From her income documents[^48], the plaintiff’s nett monthly income is $4558.

20     Against that backdrop, I now provide my findings and analysis.

## Analysis and findings

### General principles

21     I start first with a brief recapitulation of the relevant legal principles. As regards the law on variation of child maintenance, counsel for the defendant, Ms Shone, graciously referred to my summary in _UYH v UVI_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGFC 73</span> (at \[42\]) in her written submissions. For ease of reference, the said summary is reproduced here:

> 42    There is no dispute that the relevant statutory provisions dealing with the variation of child maintenance orders applicable to the present case is sections 127 read with 72 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353). It is also fairly trite that at the heart of any application to vary a maintenance order for children is the following:

>> (a)    First, the comparison between the facts present at the time when the original maintenance order was made with the facts now facing the court at the variation proceedings, and whether such facts were sufficiently “material” or constituted “good cause” to justify the variation sought.

>> (b)    Second, the financial needs of the child, and to ensure that the welfare of the child, being of paramount importance, was not affected by any variation (of lack thereof) of the maintenance.

>> (c)    Flowing from the second point is that any maintenance order must, invariably, have regard to the payer’s financial capability. As much as the welfare of the child ought to be preserved, if the payer is unable to shoulder the full (or his/her equal share of the) burden of the child’s financial needs, any order or maintenance cannot be such so as to effectively debilitate the payer from conducting his/her own affairs.

>> (d)    Lastly, the analysis of all these factors is a holistic and fact-sensitive exercise to be applied to the facts of each case before the Court.

22     Additionally, and for the purposes of this application, I also found it apposite to reiterate that the Maintenance Order is a _consent order_. There is a need to ensure, in accordance with parties’ legitimate expectations, that they be held accountable to and fulfil the respective ends of their own self-concluded bargains. It would only be under sufficiently new and material circumstances that the court may appropriately moderate their bargains. To my mind, it would be necessary to be more circumspect and review these circumstances more acutely, more so in a case as the present as it deals with _child_ maintenance. This would be consistent with the principles enunciated above on ensuring that the welfare of the child is not unduly affected arising from the change in parties’ bargain. Even if there were circumstances warranting a variation, the law ensures that any negative impact towards the children is appropriately managed and not unduly prolonged, with a view of ensuring that _both_ parents adequately resume their equitable share of providing and caring for their child(ren).

### Does the defendant’s financial circumstances warrant a variation of the Maintenance Order?

#### Preliminary points

23     Turning to the present case, the crux of the defendant’s application is his reduced income as a private hire driver. Before I deal with this principal aspect of the defendant’s case, I make the following observations in respect of the other contentions raised by the defendant:

> (a)     First, insofar as the defendant appears to have accepted the Maintenance Order when he was not in a secure financial position to do so, I had stated earlier that this was a burden he consciously chose to place on himself. Since the defendant consciously agreed to enter into a bargain which would financially strain him and conceivably cause him to “go beyond \[his\] means”[^49], he cannot expect to come before this court now for assistance to extricate himself from his own decision. Whilst I am heartened that his exposure (at least on his evidence) was borne out of love for the Children, it could not, in itself, constitute a factor warranting this court’s intervention. It bears mentioning at this juncture that nowhere in the defendant’s evidence did he mention that the amounts in the Maintenance Order was excessive.

> (b)     Second, and related to the above, insofar as the defendant was in debt before the Maintenance Order and was incurring more debts because of his decision to agree to the Maintenance Order, this also could not constitute a factor warranting the variation of the Maintenance Order. This situation would have been a reasonably foreseeable or conceivable consequence of the defendant’s conscious decision to agree to the Maintenance Order. Put another way, by agreeing to the Maintenance Order, the defendant had consciously placed himself in a financially uncertain position such that it would be susceptible to _any change in circumstance_.

> (c)     To clarify, it is not my view that it is a general or rigid rule that a party’s subsequent deteriorating financial position arising predominantly from the decision to overstretch oneself in agreeing to a particular maintenance order can never be a ground to vary the order. I was not satisfied, on the facts of this case, that that alone justified the court’s intervention. This is a timely reminder for parties to ensure that they are clear of the nature and consequence of any agreement or concession they make, especially when it becomes a court order.

#### The defendant’s reduced income

24     Returning to the defendant’s principal case of his reduced income as a private hire driver, I make the following observations:

> (a)     After assessing the defendant’s evidence, I had some difficulty accepting the fact and/or extent of his reduction in income, and whether it could be attributed predominantly to the change in the PHC’s incentive policies.

> (b)     To recap, it was the defendant’s evidence that “as a change in \[the PHC’s\] policies and incentive payments, \[this resulted\] in a drastic reduction in \[his\] earnings.”[^50] As highlighted above, the defendant focused his arguments on the change in the ‘gems’ policy, and how he “\[does\] not collect enough gems to receive any incentives”[^51].

> (c)     On his own evidence, the defendant stated that he was earning up to $520 in ‘gem’ incentives. At $0.50 per ‘gem’, that would amount to 1040 ‘gems’. Even on his revised figure of incentives in this reply affidavit[^52], the defendant would conceivably be able to earn a significant number of ‘gems’, and in any event, more than the base 140 ‘gems’ required to qualify for an incentive payment under the new policy.

> (d)     Against that backdrop, I found it curious how, from being able to earn in excess of 1000 ‘gems’, the defendant could not even earn 140 gems to obtain some kind of incentive. In any case, the defendant’s ‘gems’ incentive accounts for up to $520 of his takings. However, when reviewing the comparison table of the defendant’s takings before and after the policy change (i.e., before October 2018 and in the year 2020)[^53], the reduced amount was far greater than that. As I highlighted earlier, the defendant did not provide documentary evidence relating to his takings in 2019.

> (e)     The plaintiff contends that this gives rise to a suspicion as to whether the drop in income was really due to a policy change or to the defendant’s own performance.[^54] Further, at the hearing, the plaintiff’s counsel, Mr Selvaraj, suggests that the defendant was downplaying his working hours.

> (f)     After considering the matter, what was more apparent to me was that the drop was principally due to the “Circuit Breaker” measures instituted by the Singapore government. That was the more dominant explaining his drop in takings. In line with the principles I highlighted above, it was clear, at least during the ‘Circuit Breaker’ period, that it was not financially sustainable for the defendant to carry on at the full value of the Maintenance Order.

> (g)     That having been said, the ‘Circuit Breaker’ period, could not, by itself, warrant the kind of _permanent_ reduction sought by the defendant. At the hearing, I asked Ms Shone that the issues being faced by the defendant was more temporary in nature, and whether any modification of the agreement should, if at all, factor this period. I was appreciative of Ms Shone’s candid submission that she had considered this, but she submitted that that was not the position which the plaintiff wished to take.

> (h)     At the hearing, I also sought Ms Shone’s update on the defendant’s endeavours in seeking an additional job _via_ e2i Singapore[^55]. Ms Shone informed me that he was still at the early stages of that process.

> (i)     Taken in its totality, I was inclined to find that the defendant’s drop in income in 2020 was driven more by the knock-on effects of COVID-19 than the change of the PHC’s policy itself. Even then, I would pause here that the defendant himself stated that he was receiving government relief during that time, as he was supplementing his income where he could. In any case, I was satisfied that that was a sufficiently material external circumstance that would warrant a _temporary downward adjustment_ of his maintenance obligations. As I had indicated to Ms Shone at the hearing through my questions, I was not inclined to accept that the present circumstances warranted a _permanent reduction_ of more than 70% of the defendant’s obligations towards the Children. I further considered a temporal adjustment to be more appropriate as it was in line with the defendant’s own evidence where he needed some assistance to “get back to better financial health” (see \[11(o)\] above). To my mind, this accords with the principles I highlighted above to give recognition to a parties’ financial circumstances, but to also ensure that the children’s circumstances are not significantly and adversely affected disproportionately. Put another way, I was not inclined to accept that the defendant’s overall temporary issues warranted the Children to be significantly deprived of the defendant’s contribution of maintenance in perpetuity.

> (j)     As for the duration of the adjustment, I pause here and not that by the time matter came for hearing, the ‘Circuit Breaker’ period had ended, and there was a stable implementation of ‘Phase 2’ of the relaxation measures instituted by the Singapore government. I would also add that not too long after filing his appeal, the Singapore government announced further relaxation of the safety measures in ‘Phase 3’. I was of the view that a period of 6 months was reasonable period for the defendant to obtain some relief from his obligations under the Maintenance Order. I also considered 6 months as being a sufficient runway for the defendant to improve his finances by, _inter alia_, being able to find employment through e2i Singapore, resolving his Johore Bahru accommodation and adjust his finances and expenses. For instance, by no longer staying in Johore, he would no longer be paying for his home rental and Touch & Go card (both expenses amounting to $560). I recognize that by staying in Singapore, some expenses may increase, but I was not of the view that there would be no overall savings at all. In any case, as Ms Shone highlighted at the hearing, the defendant’s return to Singapore coupled with his supplementary employment through e2i would allow an improvement of his finances (as well as savings).

#### The defendant’s other business ventures

25     For completeness, I touch on the plaintiff’s point of the two companies he was involved in. On the material before me, there was insufficient evidence to go either way to suggest whether the two business ventures were doing better than how the defendant paints it to be, or that they were truly not a going concern. As Ms Shone herself candidly submits, the defendant should not be penalised for being a bad businessman. That said, I would highlight that insofar as the defendant continues to be a director in one business, and started another in April 2019[^56], shows, to some extent, the defendant’s assessment of the continued viability of the business (and therefore his participation), and his level of resourcefulness to improve his financial circumstances, or at the very least, the resources he has to start a business in the first place.

### Appropriate and equitable adjustment to the Maintenance Order

26     Following from the above, the next matter to be determined was the appropriate adjustment of the Maintenance Order.

27     To recap, the Maintenance Order (i.e., $1300) provided a rough apportionment of $433 for each of the Children. As I mentioned earlier, on the defendant’s prayers, he was seeking a downward variation to $116 per child (i.e., $350).

28     Without referring to the Expenses Sheet, I was of the view that a contribution of $116 per child by the defendant would be manifestly inadequate sum. As I mentioned earlier, had the defendant sought for these documents during the affidavit stage of the proceedings, he would have realised that his prayers were manifestly unworkable. To the extent that the defendant was only able to address the Expenses Sheet in his written submissions and oral submissions at the hearing, there was nothing before me to suggest that the Children’s expenses were so unreasonable or manifestly inflated such that the defendants contribution of $116 per child was sustainable.

29     In fact, in his written submissions, the defendant himself highlights that any liability ought to be limited to a sum of $678 per month (or $226 per child)[^57].

30     At this juncture, I reproduce the portion of the Expenses Sheet[^58] relating to the Children. For completeness, the defendant’s submissions on these expenses[^59] are in italicised parenthesis beside each of the relevant figures.

31     After reviewing parties’ submissions, and adopting the principles enunciated by Ong J in _UEB v UEC_ \[2018\] SGHFC 5, I was of the view that the plaintiff’s figures were, to a lesser or greater extent, within reasonable norms. Whilst I accepted the defendant’s submission that some of the expenses may be moderated (i.e., school miscellaneous, milk, clothes and toiletries), it was clear to my mind that the defendant’s intended contribution of $116 per child was clearly unsustainable. Even if I were inclined to adopt the defendant’s figures wholly, the defendant is effectively saying that he should only contribute only 14% to 18% of each child’s expenses, with the defendant covering the balance. I was also not inclined to accept that his liability be capped to $678 per month (or $226 per child), as highlighted in his written submissions.

32     Related to this point, insofar as the defendant suggests that the plaintiff was able to cover for the balance _permanently_, I was not inclined to accept this argument both in principle as well as the evidence placed before me. I did not agree that as a matter of principle, the plaintiff ought to be shouldering this significantly unequal financial burden in perpetuity. Insofar as the defendant suggests that the plaintiff could afford this, I did not think that this was sustainable even after making some moderate adjustments on the defendant’s own expenses.

33     In my judgment, I was of the view that a more appropriate and equitable reduction of the defendant’s contribution would be $960 (i.e., $320 per child). This was approximately a 30% reduction of his obligation, such that the defendant would only be contributing approximately 40% of the children’s expenses _on the defendant’s calculated figures_ (and a lesser percentage on the plaintiff’s figures). In making these adjustments, it is not lost on this court that ultimately, the plaintiff would still have to bear the greater financial burden _on top of_ her non-financial burden as the care and control parent.

34     Before concluding, I note the concluding paragraph of the defendant’s written submissions:

> The Defendant submits that his application for a variation of maintenance downwards for the Children is not frivolous nor taken out because he is seeking to shirk from his financial responsibility as a father. It is submitted that the Defendant’s financial circumstances is dire, coupled with the constant need to attend Court for enforcement applications taken out by the Plaintiff, are pushing his mental boundaries. It is further submitted that unless and until the Defendant is able to climb out of his financial predicaments by being given a breathing space, pushing the Defendant beyond his financial abilities is simply going to be one vicious cycle for the Defendant, and throwing him into a labyrinth for a never ending cycle.

35     It suffices to make the following points. First, for as much as this court recognises the defendant’s predicament (hence my decision to temporarily vary the Maintenance Order), it would erroneous for the defendant to lament that the Maintenance Order is the predominant cause of his “financial predicament”, and conversely the sole solution to his problems. Second, it appears lost on the defendant that the Maintenance Order is ultimately for the sustenance of _his own biological children_. Third, and related to the second, is that while the defendant submits that he is not “seeking to shirk from his financial responsibilities”, his prayers (both in terms of quantum and the permanence) regrettably indicate the opposite. I would highlight here that even if I am wrong insofar as to the length of the variation, and perhaps the quantum, the extent (and permanence) of the reduction sought by the defendant was, to my mind, clearly unsustainable. As I have mentioned above, any downward variation of the Maintenance Order simply means that the plaintiff ultimately has to pick up the slack.

## Supplementary points raised by the plaintiff

36     Whilst not related to the defendant’s application, I found it apposite to briefly touch on two points raised in the plaintiff’s submissions.

37     First, the plaintiff sought for an order that the amounts under the Maintenance Order paid to the plaintiff automatically _via_ GIRO. This was principally on the basis that the plaintiff would not have to go through the inconvenience of chasing the defendant and having to make further enforcement applications. Whilst I empathise with the plaintiff, I was not inclined to make such an order. First, as a matter of procedure, this was the defendant’s application for a variation. Second, but more importantly, I did not see how changing the mode of payments would be more convenient for the plaintiff if the defendant did not have the funds at the relevant period of time. Third and insofar as the plaintiff was chasing the defendant through multiple enforcement applications, I note from the court records that the defendant has already resolved payment of the arrears towards the plaintiff _vide_ an order made in December 2020.

38     The second point I deal with is the plaintiff’s submissions on how the defendant had misrepresented his finances, and in doing so had managed to “hoodwink” the Legal Aid Bureau in granting him aid.[^60] At the outset, I would clarify that I make no finding as to whether or not (and if so to what extent) the the defendant had miscommunicated his position in order to obtain free legal representation. The only observation I would make is that, as I have made earlier, was that I was not satisfied, on the material before me at the hearing (which may or may not have been the level of information presented by the defendant to the Legal Aid Bureau), that the defendant’s financial circumstances warranted the prayers sought.

## Conclusion

39     For the above reasons, I ordered that the Maintenance Order be varied downwards to $960 per month for a period of 6 months from August 2020 to February 2021. From March 2021 onwards, the defendant’s contribution would revert back to the original sum of $1300 per month. I was not convinced that there be a reduction of such magnitude sought by the defendant, and for such reduction to be on a permanent basis.

40     On the issue of costs, I ordered that each party were to bear their own costs.

41     Lastly, I wish to thank Mr Selvaraj and Ms Shone for their assistance on the matter. I also wish to thank Ms Shone for accepting the brief as a Legal Aid matter.
