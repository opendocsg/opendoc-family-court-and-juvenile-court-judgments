Divorce – Unreasonable behaviour

29 November 2019

### District Judge Wendy Yu:

### Background Facts

1       The parties were married on xx October 2011 and they do not have any children from this marriage. However, the Wife has had four children from her previous marriage[^1]. On 18 May 2018, the husband (“the Husband”) commenced divorce proceedings based on the fact that the marriage had broken down irretrievably in that the wife (“the Wife”) had behaved in such a way that he could not reasonably be expected to live with her. The Wife then filed a Defence[^2] to contest the Husband’s case as she did not agree to the dissolution of the marriage.

2       The 1st hearing was fixed on 1 March 2019 but the hearing had to be re-fixed to 9 April 2019 as the Wife did not turn up for the hearing. She had contacted the Family Court in the morning of 1 March 2019 to inform the Court that her son was in hospital[^3]. In view of this, the Court decided to adjourn the matter to 9 April 2019 to give the Wife a chance to attend the hearing.

3       The hearing took place on 9 April 2019. The Wife was in person, while the Husband was represented by Mr C K Teo. After hearing the parties, I had dismissed the Husband’s application as I was of the view that the Husband had not proved, on a balance of probabilities that the Wife had behaved in a way that the Husband cannot reasonably to be expected to live with her.

4       The Husband, being dissatisfied with my decision, filed an Originating Summons on 16 May 2019 for leave to file his Notice of appeal out of time. Judicial Commissioner Tan Puay Boon granted him leave to do so on 23 August 2019. A Notice of Appeal was filed on 30 August 2019.

### The Alleged Unreasonable Behaviour

5       The Wife’s alleged unreasonable behaviour was particularised as follows[^4]:-

> (i)     The Wife is overly suspicious and frequently checks on the Plaintiff and his whereabouts. She gets angry when the Husband interacted with other women and went to the extent of deleting the Husband’s female contacts from his mobile phone. The Wife also made uncalled for remarks when the Husband dealt with female clients in the course of work[^5].

> (ii)     The Wife has no regard for the Husband’s feelings and lists herself as unmarried in her job applications and also tells people that she is unmarried. The Wife also passes rude comments about the Husband’s ex-wife during his father’s funeral causing much embarrassment[^6].

> (iii)     The Wife has no respect for the Husband. The Wife was not truthful with the Husband and instigated her children to tell lies to the Husband as well. On one occasion, the Wife’s son was involved in an accident while driving the Husband’s car. The Wife and the son lied to the Husband that the car was left unattended at the time of the accident[^7].

> (iv)     The Wife is indifferent to the Husband’s feelings and continued to behave in the manner described above, leading to conflict and unhappiness. In April 2017, the Husband left the matrimonial home and returned to Singapore to stay[^8].

6       The Husband had explained during cross-examination that he was “anxious to divorce” because he “could buy a house” for his mother[^9].

7       The Husband’s counsel had submitted that when the Wife had, in adopting a position of not wanting to end the marriage, portrayed herself to be someone who is oblivious or indifferent to the Husband’s feelings.[^10]

### The Wife’s Position

8       The Wife disagreed that the marriage had broken down irretrievably or that she had behaved in such a way that the Husband could not reasonably be expected to live with her. The Wife clarified that she did not wish to divorce[^11]. While the Wife had filed a form dated 6 August 2018 stating it was a Defence and Counterclaim, it was essentially a Defence. The Wife has also confirmed at the hearing that she was only proceeding with a Defence[^12]. The Wife stated that the statements made by the Husband were lies and that the Husband had made such claims against her because the Husband wanted to marry another woman[^13].

9       On the incident where the Wife’s son was involved in an accident, the Wife had stated that she did not inform the Husband about the accident in order to maintain harmony between the Husband and the Wife’s son[^14].

10     The Wife agreed that she had listed herself as unmarried in her job application once[^15].

11     The Wife acknowledged that the Husband had left the matrimonial home in April 2017 without informing her and kept posting photos with a woman on Facebook[^16], which the Husband explained that he has had “reasons for doing that[^17].” The Wife further added that after the Husband left home, he had kept sending a letter to the Wife asking for a divorce[^18]. The Wife had also added that the unhappiness between the parties was not caused by her[^19]. The Wife still wanted to salvage the marriage as the Wife’s children treated the Husband as their father[^20].

12     The Wife insisted that she did not delete the Husband’s female contacts from his handphone[^21].

13     The Wife added that she did not wish the end their relationship for the sake of the children[^22] and that the Husband is just “bewitched” by another woman but she will “tolerate” this for the sake of the children. The Wife reiterated that she was “prepared to wait” “until he changed”.[^23]

14     The Wife had also challenged the Husband’s evidence by asking the Husband to produce proof of his various allegations.

### The Law

15     It is trite law that section 95(1) of the Women’s Charter only provides one ground for divorce, and that is the irretrievable breakdown of the marriage. Section 95(3) states that the “court hearing any proceedings for divorce shall not hold the marriage to have broken down irretrievably unless the plaintiff satisfies the court of one or more of the following facts:

> (a)     that the defendant has committed adultery and the plaintiff finds it intolerable to live with the defendant;

> (b)     that the defendant has behaved in such a way that the plaintiff cannot reasonably be expected to live with the defendant;

> (c)     that the defendant has deserted the plaintiff for a continuous period of at least 2 years immediately preceding the filing of the writ;

> (d)     that the parties to the marriage have lived apart for a continuous period of at least 3 years immediately preceding the filing of the writ and the defendant consents to a judgment being granted;

> (e)     that the parties to the marriage have lived apart for a continuous period of at least 4 years immediately preceding the filing of the writ.”

16     In the present case, the Husband’s case is that the Wife has behaved in such a way that he cannot reasonably be expected to live with her. The Wife has not filed any counterclaim but only a Defence, and avers that the marriage has not broken down irretrievably. The onus is on the Husband to prove on a balance of probabilities that the Wife had behaved in a way that he cannot reasonably be expected to live with her.

17     In _Wong Siew Boey v. Lee Boon Fatt_ <span class="citation">\[1994\] SGHC 35</span>, the Court had opined that the question whether the petitioner finds it intolerable to live with the respondent must be answered subjectively; and in dealing with behaviour, the question is whether the petitioner can reasonably be expected to live with the respondent and it is for the Court to answer this, using an objective test and having regard to the personalities of individuals before it, however far these may be removed from some theoretical norm. The Court must also assess the impact of the respondent’s conduct and the particular petitioner in the light of the whole history of the marriage and their relationship, and must look at behaviour by taking into account the _cumulative_ effect of behaviour, in relation to all the relevant circumstances.

18     The question whether the Wife has behaved in such a way that it was unreasonable to expect the Husband to live with her is essentially a finding of fact. The general test, as stated by KS Rajah JC (as he then was), was: “_Would any right-thinking person come to the conclusion that this husband has behaved in such a way that this wife cannot reasonably be expected to live with him, taking into account the whole of the circumstances and the characters and personalities of the parties?”_

19     The principles in _Wong Siew Boey_ have also been applied in _Castello Ana Paula Costa Fusillier v. Lobo Carlos Manuel Rosado_ \[2003\] 4 SLR (R) 331 and _Teo Hoon Ping v. Tan Lay Ying_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGHC 244</span>.

## Applying the Law to Facts of this Case

## SOP Paragraph 1(b)- Wife being overly suspicious and checks on Husband, deleting his contacts from his mobile phone and makes remarks when Husband deals with female clients.

20     The Wife has denied this has happened. There was no evidence produced by the Husband to prove this allegation other than his bare statement. I was of the view that there was insufficient evidence to prove that this had occurred.

## SOP Paragraph 1(c)- Wife having no regard for Husband’s feelings – listing herself as unmarried in job application and passed rude comments about the Husband’s ex-wife during the Husband’s Father’s funeral.

21     While the Wife conceded that she had declared herself as unmarried in a job application, she stated that it was a one-off incident. I had accepted that this incident had taken place but took the view that this incident would not amount to “unreasonable behaviour” justifying a divorce.

22     The incident cited of the Wife’s behaviour during the Husband’s father’s funeral should not be considered as it did not happen in the course of the marriage (the Funeral took place sometime in July 2010[^24], while the marriage commenced 19 October 2011). While the Husband stated that the Wife was not happy about having a cordial relationship with his ex-wife, there was not sufficient evidence with regard to this. There was no evidence produced by the Husband to prove the allegation that the Wife has no regard for his feelings other than his bare assertions. While the Husband’s counsel had said that the Wife, in insisting to salvage the marriage, displayed behaviour that the Wife had no regard for his feelings, it would not be fair to say that an attempt to salvage a marriage is “unreasonable behaviour” justifying a divorce.

## SOP Paragraph 1(d)- Wife having no respect for Husband, and instigated her children to tell lies to the Husband as well, including lying about an accident involving the Husband’s car.

23     There was also insufficient evidence to the Husband’s allegations that the Wife had no respect for him, save for his bare statement. I took the view that there was insufficient evidence to prove that this had occurred. On the incident where there was an accident, the Wife had explained that it did not involve the Husband’s car[^25] and that she was trying to manage the relationship with the Husband and her son. Even if the incident occurred, a single incident as such would not amount to “unreasonable behaviour” justifying a divorce.

## SOP Paragraph 1(e)- Wife being indifferent to the Husband’s feelings and continued to behave in the manner described in SOP, leading to conflict and unhappiness.

24     There was once again, no evidence produced by the Husband to prove this allegation other than his bare statement. There was insufficient evidence to prove that this had occurred.

25     The Husband’s counsel conceded that there was a lack of evidence and that “the (Husband)….was very candid, he has no proof, in fact because he did not anticipate”.[^26]

26     By way of information, the Husband’s AEIC did not contain sufficient particulars of the incidents alleged by him to support his allegation of unreasonable behaviour. I am unable to conclude that the Wife has behaved in such a way that the Husband cannot be reasonably to live with her even as the Court assesses the behaviour of the Wife by taking into account the _cumulative_ effect of her behaviour, in relation to all the relevant circumstances.

27     It is not an easy task to decide if a marriage should be dissolved under the law, especially where one party maintains that the marriage has not broken down irretrievably contrary to the other party’s claims. It was clear to me that the Husband wished to leave the marriage for reasons that only the Husband is aware of. The Husband is entitled to his views but in order to grant a divorce on the basis of unreasonable behaviour on the part of the Wife, I have to be satisfied that the Wife had indeed acted unreasonably, and as explained above, there was insufficient basis for me to make such a finding, especially when the contents in the SOP were simply not made out factually.

28     The Husband had failed to discharge his burden of proof. I have therefore dismissed the application.
