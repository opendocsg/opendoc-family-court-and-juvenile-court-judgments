Family law – Custody, Care and Control – Division of Matrimonial Assets – Maintenance

2 March 2020 - Judgement reserved.

### District Judge Chia Wee Kiat:

## Introduction

1       The Plaintiff shall be referred to as the “Wife” and the Defendant shall be referred to as the “Husband”. The parties were married on 11 December 2008[^1] and an interim Judgement of Divorce (“IJ”) was granted on 16 May 2018 based on the Husband’s counterclaim[^2] that the marriage has broken down irretrievably by reason of the Wife’s behaviour.[^3] The length of the marriage up to the time of IJ was close to 10 years.

2       The Husband was introduced to the Wife in June 2006 as a manufacturer of skin care products when the Wife was working at a beauty salon.[^4] The Wife has a child \[A\] (name redacted) from her previous marriage. The Wife divorced her ex-husband in 2007.[^5] The Husband formally adopted A on 14 October 2011[^6] when A was 7 years old.[^7] A turns 16 this year.

3       The Husband has two children from his first marriage. Both are now above 21 years old.[^8]

4       The Husband is the Chief Executive Officer of \[B\] Pte Ltd,[^9] a company he started on 12 July 1994, 14 years before the parties were married.[^10] The Wife says she is currently unemployed and was previously an employee of B Pte Ltd.[^11] This is disputed by the Husband who says she did not actually carry out any work for B Pte Ltd[^12] but instead has a business of her own trading in luxury bags.[^13]

5       The Husband says the breakdown of the marriage was due to various reasons, including the Wife’s indulgent lifestyle, her neglect of the family and her infidelity.[^14] The Wife says it was the unreasonable behaviour of the Husband that compelled her to flee the matrimonial home in February 2017.[^15]

6       The Wife left the matrimonial home on 1 February 2017 without A and has not returned to reside since.[^16] The Wife says she did not bring A along as she wanted to rent a proper home for A first.[^17]

7       The Husband says he did not know where the Wife had moved to but later learned that the Wife had been staying at an apartment in The Tembusu (“the Tembusu property”).[^18] According to the Husband, the Tembusu property was an apartment which the wife bought in 2013 during the marriage but kept it a secret from him.[^19] The Husband says the Wife was having an extra-marital relationship with \[C\] who had a share in the Tembusu property. It is not disputed that C’s share was subsequently bought over by the Wife.[^20] The Wife says she became close to C because of torments inflicted by the Husband.[^21]

8       C died an unnatural death in late 2015. The Husband says C had jumped out of a moving car which the Wife was driving after a heated argument, [^22] but the Wife says C had opened the door because he was very drunk and fell out of the car and died.[^23]

9       After his death, C’s widow \[D\] approached the Husband at his office to tell him about C’s affair with the Wife.[^24] D told the Husband she only discovered the full extent of C’s infidelity because of police investigations into his death.[^25]

10     The Husband says that throughout 2016, he tried to keep the peace for A’s sake but the Wife’s extra-marital affair with C had left him deeply scarred and there was tension in the relationship.[^26] The Wife left the matrimonial home on 1 February 2017 after they had a major disagreement during Chinese New Year.[^27]

11     On 25 September 2017[^28], A left the Husband to live with the Wife.[^29] The Husband says A did not tell him about her leaving until she had physically left the home. A then sent a message on 28 September 2017 to the Husband as follows:[^30]

> Daddy this week im staying with mummy because of my exams but i want you to know no matter what happens You will always be my daddy and i will always be your daughter.

> …

> In the end i will still see you

> It may not be everyday or every week but i still love you

12     This heart-warming message and several other contemporaneous exchanges between A and the Husband reveal that there was a loving and endearing parent-child relationship between them even though A was from the Wife’s previous marriage.[^31]

13     On 27 September 2017, the Wife commenced divorce proceedings claiming that the Husband had behaved in such a way that she could not reasonably be expected to live with him. [^32] The Husband says it was too coincidental that the Wife filed for a divorce soon after inviting A to live with her and that the Wife had invited A to live with her only to paint herself in a better light in these proceedings.[^33] The Husband filed a defence and counterclaim.[^34]

14     On 2 January 2018, the Wife filed FC/SUM 12/2018 (“SUM 12”) to claim $15,000 per month as interim maintenance for herself and A. On 19 April 2018, the learned District Judge Goh Zhuo Neng dismissed the Wife’s claim for interim maintenance for herself and ordered the Husband to pay maintenance for A in the sum of $1,784.71 per month, consisting of $720 paid to the Wife and $1,064.71 paid directly to third parties.[^35] In dismissing her claim for maintenance, the court noted as follows:[^36]

> She is clearly able to provide for herself. In my view, she has considerable income. This is the inference I have drawn from the non-disclosure of complete bank statements and credit card statements and the transactions in the Table 1 provided to you.

15     The divorce came up for hearing on 16 May 2019 before the learned District Judge Daniel Koh. The Wife’s claim was dismissed and IJ was granted on the basis of the Husband’s counterclaim based on the Wife’s behaviour.[^37] The Wife says this was pursuant to a mediated settlement.[^38] The following ancillary matters were adjourned to be heard in chambers:[^39]

> (a)     Custody, care and control of and access to A;

> (b)     Division of matrimonial assets;

> (c)     Maintenance for A;

> (d)     Maintenance for the Wife;

> (e)     Costs.

16     The ancillary matters (“AM”) were heard before me on 31 October 2019. The parties are agreed that there will be no maintenance for the Wife while the current maintenance for A will continue.[^40] The parties are also agreed that the Wife will have care and control of A with liberal access to the Husband[^41].

17     Whilst the parties have agreed on most of the issues concerning A, the Wife sees “no reason for joint custody”.[^42] The Wife wants sole custody while the Husband wants joint custody.[^43] The Wife exhibited a letter dated 6 August 2018 from A to the Husband’s lawyers that states as follows:[^44]

>   
| 

To: Michelle Woodworth

RHTLaw Taylor Wessing LLP

 | 

cc: Vincent Yeoh,

Malkin & Maxwell LLP

 |

  
  

> From: \[A\]

> Subject: Divorce of \[Name of Wife\] and \[Name of Father\]

> I am told that my father wants to have joint custody. However, I do not want it, although I am grateful for his generosity. Previously when I used to live with him, he was rarely at home since he was mostly back to back business trips or always at his office. Even if he sent me to school in the morning or during dinner, he would not talk to me much.

> I never really properly connected to him one-to-one as well. Unlike my relationship with my mother, I was very cautious of what I tell when we do talk, because I was mostly afraid of what his reaction would be, especially if it was negative.

> Even during dinner, he was always on his phone, texting or calling and due to the quiet and awkward atmosphere, it caused my mother and I to use our phones while eating as well. Therefore we also did not talk to each other. The only person who I have proper conversation with is my mother. My mother and I connect easily and understand each other, making our very conversation enjoyable.

> My mother also cooks most of our meals when she was still staying with us, although we have a helper at home. She would also serve us during our meals, making sure we had started eating before she does. She would spend a lot of time cooking food and would always make sure to cook or bake something special for our birthday. For example, during daddy’s birthday, mummy cooked a wide variety of dishes and make a delicious chocolate cake for him.

> When I had already moved out, my father did not contact me much and did not take the effort to invite me out to meet him or talk to him.

> To sum up, I would much rather stay with my mother than my father. Please show this letter to the judge and tell the judge not to give joint custody to my father of me.

> My phone number is \[xxx\]. You can call me if you want or need to talk to me.

> \[A\]

> 6/8/18

18     Whilst the letter is addressed to the lawyers for the Husband, there is a request by A that the letter be shown “to the judge and tell the judge not to give joint custody to my father of me”. Taken at face value, the contents of the letter point to a discernible shift in the attitude of the child towards the Husband after she left home to live with the Wife. The dismissive tone towards the Husband stands in stark contrast to the endearing messages she had previously sent him. The letter conveys a wholesome picture of the Wife whilst painting the Husband in less favourable light in their respective contributions to the family. The overall picture that emerged suggests that the child has been triangulated into the conflicts of the parents.

19     After the hearing on 31 October 2019, I reserved my decision to give further consideration to the parties’ submissions. I also directed the parties to file a Joint Summary in view of the numerous assets listed for division. The Annex to the Plaintiff’s Submissions listed a total of 192 assets under the Wife’s sole name and 42 assets under the Husband’s sole name. In addition, the Annex also listed a number of joint assets and liabilities. In a case such as the present involving multiple assets, a Joint Summary would be helpful to identify the issues in dispute so that the court’s time and resources are not wasted in sieving through matters that are inconsequential or not disputed. The Joint Summary was duly filed on 2 December 2019 and I thank counsel for their assistance.

20     At the hearing, the parties confirmed that they have no objections for the decision of the court to be rendered in writing. This is permissible under Rule 670 of the Family Justice Rules.

21     Have carefully considered the submissions of the parties and the evidence, I now set out my decision and the reasons.

## Custody, care and control and access

22     I begin with the Joint Summary since this sets out the parties’ latest positions. According to the Joint Summary, the parties agree that the Wife shall have care and control of the child. The Wife proposes liberal access to the child by prior appointment with the Wife whilst the Husband proposes liberal access to the child and that the child be at liberty to contact the Husband as and when she wishes. The main area of dispute relates to the issue of custody - the Wife seeks sole custody whilst the Husband seeks joint custody. [^45]

23     The Wife says there is “no reason” for joint custody. She says that the Husband has no interest whatsoever in A and has to date not bothered to meet A or even initiate a telephone call to her since she left him in 2017.[^46]

24     The Husband points out that although A was the Wife’s daughter from her previous marriage, the Husband has treated A as his very own daughter and formalised the father-daughter relationship by an Adoption Order dated 14 October 2011.[^47]

25     Over the years, the Husband frequently sent A to and from school, tuition classes and outings with her friends. The Husband was also concerned about A’s studies, her interests and the boy-girl relationships she has.[^48] The Husband and A shared a close relationship[^49] and even though A has left home, the Husband has emphasised to A that he is always there for her and will welcome her back if she wants to come.[^50] The Husband continued to keep in touch with A through WhatsApp conversations from time to time after A moved out.[^51] One such message from the Husband to A reads:[^52]

![]([2020] SGFC 0027_Image/[2020] SGFC 0027_image1.png)

26     The Husband is concerned that the Wife has involved A in the proceedings and there is a possibility that A has been misinformed about the proceedings and told only the Wife’s side of the story, which would explain the adversarial stance A appears to take in her letter and the harsh allegations she makes about the father in order to further her mother’s case.[^53]

27     The principles of law on custody are well settled. In the usual case, a child’s welfare is best promoted by making either no custody order or a joint custody order. As explained by the Court of Appeal in _CX v CY (minor: custody and access)_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 3 SLR(R) 690</span> (“_CX_”) (at \[27\]), both orders uphold the principle of joint parental responsibility and also signal to the child that both parents will continue to be involved in the child’s life (see also _AZZ v BAA_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 44</span> (“_AZZ_”)(at \[35\]).

28     The Court of Appeal explained further (at \[28\]) as follows:

> More significantly, we feel that the making of joint or no custody orders reminds the parents that the law expects both of them to co-operate to promote the child’s best interest. With the grant of joint or no custody orders, the likelihood of the non-custodial parents being excluded from the child’s life is much reduced. It also encourages the parent who does not reside with the child to continue to play his or her role in joint parenthood.

29     The Court of Appeal held (at \[24\]) that an order for one parent to have sole custody is exceptional:

> We believe that, generally, joint or no custody orders should be made, with sole custody orders being an exception to the rule.

30     As regards the circumstances where a sole custody order is appropriate, the Court of Appeal said (at \[38\]) as follows:

> We agree with Assoc Prof Debbie Ong that the exceptional circumstances where sole custody orders are made may be one where one parent physically, sexually or emotionally abuses the child (see Debbie Ong, “Making No Custody Order” (\[19\] _supra_) at p 586), or where the relationship of the parties is such that co-operation is impossible even after the avenues of mediation and counselling have been explored, and the lack of co-operation is harmful to the child (see Debbie Ong, “Parents and Custody Orders” (\[27\] _supra_) at p 222-223).

31     In the present case, none of the reasons provided by the Wife falls within any of these exceptional circumstances. Instead, the reasons provided by the Wife reveal a readiness on her part to exclude the Husband from participating in the long-term and significant decisions concerning A’s welfare and upbringing on the tenuous grounds. It is troubling that the child has been enmeshed in the proceedings to such an extent as to reject the father.

32     Custody is fundamentally about decision-making (see _AZZ_ at \[52\]) and not about which parent the child gets to stay with (see _CX_ at \[31\]). The Husband has indicated in his first Affidavit of Assets and Means (“DAOM”) filed on 13 July 2019 that care and control is to be given to the Wife.[^54] Hence, it is clear that there is no dispute that the child will be staying with the Wife. A’s letter dated 6 August 2018 to say that “I would much rather stay with mother than my father” is unnecessary.

33     In my judgment, a joint custody order is essential to remind the Wife that “\[a\]n important aspect of parental responsibility is facilitating the child’s relationship with the other parent”: _VDZ v VEA_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHCF 2</span> (at \[46\]). The Wife needs to understand that the Husband, as the adoptive father, bears every aspect of parental responsibility and authority over A: see s 7 of the Adoption of Children Act (Cap 4, 2012 Rev Ed). She needs to be reminded that the Husband has an equal say in significant matters concerning the child’s upbringing (see _CX_ at \[20\]).

34     As regards access, I am satisfied that A is mature and independent enough to make her own decisions about communicating with the Husband. There is no reason why the Husband and A should not be at liberty to contact each other directly as they already do. I find it unnecessary to regulate by court order that the access is to be carried out “by prior appointment”.

35     For the above reasons, my orders are as follows:

> (a)     The parties shall have joint custody of A.

> (b)     The Wife shall have care and control of A.

> (c)     The Husband shall have liberal access to A. The Husband shall be at liberty to contact A directly and A shall be at liberty to contact the Husband directly as and when she wishes to do so.

## Division of matrimonial assets

## Joint Assets

36     The parties agree that the following assets held in joint names are matrimonial assets:

37     Of the two joint assets, only the valuation of the Sirat Road matrimonial home is disputed.[^55] Parties have obtained two valuations of the matrimonial home as follows:[^56]

> (a)     Wife’s valuation: $2,650,000 (as at 25 June 2018).

> (b)     Husband’s valuation: $2,350,000 (as at 29 June 2018).

38     The Husband submits that his value of $2,350,000 should be used as the valuation is later in time.[^57] The valuation was obtained from TEHO Property Consultants Pte Ltd (“TEHO”) which was the same valuer who assessed the properties held by B Pte Ltd. The Husband says it will be consistent to use the same valuer to assess the value of the matrimonial home.[^58] The Wife asserts that the average value should be used[^59] as it a fair and rational resolution.[^60]

39     As the learned author in _N Khublall, Compulsory Land Acquisition Singapore and Malaysia (Second Edition)_ said at page 162:

> Valuation is not a precise science; valuers resort to simple mathematics only as an aid to valuation. However overwhelming are the sales evidence and other relevant data at the disposal of a valuer, he nevertheless has to exercise a value judgment in the light of his training and professional experience as to what in his considered opinion the value of a property should be. Different valuers tend to give different figures within a range for the same property.

40     In the present case, no question has been raised by either party with regard to the reliability of the valuation reports. The principle contention by the Husband is that the assets should be valued as close to the AM hearing date as possible.[^61]

41     While the valuation closest to the AM date is generally preferred (see _UZO v UZP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHCF 27</span> (at \[14\]), this principle must be applied sensibly and according to the facts of the case. In the present case, the valuation report by the Wife’s valuers Savills Valuation & Professional Services (S) Pte Ltd (“Savills”) has a validity period of three months[^62] whilst TEHO’s valuation provides for a validity of a “reasonable period”[^63].

42     As the gap between the two valuations is only four days apart and Savills’ valuation was valid at the time of TEHO’s valuation, there is no principled reason for the court to prefer the later valuation. In fact, both valuations would have been outdated by the time of the AM hearing on 31 October 2019 but they are nonetheless being relied upon because there is no other evidence on the market value of the property.

43     In the circumstances, I find it fair and reasonable to adopt the average which is $2,500,000.[^64] In taking this approach, I am aware that there is at least one recent authority that adopted the average of two valuations: see _TQU v TQT_ \[2020\] SGCA 08 (“_TQU_”) (at \[59\]). As the agreed outstanding loan is $654,374.91,[^65] the net value of the matrimonial home is $1,845,625.09 ($2,500,000 - $654,374.91).

44     The total net value of the joint assets is therefore $1,863,465.32 ($17,840.23 + $1,845,625.09).

**Wife’s Assets**

_Agreed Matrimonial Assets_

45     From the Joint Summary, there are 186 assets under the Wife’s sole name which are not disputed to be matrimonial assets.[^66] Out of these, 123 items (S/N 64.1 to 64.123) are second-hand luxury items left in the matrimonial home. These 186 assets are tabulated below:

![]([2020] SGFC 0027_Image/[2020] SGFC 0027_image8.png)

46     While the above assets are not disputed to be matrimonial assets, there are disputes pertaining to the values of some of the assets. These are dealt with below.

##### S/N 1 - The Tembusu Property

47     The Tembusu property is a property held in the Wife’s sole name but beneficially held in part by the Wife’s mother. The beneficial ownership in the Tembusu property was the subject of a High Court action in HC/OS1013/2018 (“OS 1013”) filed by the Wife.[^67] In OS 1013, the High Court declared that the Wife’s mother has a beneficial interest in the Tembusu property in the proportion of 60.91%.

48     It is not disputed that the Wife has a 39.09% share in the Tembusu property and there is an outstanding Maybank housing loan.[^68] The Wife’s valuer estimates the market value of the Tembusu property at $850,000 (as at 25 June 2018) whilst the Husband’s valuer’s estimate is $830,000 (as at 6 July 2018). The Husband submits that the valuation closer to the AM hearing date should be used.[^69] Taking the market value at $830,000, the Husband submits that 39.09% of the equity of the Tembusu property would be about $219,682.32 calculated as follows:[^70]

> (a)     Estimated market value (6 July 2018): $830,000

> Less

> (b)     Outstanding loan (1 June 2018) : $284,274.97

> Plus

> Taking into account mortgage from July 2018 to October 2019 (16 months) at $1,016.63 per month (amount of most recent instalment paid on 1 June 2018 as disclosed by the Wife) : $16,266.08

> (c)     Net market value: $561,991.11.

> (d)     The Wife’s share = 39.09% of $561,991.11 = $219,682.32.

49     The Wife contends that the Husband’s valuation of the Tembusu property treats the Maybank loan as proportionately borne by the Wife and her mother. The Wife submits that this is wrong for two reasons. First, the High Court arrived at 60.91% (to the mother) and 39.09% (to the Wife) because the mother had actually already paid out cash equivalent to 60.91% of the purchase cost of the Tembusu property while the Wife contributed equivalent to 39.09% and this contribution of the Wife came from the Maybank loan and the takeover of C’s share. If the mother were to be also liable for the Maybank loan then her share of the property would have been far greater than 60.91%. Second, Maybank granted the loan to the Wife alone and only the Wife as the sole borrower is liable to Maybank. Therefore, the Maybank loan is wholly borne by the Wife.[^71]

50     As regards the market value of the Tembusu property, the Wife submits that the fair and rational resolution is to adopt the average which is $840,000.[^72] Hence, the Wife’s computation is as follows:[^73]

> (a)     Market value of the Tembusu property: $840,000

> (b)     Gross value of Wife’s interest = $328,356 ($840,000 x 39.09%)

> Less

> (c)     Outstanding loan of $284,274.97

> (d)     Net value of Wife’s interest = $44,081.03 ($328,356 -

> $284,274.97).

51     Arising from the above, there are three issues for determination:

> (a)     The market value of the Tembusu property;

> (b)     The quantum of the outstanding loan; and

> (c)     How the outstanding loan is to be treated for the purpose of calculating the net value of the Wife’s share in the Tembusu property.

52     On the first issue, I have in the context of the valuation of the matrimonial home explained why it is fair and reasonable to adopt the average value of the two valuations.[^74] Those reasons apply similarly to the Tembusu property. A fair and reasonable approach would be to take the average which is $840,000.

53     As noted in _UYP v UYQ_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHCF 16</span> (“_UYP_”) (at \[4\]):

> As a general position, the operative date for the identification of MAs is the date of the IJ, and all MAs should be valued at the date of the ancillary matters (“AM”) hearing. Balances in the parties’ bank and Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) accounts are to be taken at the date of the IJ, as the MAs are the moneys and not the bank and CPF accounts themselves.

54     The valuations by Savills and TEHO would have been outdated by the time of the AM hearing on 31 October 2019. However, as these are the only evidence before the court on the market value of the Tembusu property, I shall adopt the average value of $840,000 as the market value for the purpose of determining the net value of the Wife’s share in the property at the time of the AM hearing.

55     Turning to the second issue, the quantum of the outstanding loan should similarly be determined at the time of the AM hearing. In this regard, the Wife’s outstanding loan figure of $284,274.97 is based on her Maybank statement of account dated 21 June 2018[^75]. According to the Husband, the Wife has refused to update this figure despite the Husband’s request by letter on 17 October 2019.[^76] The statement of account exhibited by the Wife shows that the monthly instalment payment was $1016.63 as at 1 June 2018.[^77] On this basis, the Husband computed that from July 2018 to October 2019 (16 months), the Wife would have paid down the housing loan by another $16,266.08 by the time of the AM hearing.

56     The Wife says that this is pure speculation and unsubstantiated by evidence.[^78] However, the onus is on the Wife to produce evidence of the outstanding housing loan as at the date of the AM hearing which she could have done by getting an updated statement of account from Maybank. Since she did not do so and there is no evidence to suggest that she had defaulted in the payment, it is only reasonable to assume that she had been making the monthly instalment payment towards the housing loan from July 2018 to October 2019. Accordingly, I adopt the sum of $268,008.89 ($284,274.97-$16,266.08)[^79] as the outstanding housing loan as at the date of the AM hearing.

57     Turning to the third issue, the Husband contends that the Order of Court dated 30 May 2019 states unequivocally that the Wife holds 60.91% of the property on trust for her mother and that if the court had intended to declare that the outstanding loan is the Wife’s sole responsibility, the declared proportion of the parties’ beneficial ownership would be completely different.[^80]

58     The Order of Court dated 30 May 2019 declared that the Wife’s mother has a beneficial interest in the Tembusu property in the proportion of 60.91% and that the Wife “holds 60.91% of the Property on trust” for the mother.[^81]

59     The Wife explains as follows:[^82]

> At the High Court proceedings, my mother’s case was that she had already paid out cash of $491,200 (amounting to 60.91% of the total investment) towards the purchase of the Tembusu property, and therefore she should own a beneficial interest of 60.91% in the Tembusu property (see her affidavit and submissions exhibited at pages 23-51). The High Court agreed with her and granted her 60.91% beneficial interest in the Tembusu property. The decision was as such if and only if the High Court also, by implication, found that I contributed the whole of the balance 39.09% and that my contribution came from the Maybank loan (and thus I was solely liable for the whole of it.

60     The Tembusu property was bought on 13 August 2013 for $738,000. Including stamp duty of $68,400, the total investment was $806,400.[^83] The total amount paid by the Wife’s mother was $491,200. This corresponds to 60.91% of the total investment of $806,400.

61     Hence it is clear that the High Court’s determination of the 60.91% beneficial interest of the mother is based on the mother’s contribution of $491,200 against the total investment of $806,400. As the Wife is the only other person with a beneficial interest in the property (the Wife had bought over C’s share[^84]), it must follow that her beneficial interest in and hence her contribution to the property is in the proportion of 39.09%.

62     It is not disputed that the Wife had obtained a Maybank housing loan to fund her contribution towards the total investment of $806,400. This is a liability undertaken by the Wife alone. To determine the net value of the Wife’s share in the Tembusu property as at the date of the AM hearing, it would be incorrect to deduct the outstanding loan from the market value. To do so would mean that the mother is equally liable for the outstanding loan, which is not the case. Furthermore, the mother’s beneficial interest of 60.91% as determined by the High Court did not include any contribution from the Maybank housing loan. The contribution from the Maybank housing loan towards the payment of the investment sum was neither apportioned nor attributed to the mother in any way.

63     In support of the proposition that the Wife’s share in the Tembusu property must be taken as 39.09% of the equity in the Tembusu property,[^85] the Husband refers to _TBZ v TCA_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHCF 18</span> (“_TBZ_”) where the court held (at \[17\]) as follows: [^86]

> … a matrimonial asset at any given point of time is the equity of the parties in that asset. This equity is, in turn, the difference between the value that the parties will be able to realise from the asset (the market value) and the outstanding liabilities owed by the parties on the asset at the relevant time.

64     In the present case however, the outstanding Maybank housing loan in is not “owed by the parties” but only by the Wife. Since the matrimonial asset in question is the wife’s share in the Tembusu property, her equity is determined by the difference in the value that she will be able to realise from the market value of the Tembusu property in proportion to her beneficial interest of 39.09% and the outstanding housing loan owed by her as at the date of the AM hearing.

65     In summary, I determine the net value of the Wife’s 39.09% beneficial interest in the Tembusu property to be $60,347.11 calculated as follows:

> (a)     Market value of the Tembusu property: $840,000

> (b)     Gross value of Wife’s interest = $328,356 ($840,000 x 39.09%)

> Less

> (c)     Outstanding loan of $268,008.89 ($284,274.97- $16,266.08)

> (d)     Net value of Wife’s interest = $60,347.11 ($328,356 –

> $268,008.89).

##### S/N 2 – Land Rover Range Rover Evoque (Kahn Design)

66     The Wife’s car was purchased on 26 November 2012 at a sum of $280,000 on hire purchase.[^87] The car was registered on 21 November 2012.[^88] The Wife estimates the value of the car as at 9 July 2018 at $85,000.[^89] The amount outstanding on the hire purchase agreement as at 28 May 2018 is $128,518.[^90] Hence, according to the Wife, the car has a negative net value of ($43,518).[^91]

67     The Husband’s position is that the current market value of the car should be $140,000 being $90,000 for a car of similar model plus a premium of $50,000 for the unique Kahn Design.[^92] The Husband says that the Wife’s car has been customised and uniquely designed by a British automotive fashion house. It is an exclusive design that was specially imported from the UK and there are only two units in Asia. The additional price of $50,000 is therefore a conservative estimate.[^93]

68     The Husband points out that the outstanding loan provided by the Wife has not been updated since more than 15 months ago. As the Wife has refused to provide the information, the Husband submits that the outstanding loan should be not more than $90,928 by now on the assumption that the Wife continued to pay the hire purchase instalment of $2,506 per month from July 2018 to September 2019.[^94] Therefore, the Husband contends that the net value of the Wife’s car would be $49,072.00 ($140,000 - $90,928).

69     The Wife relies on an advertisement on SGcarmart for a car of a similar make with an asking price of $87,888. This was an older car registered on 9 March 2012.[^95] The Husband also relies on an advertisement on SGcarmart where the asking price was $90,000.[^96] This car was registered on 30 November 2012 which was closer to the registration date of the Wife’s car, i.e. 21 November 2012.[^97] Based on the available evidence before the court, I find the comparable provided by the Husband to be a better comparable. Moreover, the comparable is more recent (i.e. 20 July 2019)[^98], and is significantly closer to the AM hearing date than the Wife’s comparable which dates back to 9 July 2018[^99].

70     Turning next to the additional premium of $50,000 for the Kahn Design, there is no evidence to show if the estimate provided by the Husband is conservative. The evidential burden of proof lies on a party asserting a proposition or refuting other evidence brought into play: see _UJF v UJG_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHCF 1</span> (“_UJF_”) at \[55\]. In my judgment, the Husband has failed to discharge the evidential burden of proving his assertion. Whilst it is reasonable to assume that a second-hand car with a unique Kahn Design may possibly fetch a higher price, there is no reason to assume that the additional premium would amount to a hefty sum of $50,000. Any assertion in this regard must be substantiated by clear evidence.

71     Finally, as the value of the car is to be assessed at the date of the AM hearing, I adopt the sum of $90,928 as the outstanding loan. Since the Wife did not provide an updated figure on the outstanding loan, I find the calculation by the Husband - which is based on the hire purchase monthly instalment - to be reasonable. Taking the market value at $90,000 and the outstanding loan at $90,928, the car would have a negative net value of ($928). Given that some consideration may be given to the unique Kahn Design and taking a broad-brush approach, I ascribe a final net value of $0 to the car.

##### S/N 3 to 12 - Wife’s insurance policies

72     The Wife has 10 insurance policies (S/N 3 to 12). The Husband submits that the Wife’s policies are valued at $56,511.53 based on the latest figures as at various dates in 2018. These values would have increased over the year but the Wife has not provided the updated information. The Husband asks that the court take into account the likely increase in the value of the Wife’s policies since one year ago. [^100]

73     Based on the figures provided by the Wife in the Joint Summary, the total value of the Wife’s policies is $56,011.22. The difference between her total value ($56,011.22) and that of the husband ($56,511.53) is not substantial; the difference of about $500 is attributable to minor differences in the values of three policies (S/N 5, 7 & 9) - the Husband adopts the gross surrender value whilst the Wife adopts the guaranteed surrender value.[^101]

74     In my judgment, the guaranteed surrender value should be taken as the non-guaranteed component is speculative in nature. Accordingly, I adopt the figure of $56,011.22 as the total value of the Wife’s policies. While I accept the Husband’s submission that this total value would have increased by the time of the AM hearing, I do not think the increase would be so significant as to affect the overall division in any material way.

##### S/N 13 to 20 – Wife’s bank balances

75     There are eight bank accounts in the Wife’s name (S/N 13 to 20). The parties agree that the POSB Kids Trust account (S/N 16), which has a balance of $11,243.60, should be excluded from division as the funds belong to A.[^102]

76     Of the seven other bank accounts, the values of three are disputed on the basis of the operative date (S/N 14, 15 & 19). The Wife’s position is that values nearest to the AM hearing should be the values taken into the pool of matrimonial assets[^103] whilst the Husband’s position is that the balances in the bank accounts should be calculated as close as possible to the IJ date.[^104]

77     As a matter of law, the position contended by the Husband is clearly the correct position: see _UYP v UYQ_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHCF 16</span> (at \[4\]); _UZO v UZP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHCF 27</span> (at \[11\]); _UZM v UZN_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHCF 26</span> (at \[9\]). Hence, for these three bank accounts, the values to be adopted are respectively $251.21 (S/N 14), $2,785.09 (S/N 15) and $67.62 (S/N 19).

78     Finally, there is one other bank account where the value is disputed. This is the Maybank Time Deposit Account No.~4486 (S/N 20). From the Time Deposit Advice dated 21 June 2018 exhibited in the Wife’s Affidavit of Assets and Means,[^105] the effective date of this account was 6 December 2016 and the term is 24 months. The principal sum is $134,000 and the interest on the date of maturity (6 December 2018) is $2,680.

79     According to the Wife, she had borrowed $50,000 from her aunt \[H\] to make up $134,000 required by Maybank as cash security in order to obtain the loan for the purchase of the Tembusu property.[^106] In support of her claim, she exhibited a cheque from H dated 5 December 2016 drawn in her favour for $50,000.[^107]

80     The Husband asserts that the Wife’s claim that the $50,000 is meant to be repaid to her aunt is unsubstantiated. The $134,000 deposited would have accrued interest which should be part of the asset pool.[^108]

81     In my judgment, there is sufficient evidence to substantiate the Wife’s claim on a balance of probabilities. First, the Wife’s assertion that the sum of $134,000 deposited in the Maybank Time Deposit Account No.~4486 is a cash security to secure the loan from Maybank is borne out by Maybank’s facility letter dated 5 December 2016.[^109] Specifically, clause 3 of the facility letter provides, _inter alia_, that the facilities are secured by：

> Fresh charge on Fixed Deposit in the name of \[the Wife’s name\] for $134,000 (and interest thereon) placed with us for at least 4 years.

82     Secondly, the Wife’s assertion that she had taken a loan of $50,000 from her aunt is substantiated by the cheque drawn in the Wife’s favour. I note in particular that the cheque was dated 5 December 2016, which is the same date as the facility letter. Thirdly, there is also evidence that the sum of $50,000 was withdrawn from the aunt’s account on 6 December 2016[^110], which is the same date as the effective date of the Maybank Time Deposit Account.[^111]

83     For the above reasons, I am satisfied that the sum of $50,000 is to be excluded from the asset pool. As the maturity date (6 December 2018) is after the IJ date (16 August 2018), I shall adopt the sum of $84,000 ($134,000 - $50,000) in line with the principle that the value of the bank account is determined as at the IJ date.

84     In summary, the total value of the Wife’s bank balances to be included in the asset pool is $98,966.04 ($9,807.94 (S/N 13 – POSB Savings a/c no. ~1145) + $251.21 (S/N 14 – DBS Multiplier a/c no. ~5240) + $2,785.09 (S/N 15 – Maybank Savings a/no. ~6012) + $2,054.18 (S/N 17 – OCBC Frank a/c no.~9001) + $67.62 (S/N 19 – DBS eMulti-Currency a/c no. ~5120) + $84,000 (S/N 20 – Maybank Time Deposit a/c no. ~4486)).

##### S/N 22 to 23 - Wife’s shares

#### \[F\] Pte Ltd

85     The Wife is registered as holding 495 shares (49.5%) in F Pte Ltd. According to the Wife, the company was set up by C in October 2014 to carry on online retail and was managed by C. However, C died in November 2015 and nothing has been done since. Although the company is defunct, the Wife is unable to close it down. The company has no value.[^112] The Wife says she was not involved in the company and received no benefit. She does not want the company.[^113] The Husband asserts that the share capital should be used and that the value of the Wife’s share is $49.50.[^114] On the evidence before me, I see no reason to doubt the Wife’s claim that the company is defunct and without value.

86     Parties are well aware that the amount in dispute involves only a small sum of $49.50. They should have avoided approaching the division of assets in such a rigid and calculative manner. Focussing on inconsequential details would not only detract from their respective cases, it would also lead to a waste of time and resources in a wholly disproportionate manner: see _UYP_ (at \[4\]).

#### \[G\] Pte Ltd

87     The Wife is registered as holding 10,000 shares in G Pte Ltd. According to the Wife, G Pte Ltd was set up by the Husband in August 2010 and has been managed by the Husband. The company sells B Pte Ltd’s products such as health care and skin care products. Because everything (including the keeping of accounts) is managed by the Husband, the Wife does not have its accounts and other relevant documents[^115] until the Husband gave the records of G Pte Ltd to the Wife during discovery around 17 August 2018. Among the records was a letter dated 2 June 2016 signed by the Husband as director submitting to IRAS the tax return and financial statements for the year ended 31 July 2015 showing that G Pte Ltd suffered a loss of $6,658.41. There was another letter dated 24 October 2017 signed by the Husband as a director informing IRAS that G Pte Ltd ceased business since 1 August 2015 and would be struck off.[^116] The Wife is not involved in the company and received no benefit from it. The Wife does not want the company.[^117] The Wife’s position is that the company has no value.[^118]

88     The Husband’s position is that the share capital should be used.[^119] The Husband says G Pte Ltd used to be a company which was in active business especially between 2014 and 2015. Income of $136,154.77 was received for the year ending 31 July 2015. It was managed and operated mainly by the Wife. At first, the Husband used to be a director but the company was intended to be a platform for the Wife to do business. As the current sole director and sole shareholder of the company, the Wife can build on the assets and company structure to carry on her business. The Husband says there is value in the company for the Wife to tap on.[^120] As no formal valuation of the company was done, using the paid-up capital of the shares would be a practical way to ascertain the Wife’s share in the company, which would be $10,000.[^121]

89     I note that although the company did receive income of $136,154.77 for the year ending 31 July 2015 as the Husband has asserted, the statement of profit and loss shows that the company suffered a loss of $6,658.41 after deducting the cost of sale and operating expenses.[^122] Hence, the only objective evidence before the court indicates that this is a loss-making company. The Husband’s letter dated 24 October 2017 to the Comptroller of Income Tax reinforces the fact that the company was not doing well.[^123] The material parts of the letter read as follows:

> Dear Sir

> STRIKING OFF

> With reference to the above, we wish to inform you that our Company had:

>> a)    Ceased business activities since 1st August 2015

>> b)    Decided to strike off the company as soon as possible

> Kindly let us have your clearance before we submit the striking off documents with ACRA.

> Your prompt attention will be appreciated.

90     On the objective evidence available, I am unable to find any basis to support the Husband’s claim that there is value in the company for the Wife to tap on. In my judgment, it is more likely that the company has no value and accordingly I ascribe $0 to the Wife’s shares.

##### S/N 24 to 63 - Wife’s jewellery, bags, shoes, watches, apparels, etc (“Wife’s personal items”)

91     The parties take opposing positions on the Wife’s personal items (S/N 24 to 63).[^124] The Wife contends that items below $15,000 should be disregarded whilst the Husband asserts that there is no such blanket rule.[^125] The Husband says the Wife has numerous personal effects of value and these need to be considered collectively.[^126] Both parties referred to _BNS v BNT_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHCF 5</span> (“_BNS_”) in support of their positions.

92     In _BNS_, Debbie Ong J said as follows (at \[21\]-\[22\]):

> 21    For practical reasons, I omit the items that have minimal value, and personal items of lower resale value, from the matrimonial pool. The Court of Appeal in _Tan Hwee Lee v Tan Cheng Guan_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 4 SLR 785</span> held that courts retained a discretion to exclude items of _de minimis_ value, including inter-spousal gifts, from the matrimonial pool: “this exception is desirable… as it prevents the lower courts from being overly burdened by petty arguments over gifts of this nature” (see \[45\] to \[49\]). Notably, in determining whether an asset can be considered _de minimis_, the Court of Appeal explained that this “would depend very much on the precise factual matrix before the court” (at \[49\]).

> 22    In the present case, I exclude from the matrimonial pool electronics, paintings, furniture, and also two rings. Both parties assert, without evidence, that they paid for these rings, which were purchased on the occasion of their marriage. While inter-spousal gifts may be added into the pool, the diamond grading certificates are no longer available. The rings are therefore of questionable resale value, even if one of these excluded rings is insured for S$50,000. Having excluded the rings, which the Wife will keep, I also exclude the Husband’s Harley Davidson motorcycle, which was valued between S$10,000-S$15,000 in 2012, and which is also depreciating in nature.

93     It is clear from the above that the court has a discretion to exclude items of _de minimis_ value and this is to prevent the lower courts from overly burdened by petty arguments over the items. Whether an asset is to be considered _de minimis_ would depend on the precise factual matrix.

94     The Wife has assigned values of between $0 to $2,000 to these personal items (S/N 24-63) giving a total value of $12,080.[^127] The Husband says that the estimates used by the Wife are undervalued. The Husband has assigned values of between $500 to $10,000 to the personal items (S/N 24-63) giving a total value of $67,238.71.[^128] The Husband says that his estimates are based on his personal knowledge and where available, he has provided the current second-hand price of similar goods.[^129]

95     The Husband says that during the marriage, he gave the Wife many jewellery and luxury goods. The Wife has an expensive taste and although the items were very expensive, he bought them for the Wife because he wanted to make her happy. When the Wife left the matrimonial home on 1 February 2017, she brought these with her. The items still have considerable value and when sold, can fetch a sizeable sum.[^130]

96     The Wife says the Husband has assigned “crazy resale values” to her “old stuffs”.[^131] She is prepared to sell these items to the Husband at a 10% discount and the Husband pays the money into the matrimonial asset pool. Alternatively, these items can be allocated to the Husband at a 10% discount after the court has determined the division percentage. If the Husband is telling the truth about their resale values, he wins either way.[^132] If he does not want to keep the items, he can sell them and enjoy a generous profit.[^133]

97     This is unfortunately a case where the parties appear to have descended into the sort of petty arguments contemplated in _Tan Hwee Lee v Tan Cheng Guan_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 4 SLR 785</span> and _BNS_. The parties are quibbling over the resale values of a long list of personal effects (40 in total) most of which are highly personal in nature such as the wedding ring (S/N 25) and proposal ring (S/N 28). Even if the resale values given by the Husband are accepted, I find this to be an appropriate case for the court to exercise its discretion to exclude the items based on the _de minimis_ exception. In truth however, it is questionable whether the items can indeed fetch the high resale values estimated by the Husband. It is telling that the Husband is not prepared to have the items allocated to him by way of sale or division even at a 10% discount as proposed by the Wife despite his optimistic assessment of the resale values of these items.[^134]

98     Finally, the Husband contends that the value of the personal effects has to be considered _collectively_.[^135] I find this proposition to grate against the rationale for the exclusion as it would require the court to entertain petty arguments over otherwise _de minimis_ items in order to decide whether to exclude the items on the basis of their collective value. In any event, this was not the approach adopted in _BNS_.

##### S/N 64.1 to 64.123 - Items Wife left in the matrimonial home (Wife’s left-behind items)

99     The parties also dispute over the values of the second-hand items left in the matrimonial home (clothes, apparel, shoes and accessories).[^136] There are altogether 123 items listed in the Joint Summary.[^137] The Wife has asserted that there is no value to these items whilst the Husband has assigned values of $0 to $3,100 to the items. The Husband estimates the total value of these 123 items to be $38,383. The Husband says that he has obtained the current retail prices of first-hand goods or similar items and as a conservative estimate, given a 50% discount on the prices of these items to reach the estimated prices of these second-hand items at $38,383.[^138]

100    The arguments raised by both parties in respect the Wife’s left-behind items (S/N 64.1 to 64.123) are similar to the arguments raised in respect of the Wife’s personal items (S/N 24 to 63). For the same reasons I have explained earlier in the context of the Wife’s personal items, I find it appropriate to exercise my discretion to also exclude the Wife’s left-behind items from division.

102    According to the Wife, save for S/N 3 which was lost in 2016, the rest of the items have been sold. S/N 5 and 7-9 were sold in 2010, S/N 6 in 2011, S/N 1 in 2014, S/N 10 in 2016 and S/N 2 and 4 in January 2017. The proceeds were used on their family expenses and her personal expenses.[^140]

103    The Husband asserts that the Wife’s explanation is merely an afterthought and there are no supporting documents to the Wife’s claim.[^141] The Husband says that these items are among the many jewellery and luxury goods he purchased for the Wife during their marriage. He bought the items because the Wife expected to receive them on special occasions like her birthday, Valentine’s Day, Christmas Day and their wedding anniversary. The Husband does not recall exactly how much he paid then.[^142] The Husband says the Wife always wanted to live a very extravagant life and he tried his utmost to accede to her requests.[^143] According to him, the Wife brought from the home the jewellery and luxury items when she left.[^144] He estimates the total value of the items at $121,599.[^145]

104    The Wife left the matrimonial home on 1 February 2017. Based on the Wife’s account, she no longer had these items by this time. In fact, some of the items had already been disposed of as far back as 2010. Based on the Husband’s account, the Wife had taken the items with her when she left the matrimonial home. Apart from their bare assertions, neither party has provided any evidence to corroborate their claims.

105    Where the evidence does not point clearly to a specific conclusion, it is necessary to bear in mind the burden of proof: see _UJF_ (at \[55\]). In _UYP_ (at \[10\]), the wife had contended that the husband had other insurance policies that he failed to declare. The husband’s counsel confirmed his instructions that there were no undeclared insurance policies. The court noted that the wife did not tender any evidence to prove otherwise and accepted the husband’s position.

106    In my judgment, the onus is on the Husband to prove that the Wife has the items since he is the party asserting the existence of these items.[^146] I find that the Husband has not discharged the evidential burden on a balance of probabilities. Apart from the lack of evidence to support his assertion that the Wife has the items, there is also a lack of specificity in his evidence as to how he came to the conclusion that the Wife had taken all the items with her when she left the matrimonial home. The Husband did not state in his affidavit whether he saw the Wife taking the items when she left the matrimonial home. [^147] It is unclear whether this was merely a suspicion on his part. As against the lack of specificity, there is undisputed evidence that the Wife trades in luxury bags.[^148] In fact, the Husband has asserted that the Wife has a business trading in luxury bags.[^149] Considered against this background, the Wife’s claim that she has sold the luxury items is not implausible.

107    As it has not been proved that the Wife was in possession of the items at the operative date, there is no basis to include the items in the asset pool.

111    From the above, there are two items where the values are disputed – S/N 20 (Panerai Rose Gold Watch) and S/N 28 (99.99% shares in B Pte Ltd).

##### S/N 20 – Panerai Rose Gold Watch

112    The Husband owns a Panerai Rose Gold watch (S/N 20) with an estimated value of $18,000.[^162] The Husband says that the watch has been pawned and he intends to redeem it.[^163]

113    The Wife claims that the Husband bought the watch at around $20,000 and the value of the watch is now around $22,000. In support of her claim, she exhibited an advertisement of a Panerai Luminor Marina 1950 3 Days Automatic Brown Dial 18kt Rose Gold Men’s Watch with a current market price of $17,220.[^164]

114    The evidence produced by the Wife does not support her claim in any way. In fact, it is closer to the value estimated by the Husband. In the circumstances, I adopt the figure of $18,000 as the value of the watch.

##### S/N 28 – Husband’s 99.99% share in B Pte Ltd

115    B Pte Ltd is a company set up by the Husband on 12 July 1994.[^165] By an order of court dated 9 October 2018, a joint valuer, RSM Corporate Advisory Pte Ltd (“RSM”) was appointed to value the Husband’s shares in B Pte Ltd.[^166] The valuer has estimated the market value of the Husband’s 99.99% stake in the share capital of B Pte Ltd at $2.083 m[^167] as at 31 December 2017[^168] (“RSM Valuation Report”). This is not disputed.[^169]

116    The Husband asserts that the value of his shares in B Pte Ltd should be prorated according to the duration of the marriage (8.5 years from December 2008 to February 2017) vis-à-vis the length of the company’s operations (23.5 years from July 1994 to December 2017).[^170] The proportionate value of the shares to be included would be 8.5 years out of 23.5 years x $2.083 m = $753,425.50. This is the value of the shares which should be subject to a division.[^171] The Husband contends that this is a principled approach and would negate any gains in the value of the shares which cannot be attributed to the marriage and should not be considered an asset acquired by the parties during the marriage.[^172]

117    The Wife submits that there is no law that the value must be prorated to exclude the pre-marriage period as proposed by the Husband. If the law requires proration (which the Wife denies), it can only be if the Wife has contributed nothing whatsoever to B Pte Ltd and it is the last resort approach when the court has no evidence at all of the value of B Pte Ltd at the time of marriage. The Wife asserts that the Husband’s approach relies on the very broad assumption that the value of an asset grows immediately upon acquisition and grows in a straight line over time. While it may be true for real property which in Singapore appreciates over time in the long run, it is not true for business. Businesses can stagnate, decline or even collapse. It takes time to grow a successful business and even if it grows it does not grow in a straight line. The Wife says that at the time of marriage the value of B Pte Ltd was negligible and that it began to grow after the parties’ marriage.[^173] The Wife alleges that the Husband has suppressed audited accounts of the company which would show that the company was definitely not doing well back in 2008 and submits that an adverse inference ought to be drawn against him.[^174]

118    The Husband points out that he wanted to obtain a valuation of the shares at the date of marriage but the Wife disagreed. Since there was no agreement to value the shares at the date of marriage and the current date, the court ordered a joint valuer be appointed only to value the shares at the current date. The valuation date was later fixed at 31 December 2017.[^175] The Wife however says that it was the court’s direction at the case conference on 18 September 2018 to perform a joint valuation as at one date, i.e. the date of the AM hearing. The court also specifically directed that the Husband could at his cost procure another valuation as at any other date. Therefore, it is his strategic choice not to procure another valuation as at the date of the marriage.[^176]

119    From the above, two main issues arise for determination: (a) whether the value of the shares should be “prorated”; and (b) if so, how should the proportion of value be determined.

120    The general principle with regard to the division of assets acquired before marriage may be gleaned from the following observations of the High Court (Family Division) in _TNC v TND_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 3 SLR 1172</span> (at \[41\]) (“_TNC (High Court)”_) :

> Section 112(10)(_a_), however, places assets acquired _before_ marriage, but regarded as matrimonial assets by virtue of ordinary _usage_ or substantial _improvement_, on the same footing as those acquired during marriage (s 112(10)(_b_)). For property acquired before marriage but regarded as a matrimonial asset due to substantial improvement, Professor Leong suggests treating only the increase in value of the property brought about by the parties’ improvement as liable to division. Discounting the value of the property before marriage from the value of the property at the operative date enables the court to derive the value attributable to the parties’ efforts, which is a quintessential asset (_Elements_ at p 577). However, such discounting cannot be done for property regarded as matrimonial asset by virtue of “ordinary usage” or enjoyment since there is no discernible increase in value that can be ascribed to the parties’ efforts…

121    In light of the above, I am unable to accept the Wife’s assertion that there is “no law that the value must be prorated to exclude the pre-marriage period”. On the contrary, it is an established principle of family law that the value of a property before marriage may be discounted from the value of the property at the operative date to enable the court to derive the value attributable to the parties’ efforts.

122    In the present case, given that the shares were acquired before marriage, there is a requirement under s 112(10)(a)(ii) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 1985 Rev Ed) (“WC”) that the value of the shares must be “substantially improved during the marriage by the other party or by both parties to the marriage” for the shares to be considered a matrimonial asset: see _BUX v BUY_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHCF 4</span> (at \[17\]) (“_BUX_”). From the Joint Summary, it is clear that this is not disputed.[^177]

123    The issue in contention concerns the proportion of the shares that is subject to division. In _BUX_, a similar issue arose for determination. In that case, the matter concerns shares acquired by the wife before marriage. Debbie Ong J decided (at \[22\]-\[24\]) as follows:

> 22    I note that the Company was incorporated in 2006, three years before the marriage, and had continued to be built up during the marriage. I therefore gave an opportunity for parties to submit on the “proportion” of this asset which ought to be placed into the pool of MAs. The Wife submitted that the Company shares were worth $226,209 in 2009, and $2,160,000 in 2016, when IJ was granted. She accepted that if the Company shares were included in the pool of MAs, the proportion that should be counted to the pool ought to be the difference between these values, which is $1,933,791.

> 23    While the Husband was granted leave to file reply submissions on this particular issue, the submissions which he eventually filed on 3 October 2018 touched on various other points which do not address the question of what “proportion” of the Company shares ought to be included in the pool of MAs.

> 24    I observed that the Wife had adopted the value of the Company shares at the time when IJ was granted in her calculations. However, as I have noted above, assets should generally be valued at the time of the AM hearing. **Thus, the proportion of the Company shares to be included in the pool of MAs should be the difference between the value of the shares at the time of marriage ($226,209) and the value in 2017 ($2,138,555), which is $1,912,346.**

> (emphasis added)

124    From the above, it is clear that the proportion of the shares to be included in the asset pool is the difference between the value of the shares at the time of marriage and the value at the time of the AM hearing. This approach is reflective of the principle that only the value attributable to the parties’ efforts during marriage should be included in the asset pool. Therefore, the Wife’s assertion that the value of the shares should be determined as at the date of the AM hearing is misconceived.

125    I note that counsel for the Husband wrote to the Wife’s counsel on 30 August 2018[^178], 5 September 2018[^179] and 1 October 2018[^180] to propose that a valuation be obtained as at the date of the marriage, 11 December 2008. The Wife did not accept the proposal to obtain an expert valuation and now seek to show that the value of the company was negligible at the time the time marriage by asking this court to draw an adverse inference against the Husband on the basis that “he is lying”[^181]. I find the position taken by the Wife to be wholly untenable. It was the Husband who had repeatedly proposed to obtain an independent valuation report and it was the Wife who had refused. Yet, she accuses him of suppressing the audited accounts and lying.[^182]

126    In the absence of a proper valuation, the question that arises is - how is the value of the Husband’s shares at the time of the marriage to be determined. The Wife asserts that the value of the company was negligible at the time of the marriage as it was not doing well in 2008.[^183] She contends that if the Husband had disclosed the audited accounts for 2008, that would clearly show whether the company was profitable and also show the net asset value of the company.[^184]

127    From the valuation methodologies described in the RSM Valuation Report, it is clear that the valuation of a company is a complex exercise involving a consideration of different valuation approaches and factors and an exercise of professional judgment.[^185] The Wife is not a trained valuer and her assertion is premised on a lay assumption that equates the profitability of the company in 2008 with its market value. However, assumptions such as this that underlie the Wife’s assertion cannot be verified without a proper valuation by a trained valuer. The Wife, as noted earlier, did not agree to the Husband’s proposal to obtain a valuation of the company as at the date of marriage. She says it was the court which directed that a joint valuation be obtained as at one date (i.e. date of AM) at the case conference on 18 September 2018[^186] but that completely misses the point that the Wife herself had refused to a valuation as at the date of marriage despite repeated requests from the Husband.

128    In the absence of a proper valuation of the company as at the date of the marriage, I find the proposal to prorate the value of Husband’s shares in B Pte Ltd according to the duration of the marriage (8.5 years from December 2008 to February 2017) vis-à-vis the length of the company’s operations (23.5 years from July 1994 to December 2017) to be a reasonable alternative. Whilst the approach has its limitation, the Wife has not proposed any other alternative apart from speculating that the company had negligible value. In the circumstances, I see no reason why the approach proposed by the Husband should not be adopted using the broad-brush approach.

129    For the above reasons, I adopt the figure of $753,425.50 as the value of the Husband’s shares that is subject to division.

#### Disputed Assets

130    According to the Joint Summary, there are six assets belonging to the Husband that are disputed to be matrimonial assets.[^187]

131    Out of the six disputed assets, four are luxury items (S/N 1 to 4). The Husband says that the IWC Perpetual Calendar (S/N 1) belongs to his son from his previous marriage. The son had lent it to the Husband when he needed cash. After the Husband redeemed it, he returned the watch to the son.[^188]

132    The Husband explains that he bought the Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Offshore (S/N 4) from a second-hand watch dealer in Taiwan in 2011. It was very old with many mechanical problems. Eventually, he sold the watch to a dealer at Far East Shopping Centre.[^189] As for the Patek Phillipe Nautilus 5980 (S/N 2) and Rolex Submariner 11619, these were sold in about 2016 or 2017 as B Pte Ltd was in need of funds.[^190]

133    I have, in the context of the Wife’s luxury items, pointed out that the onus is on the Husband to prove that the Wife has the items since he is the party asserting the existence of these items.[^191] For the same reason, the onus is now on the Wife to prove that the Husband has the luxury items (S/N 1 to 4). As the Wife has not discharged the evidential burden on a balance of probabilities, there is no basis to include the items in the asset pool.

##### S/N 5 - OCBC Account No. ~1911

134    This is an account jointly held by the Husband and A. The Husband asserts that the money in the account belongs to A. He is taking the same position for the Wife’s joint account with A (POSB Kids Trust Account No. ~3044). [^192]

135    As there is no dispute that the money in the joint account belongs to A, I shall exclude this account from the asset pool.

##### S/N 6 - Sale proceeds of Tampines flat

136    The Husband used to own the Tampines flat in his sole name. This was purchased before the marriage on 1 December 2000 before he met the Wife.[^193] The transfer of the Tampines flat to his sole name was effected on 1 July 2002, more than 6 years before the Husband and the Wife got marriage. According to the Husband, he and the Wife stayed in the Tampines flat as a “temporary measure off and on” for the first one to two years of the marriage.[^194] The Tampines flat was sold in April 2018 and all the proceeds of sale in the sum of $620,000 were used to pay the outstanding HDB loan and refund his CPF account.[^195] He only received the “sale proceeds” because he turned 55 years old in April 2018 and could withdraw his CPF moneys, part of which was the refund to his CPF account from the sale of the Tampines flat. These were deposited into his OCBC Current Account No. ~7001 on 30 April 2018. The Husband’s position is that the Tampines flat is not a matrimonial asset as the parties had never treated the Tampines flat as their home and had alternated between living at the Wife’s flat and the Husband’s flat.[^196] Therefore the sum of $447,061.71 should be excluded from the asset pool and deducted from his bank balances.[^197]

137    The Wife says that after their marriage in December 2008, they lived together as husband and wife in the Tampines flat until the end of 2010 when they moved into the current matrimonial home at Sirat Road. They never stayed at her HDB flat as the Husband had insisted that the Wife must move in with him and depend on him and not the other way around.[^198]

138    It is not disputed that the Tampines flat was acquired before the marriage. Under s 112(10)(a)(i) of the WC, an asset that one or both of the parties acquired before the marriage will fall within the term “matrimonial asset” if it was:

> … ordinarily used or enjoyed by both parties or one or more of their children while the parties are residing together for shelter or transportation or for household, education, recreational, social or aesthetic purposes;

139    In _TNC v TND_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 34</span>, a similar issue arose in respect of a property (the Bayshore property) acquired by the husband prior to the marriage. The husband disputed that the Bayshore property was a matrimonial home on the basis that the parties lived there for a period of only 15 months. The High Court held that the Bayshore property was a matrimonial asset. Before the Court of Appeal, the husband submitted that, at the highest, only the CPF moneys used to pay for the mortgage instalments of the Bayshore property from the date of the marriage to the date of the IJ should be included as the net value of the Bayshore property. The Court of Appeal in holding that the High Court was correct to include the Bayshore property in the pool of matrimonial assets, observed as follows (at \[33\] & \[36\]):

> 33    In the present case, before the Judge, the wife argued that nothing in s 112(10)(a)(i) of the Charter allows for an asset which has acquired the status of a matrimonial asset because of the application of that provision to somehow lose that status subsequently. The husband, however, contended that the Bayshore property was not a matrimonial asset because the family had lived there for a period of only 15 months. The Judge rejected the husband’s argument (at \[18\] of the Judgment). Whilst holding that the requirement of ordinary use would not be satisfied if the use was “occasional or casual”, the Judge found that a residence of 15 months’ was sufficient to constitute ordinary use for shelter and thus, that the Bayshore property was a matrimonial asset. To her, examples of casual use were staying in a property for only 21 days out of 14 years of marriage or on only two occasions throughout the marriage. In the Judgment, the Judge did not deal directly with BGT v BTU or the wife’s argument that once an asset was a matrimonial asset it was always a matrimonial asset.

> …

> 36    Thus, in relation to the Bayshore property, we are of the view that the Judge was correct to include it in the pool of matrimonial assets. The Judge had already taken into account the fact the property was used as a matrimonial home for only 15 months by classifying it in Group B and assigning a much higher weight to direct contributions vis-à-vis indirect contributions. There is no basis to disturb the Judge’s decision on the character of the Bayshore property since as the Judge noted, the parties occupation of it was a settled domestic occupation for a substantial period. The husband’s appeal therefore fails in this respect.

140    In the present case, even if I accept the Husband’s assertion that the parties had alternated between living in the Wife’s flat and his flat (which is disputed by the Wife), it is clear that the stay at the Tampines flat was not “occasional or casual”. By his own admission, the stay at the Tampines flat was the living arrangement for the first one to two years of the marriage. Clearly, the Tampines flat was not a casual residence. I find that the Tampines flat was ordinarily used by both parties for shelter and therefore constitutes a matrimonial asset. For this reason, I find no basis to deduct the sum of $447,061.71 from his bank balances on this ground.

141    Furthermore, the Husband’s submission is premised on the assumption that the sum of $447,061.71 has not been expended since it was deposited into his OCBC Current Account No. ~7001 on 30 April 2018 such that this sum was still existing and capable of being excluded from the asset pool as at the IJ date (16 May 2019). However, it is clear that this is not the case. From the Joint Summary[^199], the balance in the Husband’s his OCBC Current Account No. ~7001 had already fallen to $132,789.29 as at 31 May 2018. This suggests that a substantial amount of the sale proceeds of $447,061.71 had already been utilised within the short span of a month from the time the proceeds were deposited into the account. As the sale proceeds would have commingled with other funds in the account, it is also questionable whether the balance of $132,789.29 in this account can be attributable to the sale proceeds. In fact, the total value of his bank accounts as computed by the Husband as at May 2018 is $168,049.70.[^200] Even if this total value is taken (the Husband has submitted that the sale proceeds be deducted from his “bank balances”[^201]), it is still less than the sale proceeds of $447,061.71. As the Husband has not shown that the sale proceeds are still subsisting as at the operative date, there is in reality nothing to deduct.

## Summary of Husband’s assets to be included

142    In summary, the total value of the Husband’s assets to be included in the asset pool is tabulated as follows:

143    I did not include the four disputed luxury items[^206] (the Husband’s luxury items)[^207] in the asset pool as it has not been proved on a balance of probabilities that the Husband was in possession of the items at the operative date.[^208] I have also excluded the OCBC Account No.~1911[^209] as it is not disputed that the money in the joint account belongs to A.[^210] I did not deduct the sum of $447,061.71 from the bank balances of the Husband (proceeds from sale of the Tampines flat) for the reasons stated earlier.[^211]

145    Save for the DBS Personal Loan (S/N 11), all the values are agreed.

146    It is not disputed that on 17 January 2017, the Wife had obtained a DBS Personal Loan of $100,000.[^213] According to the Husband, the Wife agreed to lend him $80,000 out of this sum. At that time, the Husband was struggling with cash flow problems. Between February 2017 and June 2017, the Husband paid the Wife $10,500 per month (total $52,500). In about August 2017, the Husband handed the Wife an additional $20,000 to repay the loan. There is still an outstanding sum of $7,500 (being $80,000 less $52,500 less $20,000) which he has not returned to the Wife.[^214] The Husband’s position is that the value of the liability to be accounted for in the pool of assets should be at most $27,500.[^215]

147    The Wife’s response, as set out in her affidavit[^216], is as follows:

> In paragraphs 156-158 of 2DAOM, \[Husband\] talks about the $100,000 loan I took from DBS to help him out, and his payment of $72,500 to me. It is a fact that after I had fled from him due to his violence, he cut off my salary and stopped payment of household expenses, \[A\] expenses and my personal expenses. The only way for \[A\] and me to survive was to use up the $72,500 first to pay for such expenses.

148    The Husband disputes the Wife’s claim that she had used the sum he had repaid her household expenses, A’s expenses and her personal expenses. The Husband points out that the Wife’s credit card statements show that she continues to splurge on luxury and branded clothes and fine dining.[^217] The Husband also points out that the Wife failed in her claim for interim maintenance for herself and it is obvious that she has no genuine need for financial help.[^218]

149    In my judgment, since it is not disputed that the Husband did pay the Wife $72,500 towards repayment of the loan she had taken from DBS, the value of the liability should be taken as $27,500.

150    I should point out that there is a fundamental question as to whether the sum of $27,500 should even be treated as a liability to be deducted from the asset pool. This is because the liability does not relate to any specific matrimonial asset. It does not diminish the net value of any asset: see _TNC (High Court)_ (at \[26\]) and _VDN v VDO_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGFC 146</span> (at \[36\]-\[38\]). However, since parties have agreed that the liabilities under S/N 1 to 11 are relevant to determine the net value of the asset pool[^219], this issue does not arise for determination.

151    There is however one liability that is disputed as relevant to determine net value. This is the personal loan from the Wife’s friend to her:[^220]

152    The Wife says that she had borrowed from her good friend N to pay UOB hire purchase instalments and road tax to continue using her car as the Husband had stopped paying her hire purchase instalments in September 2017.[^221]

153    The Husband says there is no reason why the Wife needed to borrow the sum of the hire purchase instalments of $2,426 per month. The Wife has been able to continue her excessive spending even after she left the matrimonial home in February 2017. [^222]

154    In substance, the alleged loan from N to the Wife concerns an issue of maintenance rather than division of assets. In fact, the Wife had in her application for interim maintenance (SUM 12) listed the hire purchase instalments for her car as an expense. She had also referred to the alleged loan from N. The learned District Judge dismissed her claim and found that she had considerable income and was able to provide for herself.[^223] As such, the issue relating to the loan from N had already been raised and adjudicated upon in her maintenance application.

155    Moreover, the alleged loan from N does not relate to any specific matrimonial asset nor does it diminish the net value of any asset. In _TNC (High Court)_, to arrive at the net value of the total pool of matrimonial assets, the court took into account the tax liability on the husband’s pension earnings and explained (at \[26\]) as follows:

> Because this liability relates to a matrimonial asset, and diminishes its net value, I have deducted this amount from the pool.

156    Conversely, it may be said that if a liability does not relate to a matrimonial asset, it should not be taken into account in arriving at the net value of the asset pool since the liability does not diminish the net value of any asset. Hence, even if the Wife’s claim is accepted, the loan from N towards the payment of her hire purchase instalments and road tax is not a relevant liability to be taken into account in determining the net value of the asset pool.

157    For the above reasons, I am unable to find any basis to deduct the alleged loan of $23,324 from the asset pool.

## Total Pool of Matrimonial Assets

158    Given my findings above, the net value of the asset pool that falls for division is $2,062,039.54. This is presented in tabular form as follows:

## Adverse Inference

159    It is not disputed that the Husband set up \[O\] Laboratories Pte Ltd (“O Singapore”) in 2004[^229] which had dealings with a Japanese company \[O\] Japan Inc (“O Japan”).[^230] The Wife says that in September 2010, the Husband obtained shares in O Japan and became the second largest shareholder of O Japan (at least 33%).[^231] She points to the Husband’s DAOM where he himself says that in 2010/2011 there was a share swap whereby O Japan became the sole shareholder of O Singapore and the Husband in turn held shares in O Japan.[^232] The website of O Japan states that it has a capital of US $1,000,000 with annual sales of US$25,000 and the Husband is its director.[^233] The Wife submits that there is documentary evidence that the Husband is still managing O Japan. The Wife contends that an adverse inference should be drawn against the Husband for his failure to disclose his shareholding in O Japan.[^234]

160    The Husband says that the Wife is just making a spurious allegation. The Husband does not have any shares in O Japan and neither is he a director of the company. In his DAOM, he disclosed that he used to hold shares in O Singapore, which had business dealings with O Japan. O Japan later took over the Husband’s shares in O Singapore. When the Husband filed his DAOM, he mistakenly thought that there was a share swap resulting in O Japan taking over and him taking over shares in O Japan. This was clarified by a letter dated 2 August 2018[^235] where the Husband says that O Japan’s acquisition of shares in O Singapore was in exchange for O Japan taking over the debts and liabilities of O Singapore. Nothing was raised by the Wife after this letter was sent until almost one year later in her second affidavit filed on 25 July 2019 where the Wife says the Husband obtained shares in O Japan and held at least 33% of the shares in this company. The Husband says that the Wife is making this allegation on hindsight and there is no basis to her claim.[^236]

161    The Husband says what the Wife is relying on is a website listing the Husband as one of the “directors” in O Japan. This website is not dated and the recent information appearing on the website is 2010. There is no evidence of the reliability of the information on the website and whether the Japanese concept of “director” is the same as under Singapore law. As far as the Husband is aware, he was never a director of O Japan and does not have free access to information of O Japan as the Wife seems to think. A possible explanation of why the website lists the Husband in O Japan is because of the collaborative project between O Japan, O Singapore (of which the Husband was a director at the material time) and O Hong Kong. The Wife has not adduced any evidence of a registry of shareholders or directors of O Japan to show objective evidence that the Husband has an interest or a directorship in the company.[^237]

162    The requirements for drawing an adverse inference as set out by the Court of Appeal in _Chan Tin Sun_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGCA 2</span> (at \[62\]) and reiterated in _BPC v BPB_ (at \[60\]) are as follows:

> 60    The court is entitled to draw an adverse inference against a party who fails to comply with his or her duty of full and frank disclosure of the matrimonial assets: see _ANJ v ANK_ at \[29\] and _NK v NL_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 3 SLR 743</span> (“_NK v NL_”) at \[57\]. The court may do so, provided that (_Chan Tin Sun_ at \[62\]):

>> (a)    there is a substratum of evidence that establishes a p_rima facie_ case against the person against whom the inference is to be drawn; and

>> (b)    that person must have had some particular access to the information he is said to be hiding.

163    On the evidence before me, I find that the Husband did not actively withhold information on his alleged shareholding in O Japan. It seems highly unlikely that he would have stated in his DAOM filed on 13 July 2018 that there was a share swap if he had wanted to withhold information.[^238] The share swap, it should be noted, was disclosed voluntarily by the Husband. As it turned out, he was mistaken about the share swap and had clarified the mistake as early as 2 August 2018 by way of letter to the Wife’s lawyers. [^239] In his letter, he clarified that he does not have any interest in O Japan and that the share swap which resulted in O Japan’s acquisition of shares in O Singapore was in exchange of O Japan taking over the debts and liabilities of O Singapore. He also provided the Wife’s lawyers with a list of shareholders of O Japan he obtained from O Japan which had provided to him out of goodwill. He also provided an official translation of the list of shareholders. The list shows that the Husband is not a shareholder of O Japan.

164    Despite his clarification given on 2 August 2018, the Wife sought to leverage on the mistake[^240] by holding the Husband to what he had mistakenly stated in his DAOM. The Wife says that she does not know whether the shareholder list provided by the Husband is real or accurate and the Husband, as director, has power to and can always obtain a duly certified register of shareholders.[^241]

165    The Husband has maintained that he is not a director of O Japan but the Wife refers to O Japan’s website which listed the Husband as one of the directors under the description “Senior Management”. However, the website also sets out an organisation chart which listed O Singapore as a “Fully Owned Subsidiary” of O Japan. As the Husband was a director of O Singapore at the material time, it is possible that the Husband was listed as a director under “Senior Management” for that reason. There could also be other explanations such as those provided by the Husband. Clearly, it is impossible to know why the Husband is listed on the website without clarifications from O Japan, but the point here simply is that it is unsafe to rely on the information on the website without proper verifications. Since the Wife is insisting that the Husband is a director of O Japan and has at least a 33% share in the company, the onus is on her to prove her assertions. However, she has not discharged the burden of proof. There is no evidence that she has even attempted to obtain verifications through a company search of O Japan. Overall, I am unable to find any substratum of evidence against the Husband.

166    The Wife has also contended that the Husband has failed to give full and frank disclosure of his watches, of the status of his HDB flat and his secret accounts”.[^242] I have given due consideration to these allegations but find no basis to draw an adverse inference against the Husband.

## Proportions of Division

#### Whether matrimonial home should be dealt with separately

167    The Wife says that the matrimonial home at Sirat Road is to be treated separately[^243] and the net value after deducting housing loans and CPF refunds and transfer/sale expenses should be equally shared.[^244] The matrimonial home was purchased in 2010.[^245] According to the Wife, at the time of purchase, the parties wanted to make it clear how they should share the matrimonial home should either of them die or should they divorce so that there would be no dispute. This is because this was their second marriage and each of them has their children. They both had gone through the divorce process and knew the difficulties. Instead of joint tenancy which is usual for married couples, the Husband said that they should hold the matrimonial home as tenants-in-common in equal shares so that should either of them die or should they divorce, each of them would have half share.[^246]

168    The Husband disputes that parties were contemplating divorce when they purchased the matrimonial home.[^247] According to the Husband, the property was held as tenants-in-common because the parties considered that the Wife was 20 years younger than the Husband and most likely to outlive him. The Wife had initially asked for it to be held as a joint tenancy, which would give her 100% of the property when the Husband passed away. The Husband did not agree as he wanted to make sure that his children also get a share of his estate. They eventually decided to hold the matrimonial home as tenants-in-common.[^248] Hence, the intention was not that the property was always meant to be shared equally but more of the reason that the Husband wanted the ability to will half of the property away for his children because he had put in a lot of money into the property when it was bought and it was his main asset. The Husband’s position is that the matrimonial home should be included in the asset pool and dealt with globally.[^249]

169    As a starting point, the onus is on the Wife to prove on a balance of probabilities that there was an agreement between the parties with respect to the ownership and division made in contemplation of divorce. However, the Wife by her bare assertions has not shown that the account given by her is more likely to be true. Indeed, I find the account given by the Husband to be equally likely, if not more believable when considered against the objective evidence, i.e. (a) the Husband is 20 years older than the Wife; (b) there was no reason for the parties to be contemplating divorce at the time of the purchase of the matrimonial home; and (c) the Husband’s account is largely corroborated by the Wife who confirmed in her affidavit that it was the Husband who suggested that they hold the matrimonial home as tenants-in-common.[^250]

170    Even if the Wife’s account is accepted, it is trite law that the court is not bound to enforce any such agreement. In _UKA v UKB_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHCF 7</span>, Debbie Ong J said (at \[21\]) as follows:

> Section 112(2)(e) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“WC”) provides that the Court, in exercising its discretion to divide matrimonial assets, must have regard to “any agreement between the parties with respect to the ownership and division of the matrimonial assets made in contemplation of divorce”. The Court is not bound to enforce any such agreement, but will determine the weight to ascribe to the agreement considering all the circumstances of the case (_TQ v TR and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 2 SLR(R) 961</span>) …

171    Further, the existence of an agreement is not a reason by itself to treat the property separately. It is simply one of the factors that the court will take into account under s 112 of the WC. As noted by the Court of Appeal in _ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGCA 34</span> (“_ANJ_”) (at \[28\]):

> The above principles are germane to the general run of matrimonial cases where the parties’ direct and indirect contributions are the only two factors engaged under s 112 (ie, s 112(2)(a) and (d)) when the court’s powers to divide matrimonial assets are called upon. We are mindful that there remains a number of other factors under s 112, including the needs of the children; **the presence of an agreement between the parties with respect to the ownership and division of matrimonial assets**; period of rent-free occupation or other benefit enjoyed by one party in the matrimonial home to the exclusion of the other party; and the matters referred to in s 114(1) relating to a maintenance order for the wife. Insofar as the remaining factors become relevant for consideration in the appropriate case, the court is well-advised to make **adjustments as it deems necessary to the principles** stated in this judgment for the purposes of reaching a just and equitable result on the facts before it.

> (emphasis added)

172    There are established principles as to when an asset may be treated separately. Assets may be divided according to the “classification methodology” or the “global assessment methodology”. In _TNC (High Court)_, the court explained as follows:

> 39    The first methodology, "the global assessment methodology", is far more commonly used than the “classification methodology”. Pursuant to the classification methodology, only the direct contributions may vary. The classification approach “would be appropriate where there are multiple classes of assets, and where the parties have made different contributions” to each class: _NK v NL_ at \[35\]. The weightage accorded to indirect contributions must remain constant in relation to each class of assets, since indirect contributions can only be assessed and applied at the end of the marriage: _AYQ v AYR and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 1 SLR 476</span> at \[22\] to \[23\]. The court must avoid the “blinkered” approach where “varying weights are accorded for indirect contributions in different matrimonial asset classes” (at \[23\]).

> 40    Since the presence of different direct contributions to different assets has never stood in the way of a court dividing the matrimonial assets globally, there must be something more to indicate that the classification methodology may be the more suitable approach. In my view, assets can be separately divided if some are not wholly the gains of the co-operative partnership of efforts that the marriage represents. Professor Leong Wai Kum stated in _Elements of Family Law in Singapore_ (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2013) (“_Elements_”) at p 577 that “\[t\]he power to divide matrimonial assets is driven by the motive to share the _gains_ of the marital partnership as fairly as possible between the former marital partners” (emphasis added). In Professor Leong’s view, there is a meaningful distinction to be made between “quintessential matrimonial assets”, which are assets that wholly represent the gains of the marital partnership, and those which are not. She describes assets acquired _during_ the marriage by the _efforts_ of one or both parties as “quintessential” matrimonial assets (_Elements_ at p 557).

> 41    Section 112(10)(_a_), however, places assets acquired _before_ marriage, but regarded as matrimonial assets by virtue of ordinary _usage_ or substantial _improvement_, on the same footing as those acquired during marriage (s 112(10)(_b_)). For property acquired before marriage but regarded as a matrimonial asset due to substantial improvement, Professor Leong suggests treating only the increase in value of the property brought about by the parties’ improvement as liable to division. Discounting the value of the property before marriage from the value of the property at the operative date enables the court to derive the value attributable to the parties’ efforts, which is a quintessential asset (_Elements_ at p 577). However, such discounting cannot be done for property regarded as matrimonial asset by virtue of “ordinary usage” or enjoyment since there is no discernible increase in value that can be ascribed to the parties’ efforts. This is why the use of the classification approach for such assets may be more appropriate.

173    It is clear from the above that the classification approach is appropriate where it is not possible to discount the value of the property before marriage so as to derive the value of the property attributable to the parties’ efforts. This is however not the case here as the matrimonial home is a quintessential asset.

174    In _TQU_, the Court of Appeal made the following observations with regard to the classification methodology (at \[100\]):

> The classification methodology may be suitable where an adverse inference is drawn against a party in relation to one class of asset, or where there is a clear reason to make a different calculation, under _ANJ v ANK_, in relation to one class of assets (_BNS v BNT_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 213</span> at \[32\]).

175    None of these reasons exist in relation to the matrimonial home. For all the above reasons, there is no basis to treat the matrimonial home separately from the other assets.

#### Whether the structured approach should be applied

176    The Wife contends that the present case falls into “unchartered territory” as neither _ANJ_ nor _TNL v TNK_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 15</span> (“_TNL_”) applies because both the Husband and Wife work together in one business and their family’s spending was derived from that business.[^251] Taking into account their respective contributions to the business and the household and family, the Wife submits that a fair and rational division must be 50:50.[^252] Another vital factor that impels the division towards 50:50 is the fact that the Wife is not claiming maintenance for herself.[^253] Taking into account adverse inference, the Wife submits that the final division should be 60:40 in favour of the Wife.[^254]

177    The Husband’s position is that the structured approach set out in _ANJ_ should be applied.[^255] Applying the _ANJ_ approach, the Husband’s computation in tabulated form is as follows:[^256]

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="25.2949410117976%"> <col width="45.4709058188362%"> <col width="29.2341531693661%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Husband</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Wife</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Ratio of Direct Contribution</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">80.77%</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">19.23 %</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Ratio of Indirect Contribution</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">70%</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">30%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Average Ratio</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">75:385%</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">24.615%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Adjusted Average Ratio</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(70% weightage for Direct Contributions)</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">77.54%</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">22.46%</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

178    In _ANJ_, the Court of Appeal set out a structured approach towards the division of matrimonial assets under s 112 of the WC. The structured approach involves three broad steps by which the ratio of the parties’ direct contributions is first ascertained, relative to that of the other party. This is followed by ascribing a second ratio of the parties’ indirect contributions, relative to that of the other party and finally deriving the parties’ overall contributions relative to each other by taking an average of the two ratios (see _Twiss, Christopher James Hans v Twiss, Yvonne Prendergast_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGCA 52</span> at \[17\]).

179    In _TNL_, the Court of Appeal had the occasion to revisit _ANJ_. The Court of Appeal’s reconsideration of the _ANJ_ approach in Single-Income Marriages “stems from the fact that ANJ approach tends to unduly favour the working spouse over the non-working spouse”. In particular, the Court of Appeal noted that under Step 1, the working spouse in a Single-Income Marriage would be accorded “100% (or close to 100%)” of direct contributions. The Court of Appeal noted further that the working spouse would be accorded a “substantial percentage under Step 2 solely on the basis of his or her indirect financial contributions, and this could well be the case even if he or she made little or no non-financial contributions”. This means that the non-working spouse is “doubly (and severely) disadvantaged”. Hence, while the _ANJ_ approach works well in “Dual-Income Marriages”, the approach should not be applied to “Single-Income Marriages” (at \[41\], \[43\] and \[45\]).

180    In the present case, the Wife by her own account was a working spouse. She says that she worked in the same business (B Pte Ltd) with the Husband and they both derived money from B Pte Ltd for expenses of family and personal expenses.[^257] According to the Wife, her last drawn salary was $16,500.[^258] The Husband says that she has a business trading in branded luxury bags[^259] and the business has given her the means to sustain her exorbitant spending even without his financial support.[^260] From my determination of the parties’ matrimonial assets and liabilities, the net value of the assets in Wife’s name less liabilities ($299,690.44 - $27,500 = $272,190.44) is more than that of the Husband’s ($771,425.50 - $845,041.72 = ($73,616.22)).[^261] In her application for interim maintenance (SUM 12), the court found that the Wife has substantial income.[^262] By any account, this cannot be said to be a case where the Wife is “doubly (and severely) disadvantaged”.

181    In _ANJ_ (at \[30\]), the Court of Appeal made it clear “we do not propose to say these principles are necessarily exhaustive, nor do we expect them to be hard and fast rules that must immutably be applied even to cases of exceptional facts.” In my judgment, there are no exceptional facts in the present case that would warrant a departure from the structured approach. In the circumstances, I agree with the Husband that the structured approach ought to be applied in this case.

## Parties’ direct contributions

#### Joint Assets

##### Matrimonial Home

182    In respect of the matrimonial home at Sirat Road,[^263] the Husband states in the Joint Summary[^264] that the total amounts paid are $911,226.97 and $90,000 by the Husband and Wife respectively. The Husband has provided detailed explanations as regards the various components that made up the sum of $911,226.97 and $90,000. The Wife did not set out her position with respect to the parties’ direct contributions to the matrimonial home in the Joint Summary save to assert that there was an express agreement that the matrimonial home be equally divided when marriage ends by death or divorce.[^265]

183    The breakdown provided by the Husband is as follows:[^266]

184    I note that although the sum of $53,000 came from the Wife’s CPF account,[^267] the Husband has allocated this amount as his direct contribution on the basis that the Wife only received CPF moneys because the Husband made arrangement for the Wife to be paid a portion of his salary which came from B Pte Ltd. The Wife says that the Husband falsely downplays her role in B Pte Ltd saying that her salary was given to her as allowance out of his share of earnings and that she did not contribute to B Pte Ltd at all. The Wife says that after the marriage, she worked very hard with him to build up B Pte Ltd to what it is today.[^268] The Wife states that she was an employee of B Pte Ltd and her last drawn gross monthly income (including salary, allowances, commissions, benefits and bonuses) for June 2017 was $16,500. The payslips exhibited by the Wife state that she is an employee of B Pte Ltd.[^269]

185    In my judgment, the sum of $53,000 should be allocated to the Wife as her direct contribution to the matrimonial home. Even if it is true that the Wife was given the salary by virtue of family connection, B Pte Ltd is a separate legal entity and payments by B Pte Ltd to the Wife in connection with her employment should not be attributed to the Husband: see _UQZ v URA_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGFC 2</span> (at \[51\]). Moreover, for reasons which I will explain later in the context of the parties’ indirect contributions, the evidence does not support the Husband’s assertion that the Wife did not contribute to B Pte Ltd.

186    The Wife states that she paid $109,038.61 from the sale of her Tampines flat[^270] though the Husband points out that two sums totalling $19,000 were withdrawn from the loan account by cheques on 28 April 2010 and 29 April 2010. This means that the Wife paid about $90,000 (being $109,038.61 less $19,000) towards the matrimonial home.[^271] I accept that the amount to be attributed to the Wife as her cash contribution towards the matrimonial home is $90,000.

187    The mortgage of $425,625.09 refers to the UOB housing loan repaid using cash and CPF.[^272] I accept that the cash portion of the mortgage has been paid by the Husband. However, part of the loan is also being repaid using CPF funds deducted from the Wife’s CPF Account. [^273] The amount deducted from the Wife’s CPF account is $98,991.37 as at 9 July 2018.[^274] This amount should be attributed to the Wife as her direct contribution.

188    The Wife does not dispute that the Husband paid for the deposit, stamp duty and legal fee.[^275]

189    With regard to the renovation of $328,023.33, the Wife says that although the Husband was in charge of making the payments, the money used was from both of them because it ultimately came from B Pte Ltd which they were both working hard together for. The Wife also disputed some of the Husband’s accounting.[^276] The Husband says that there is no document to support the Wife’s claims and whatever money from B Pte Ltd which the Husband used was recorded as a loan and part of the Husband’s liabilities to be repaid to the company.[^277] The Wife also disputed expenses incurred after she moved out on 1 February 2017[^278] but the Husband’s position is that these renovations should be included because they improved the valuation of the property which has been valued after the Wife moved out and should be valued as close to the AM hearing date as possible.[^279] Having considered the evidence and submissions, I find no reason to disturb the allocation of the sum of $328,0233.33 to the Husband as his direct contribution.

190    In the circumstances, the direct contributions of the parties to the matrimonial home, re-tabulated, is as follows:

##### UOB Joint Account

191    In respect of the UOB Joint Account HomePlus a/c no~7501,[^280] the Husband states in the Joint Summary[^281] that the total amount of $17,840.23 should be allocated to him as his direct contribution. The Wife did not set out her position with respect to the parties’ direct contributions to the joint account save to assert that the division formula set out in _ANJ_ is not applicable.[^282] Since the money in the joint account is fully funded by the Husband out of his salary from B Pte Ltd,[^283] the sum of $17,840.23 should be allocated to the Husband as his direct contribution.

#### Wife’s Assets

192    In determining the direct contributions towards the Wife’s assets,[^284] I have excluded contributions relating to the Land Rover Range Rover Evoque (Kahn Design) and the Wife’s shares in F Pte Ltd and G Pte Ltd as these assets are assessed to have zero net value. I have also excluded contributions relating to the Wife’s personal items and left-behind items since these items have been excluded from the asset pool on the _de minis_ exception.

193    In the circumstances, the Wife’s assets for which direct contributions have to be allocated are:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="51.34%"> <col width="48.66%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Asset Description</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Value</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">The Tembusu Property</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$60,347.11</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Wife’s insurance policies</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$56,011.22</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Wife’s bank balances</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$98,966.04</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Wife’s CPF funds</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$84,366.07</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Total</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$299,690.44</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

194    Out of the above items, the Husband submits that the Wife’s CPF funds should be attributed to him[^285] for the same reason that he had arranged for the Wife to be paid a portion of his salary which came from B Pte Ltd.[^286] I have, for reasons explained earlier, rejected that contention.[^287]

195    In the circumstances, the direct contributions to the Wife’s assets are to be allocated wholly to the Wife, i.e. $299,690.44.

#### Husband’s Assets

196    I have earlier determined that the total value of the Husband’s assets to be $771,425.50.[^288] As there is no evidence that the Wife has made any direct contribution to the acquisition of these assets, the sum of $771,425.50 shall be allocated wholly to the Husband as his direct contribution towards his assets.

#### Summary of direct contributions

197    In summary, the parties’ direct contributions to the total asset pool are as follows:

## Parties’ indirect contributions

198    The Husband submits that the indirect contribution ratio between the parties should be 70:30 in his favour.[^289] As the Wife takes the position that the structured approach in _ANJ_ is not applicable, she did not submit on the indirect contribution ratio.[^290] As noted earlier, [^291] the Wife’s position is that the final division should be 60:40 in her favour.

199    The Wife says that the family’s source of money is from B Pte Ltd. B Pte Ltd gives a salary of $16,500 to the Wife and $21,000 to the Husband, and in addition, the parties used moneys from B Pte Ltd other than by way of salary to pay for their lavish family’s spending. The Wife does not deny that the Husband has contributed to B Pte Ltd but says that she too has contributed to the company. [^292] Her contributions include travelling everywhere with the Husband for business, spending time in Taiwan and China for the company’s production process, finding a factory in Taiwan for the company, coming up with the idea of producing pet food supplements, discussing business proposals with the Husband as the Husband needed the Wife’s insight especially on cosmetic and beauty products, reviewing reports and documents of the subordinates, entertaining suppliers, customers and business associates, bringing lots of business for the company and even working during public holidays and festivals like Chinese New Year to build up the company.[^293]

200    The Wife says that during the marriage, she oversaw the management of the family’s household as the Husband was busy minding his business and travelled a lot and for long periods of time. Even when the Husband was in Singapore, he was hardly at home except at night for dinner.[^294] In 2012, the Wife suffered from a slipped disc due to doing too much housework.[^295] The Wife also shopped for and bought all household supplies and equipment, groceries and food.[^296]

201    Despite having a domestic helper, the Wife says that she often personally cooked lunch for A, and dinner for the Husband, his son from his first marriage and A.[^297] The Wife has been constantly attending to A’s emotional needs and often drove A to school in the morning and accompany her to tuition classes, doctors and other activities.[^298] The Wife says that she also cared for the Husband throughout the marriage such as taking good care of him when he was sick[^299] and accompanying the Husband to business meetings, doctors and the airport.[^300]

202    The Wife does not deny that the Husband’s non-financial contributions include driving A to school, tuition and enrichment classes, telling A to study hard and hiring a piano teacher and golf coach for A.[^301] The Wife says that while the Husband might have contributed more towards B Pte Ltd, she has contributed more towards the household and family.[^302]

203    The Husband says that the Wife did not make any contribution towards B Pte Ltd. The Wife’s only contribution was to attend company dinners and functions as the Husband’s wife.[^303] In the early years, the Wife helped with simple administrative matters like booking tickets and hotels and making reservations for meals with clients. That was all there is to the Wife’s contribution.[^304]

204    The Husband says that he was the primary breadwinner of the family and made the bulk of the household expenses. On the other hand, the Wife continued to spend exorbitantly at the family’s expense. The Husband chalked up huge liabilities to fund the Wife’s spending during the marriage and is still suffering the consequences even now.[^305]

205    The Husband says the Wife hardly cared for A during the marriage.[^306] Although the Husband had a full-time job, he dedicated himself to the family. He made it a point to return home to see A and encouraged A in her studies.[^307] The Husband says the parties hired a domestic helper for the large part of the marriage as the Wife claimed she did not know how to do simple housework and wanted a maid to serve her.[^308]

206    The Husband says that throughout the marriage, instead of improving the welfare of the family, the Wife’s conduct had adversely affected the family’s wellbeing and that this should be considered by the court in attributing a ratio to the parties’ indirect contributions.[^309] The Husband says the Wife spent extravagantly which led to the accumulation of significant debt by the Husband. The Wife had a lifestyle of drinking and partying and there were multiple incidents during the marriage when the Wife’s behaviour caused a lot of unhappiness and misery to the family. Although the Wife was running her own businesses and trading in luxury goods, she never shared any of her gains with the family. All this could only mean that she spent very little time with the family or for the family. All her efforts and time and money were focused elsewhere.[^310]

207    Whilst the Wife has acknowledged the Husband’s indirect contribution to the family, I note that the Husband has been highly dismissive of any contribution made by the Wife. When the Wife accompanied the Husband for the company functions, the Husband says she was just there to latch on to the free lunches.[^311] When the Wife gives inputs on product development and marketing strategy, the Husband says this was just part of their day-to-day conversation as husband and wife.[^312] When the Wife visited the factories in China and Taiwan, the Husband says this was just a chance for the Wife to have an overseas vacation.[^313] When the Wife went to Hong Kong and Japan and met business partners with the Husband, the Husband says this was just so that the Wife could go shopping.[^314] When the Wife was employed by B Pte Ltd, the Husband says this was just to encourage her to do something useful with her life.[^315]

208    The scornful tone towards the Wife, however justified it may be to the Husband, is indicative of a lack of objectivity on his part and suggests that there is a need to view his assertions with caution. Why would the Wife latch on to free lunches when by his own assertion, the Wife lives a life of extravagance and abundance? It is clear to me even from the Husband’s evidence that the Wife did contribute to B Pte Ltd. In fact, this was acknowledged by the Husband himself in a tender message to the Wife on 22 February 2017:[^316]

> Let’s move on with stronger love and happy forever. **We work hard to build our skin biz together. We have factory, technology and good formulation.** Let \[A\] grow up in healthy family.

> The cancellation of Finland trip has a purpose. God is testing our love for reason.

> I love you forever. I just don’t know how to express…

> (emphasis added)

209    There is no doubt that the Husband’s contribution to B Pte Ltd is greater than the Wife’s. His hard work has resulted in the increase in value of his 99.99% shares in the company and this has already been taken into account as his direct contribution to the asset pool. However, the Wife’s giving of assistance and support to the Husband in carrying on his business is a relevant consideration under s 112(2)(g) of the WC. This will be taken into account by way of further adjustment to the parties’ average contributions later: see _ANJ_ (at \[22\]).

210    With regard to the extent of the financial contributions made by each party to the welfare of the family, I find that the Husband’s contribution is greater than the Wife’s. As for their non-financial contributions, I find no reason to make any meaningful distinction between the contributions made by the parties. It is clear that in the course of the 10-year marriage, each of them has supported the other and looked after A in their respective way. This too, was acknowledged by the Husband, in his 22 February 2017 message to the Wife as follows:[^317]

> You said you fought hard for our marriage these 10 years. Me too … with action and proven results. We are indeed in happy family .. so please and and (_sic_) get it over. Love is forgiving…

211    The Husband provided a summary of instances to highlight the “negative influence” of the Wife on the family.[^318] While the court is not precluded from considering the conduct of the parties in exercising its power to order the division of matrimonial assets under s 112(2) of the WC, the court only ought to have regard to conduct that is both _extreme_ (i.e, manifestly serious) and _undisputed_ for the purpose of ascribing a “negative contribution”: see _Chan Tin Sun v Fong Quay Sim_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGCA 2</span> (at \[25\]). The hearing of the ancillaries is not intended to be another forum for parties to dredge up accusations and allegations relating to each other’s conduct. As noted in _TQU_ (at \[131\]), the power to divide matrimonial assets does not exist to serve a punitive function. I do not find any of the allegations made by the Husband to meet the requisite threshold for the court to ascribe a negative contribution.

212    Having considered both the financial and non-financial aspects and taking a broad-brush approach, I find that the ratio of the parties’ indirect contributions to the family is 60:40 in the Husband’s favour.

## Average Ratio

213    Applying the structured approach, the parties’ average percentage contributions as derived from the parties’ direct and indirect contributions represented in tabular form would be as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="48.84%"> <col width="25.58%"> <col width="25.58%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Husband (%)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Wife (%)</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Direct contributions</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">74</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">26</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Indirect contributions (both financial and non-financial)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">60</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">40</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Average percentage contributions</b></p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>67</b></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>33</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

214    I have considered the guidelines in _ANJ_ (at \[27\]) on the circumstances that could vary the weight assigned to direct and indirect contributions but found no reason to do so on those bases. The average ratio based on the parties’ direct and indirect contributions is thus 67:33 in favour of the Husband. However, there is a need to adjust the average ratio to take into account the giving of assistance and support by the Wife to the Husband in carrying on his business. In the final analysis, I find it just and equitable to award 62% of the assets to the Husband and 38% to the Wife.

## Mechanism on division

215    The total value of matrimonial assets that falls for division is $2,062,039.54.[^319] The Husband is entitled to 62% and Wife is entitled to 38%.[^320] In actual quantum, the Husband is entitled to $1,278,465 (rounded up) and the Wife is entitled to $783,575 (rounded down). The Wife shall retain the assets in her sole name ($299,690.44)[^321] and the Husband shall retain the assets in his sole name ($771,425.50).[^322] The Husband shall pay the Wife $483,885 ($783,575 -$299,690.44) (rounded up) being the balance of the 38% which she is entitled to and the Husband shall be entitled to retain the joint assets.[^323]

216    The precise terms to give effect to this division will be set out later. At this point, I would remind counsel of their duty to assist the court and this includes where possible, informing the judge of any clear, uncontroversial errors in his or her decision, so that the judge can correct such inadvertent errors before the decision is appealed: see _BOR v BOS and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGCA 78</span> (at \[32\]) and _TQU_ (at \[26\]). The parties should write to inform the court if they perceive any errors in computations or otherwise on the various figures stated, within one week from the date of this judgment. This judgment is to be read subject to any such correction that may arise.

## Conclusion

217    In conclusion, my orders arising out of this AM hearing are as follows:

> (a)     The parties shall have joint custody of A.

> (b)     The Wife shall have care and control of A.

> (c)     The Husband shall have liberal access to A. The Husband shall be at liberty to contact A directly and A shall be at liberty to contact the Husband directly as and when she wishes to do so.

> (d)     The Husband shall provide maintenance for A at a sum of $1,784.71 per month (including premiums for A’s insurance policies) to be paid to the Wife.[^324]

> (e)     There shall be no maintenance for the Wife.[^325]

> (f)     Within 3 months from the date of this order, the Wife shall transfer all her rights, title and interest in the matrimonial home to the Husband upon the Husband paying the Wife the sum of $483,885. The costs and expenses of the transfer shall be borne by the Husband solely. The Wife shall refund her own CPF account for all moneys utilised toward the purchase of the matrimonial home including accured interest.

> (g)     The order in sub-paragraph (f) above is made subject to the CPF Act and subsidiary legislation made thereunder. The CPF Board shall give effect to the terms of this order in accordance with the provisions of the CPF Act and subsidiary legislation made thereunder.

> (h)     Within 1 month from the date of this order, the Wife shall consent and do all things necessary to effect the closure of the parties’ Joint UOB Account and the variation of the mortgage repayment of the matrimonial home from the Joint UOB Account to an account held in the Husband’s sole name, and any balance in the Joint UOB Account shall be transferred to an account held in the Husband’s name.

> (i)     Each party shall retain all other assets in their own respective names.

> (j)     The Registrar of the Family Justice Courts, under s 31 of the Family Justice Act, shall be empowered to execute, sign or endorse all necessary documents relating to matters contained in this order on behalf of the Wife, if the Wife fails to do so within 7 days of the written request being made to her.

> (k)     There shall be liberty to apply.

218    In making the above orders, I have assumed that the Wife has not made any further payment from her CPF account towards the mortgage loan after the last instalment in July 2018.[^326] If there are payments made by the Wife through her CPF account after July 2018, the Husband shall, in addition to paying the Wife the sum $483,885 (being her 38% share of the matrimonial assets), refund to the Wife the moneys withdrawn from her CPF account with accrued interest for payments made towards the mortgage loan after July 2018.

219    I would encourage parties to agree on the issue of costs. If there is no agreement, they are to file and exchange submissions on the issue of costs within 2 weeks from the date of this judgment.
