care and control; maintenance for child and costs

31 August 2020

### District Judge Jen Koh:

## Introduction

1       The parties’ marriage was dissolved with an Interim Judgment (IJ) on 12 November 2019.

2       The parties were able to resolve the issue of joint custody of their only child, a daughter aged 3 years old as at July 2020 (‘Child A’) and they also recorded a consent order on 2 January 2020 with regard the division of matrimonial assets and spousal maintenance.

3       The issues for determination before me pertain to the care and control of Child A, consequential orders of access and the maintenance payable for the child.

4       I made orders with regard these contested issues on 13 July 2020 and gave costs orders on 16 July 2020. The wife appealed these orders and I now set out the reasons for my decision.

## Facts

### The parties

5       The parties are Singaporeans and both aged 39 years old. The husband is a Private Banker and the wife a Relationship Manager. The parties work in different financial institutions.

6       The marriage was registered on 8 August 2015. Child A was born in July 2017 and is currently 3 years old. The parties resided in their matrimonial home, a Housing and Development Board flat in Thomson Road until the commencement of proceedings.

### Background to the dispute

7       The husband commenced divorce proceedings in August 2019. Then wife did not file a Counterclaim. Interim Judgment was granted in November 2019 on the husband’s claim relying on Section 95(3)(b) of the Women’s Charter, Cap 353. From the date of marriage to the grant of the Interim Judgment, the marriage subsisted 4 years.

8       On 2 September 2019, an interim application was filed by the husband occasioned primarily by the fact that the wife left the matrimonial home with Child A. He prayed, _inter alia_, for Child A to be returned to the matrimonial home and that neither party was to remove Child A from the matrimonial home pending the determination of the final ancillary matters. On 7 November 2019, I made interim orders granting the parties shared care and control of Child A.

9       The wife appealed the interim orders[^1] but subsequently withdrew the appeal as she said she wanted to focus on the final orders for the ancillary matters.

### Ancillary Matters – orders made 13 and 16 July 2020

10     I dealt with the ancillary matters and gave orders on the contested issues of care and control of Child A, access and maintenance for Child A on 13 July 2020. After hearing the parties and considering their affidavits and submissions, I ordered the shared care and control to continue with specific terms of contact for special occasions – Chinese New Year and birthdays. As for Child A’s maintenance, each party is to bear her expenses as and when the child is with them. Both parties have agreed to bear her major expenses equally and I provided for that. Additionally, the husband shall continue to pay Child A’s school fees from the Child Development Account (CDA) and if this becomes inadequate, this is to be shared equally.

11     On 16 July 2020, I heard the parties on the issue of costs. I awarded costs to the husband as the wife’s position on sole care and control was immoderate given the facts of the case.

## Issues to be determined

12     The issues that I therefore had to determine were:

> (1)     Sole care and control _vis a vis_ shared care and control and consequential terms of access;

> (2)     Maintenance for the child, and

> (3)     Costs of the proceedings.

## ISSUE NO. (1): CARE AND CONTROL

### The parties’ cases

#### The wife’s case

13     This wife sought an order for sole care and control and access to the husband during the day with no overnight access. As for maintenance, she assessed Child A’s expenses to be in the region of $3,330 per month (rounded off)[^2] and she sought a monthly contribution of half that amount less certain expenses that she conceded may be unnecessary and this translated to $1,200 to $1,400 monthly maintenance to be paid by the husband.

#### The wife’s case for sole care and control

14     Her case for sole care and control is summarized below:

> (a)     The wife seeks an order for sole care and control with day access to the husband until Child A attains the age of 5[^3]. She takes the view that overnight and extended access to the husband should be graduated and incremental in nature.

> (b)     In support of her claim, she has raised issues with the husband’s care of Child A whilst underlining her strong committed care and caregiving support. She submitted that she has been caring for Child A since her birth; that she breastfed the child even when sleep deprived; maintained a ‘milklog’ and ‘pooplog’ to monitor the child[^4]; prioritised Child A over her social life; organized playdates[^5]; ensured the child’s financial security with the purchase of insurance policies[^6] and that she has the stronger support system[^7]

> (c)     The wife raised several issues with the husband’s care of Child A under the interim orders. She submitted the husband was apathetic in his care of her and in the course of his care, Child A sustained diaper rash on 17 November 2019[^8]. She said that the husband did not even know the brand of diaper used by Child A[^9].

> (d)     She referred to a lack of concern on his part when it came to Child A being potty trained and that she had caught him out in merely paying lip service when she saw that A was wearing diaper on one occasion[^10].

> (e)     She submitted that the husband was not an active caregiver; that he was dependent on the helper with whom Child A slept with[^11].

> (f)     She said that the husband purchased an electric toothbrush for Child A when it was not suitable at her age[^12].

> (g)     She submitted that the husband had been caught in his lies about taking Child A to the dentist when it was actually for the helper. The husband had claimed that he brought Child A to a dental check-up. When the wife probed into the matter, it transpired that the dental check-up was for the helper[^13].

> (h)     She said that he did not know how to pack Child A’s bag (as in what had to be packed) and that he did not know A‘s diet eg discovery by the wife of whole corn kernels in Child A’s stool. When she confronted him, he produced internet links stating that it was normal for some amount of fibres in the corn kernel shells to remain undigested. The wife submitted that he was unconcerned about the issue and that he should have crushed and diced the corn before feeding them to Child A[^14]

> (i)     He did not consider Child A’s welfare when informing her that she would have a ‘new mama’[^15].

> (j)     The wife said that the husband did not prioritise Child A over his own outings and interests and that he would go out regularly to consume alcohol. She set out his credit card statements showing his spending and hence pattern of outings and drinking. This evidenced the lack of time he had for Child A as a result[^16].

> (k)     She submitted that he has anxiety issues[^17] and anger management issues.

> (l)     She submitted that there was a preponderance of evidence that favoured the inference that the husband does not have the ability or capacity to look after Child A. On the other hand, she has shown that she is a committed parent eg in her many WhatsApp messages to check on Child A; in her communications with the helper and the grandparents and that she has the better support system. She said she has hardly left Child A alone at night and that considering Child A’s tender age, Child A would need her mother’s incomparable and unflinching care and attention.

15     Given the evidence that she has produced, the wife submitted that the husband should not be granted shared care and control as he did not devote himself to Child A in the way she does. For these reasons, she was of the view that overnight access was unwarranted as he could not care for the child and did not care for the child.

16     If the court did not agree with her application for sole care, she asked for a revision of the interim orders as to some timings and for Chinese New Year contact time to be provided[^18].

#### Her case for the child’s maintenance

17     On the issue of financial provision for Child A, she submitted that the husband’s expenses on Child A were exaggerated and that he exaggerated when he said that he was the main contributor towards Child A’s expenses. The wife said that she purchased items for Child A online and that she frequently paid for Child A’s essentials including clothes and shoes.

18     Based on the parties’ Notices of Assessments, she said their monthly incomes were $16,946 (the husband)[^19] and $18,392 (the wife)[^20]. She assessed the child’s monthly expenses to be in the region of $3,300[^21] and she submitted that the expenses should be divided equally with the husband paying to her a sum of $1,200 to $1,400 as monthly maintenance for Child A.

#### The husband’s case

#### On the issue of care and control

19     The husband asked for shared care and control in the manner encapsulated in the interim order as it is in the child’s best interests and that the order would most accurately the caregiving arrangements that Child A is accustomed to.

20     His case for shared care and control is summarized below:

> (a)     The husband submitted that he was and is a competent and involved father and that he plays a role in Child A’s daily care. He detailed her care from infancy and set out his routine with her. He denied the wife’s allegations of his being ‘blithe’ about a cough that Child A had; that he was invested in ensuring that the child was toilet trained; that he was concerned about her health and had cared for her when she was sick; arranged medical and dental appointments and given her medication when she needed it[^22].

> (b)     In replying to the wife’s allegations against him, he submitted that the reference to his credit card bills and spending at pubs or drinking holes were in places near his office and in any event, they had no bearing on his care of Child A as the wife did not co-relate these outings to the days in which Child A was in his care. If he had to go out to meet a client, he did so only after settling the child for the night or when the child was asleep. He ensured that his personal activities were never at Child A’s expense[^23].

> (c)     He denied that he told Child A that she has a ‘new mother’. He submitted that the wife would conjecture on his alleged infidelities although there was no evidence of this and she took a position that he should not be entitled to Child A because of his alleged unfaithfulness to her (the wife)[^24]

> (d)     He denied having anxiety issues or anger management issues and averred that these allegations were not true or supported[^25].

> (e)     He submitted that he paid the bulk of A’s expenses and he also purchased insurance policies for Child A despite the wife’s allegations otherwise[^26].

> (f)     He said that he has a viable care plan for the child; that the wife was overly reliant on her support system of her mother[^27] and that the wife’s exhibits of her WhatsApp messages with her mother did not translate to her contributions as a mother.

> (g)     He raised an issue of how the wife would alienate Child A from him if granted sole care and this is evident from her submissions of his terms of access; that she believed he has no right to Child A because he was only a sperm donor and that he could not have time with Child A because he no longer loved the wife[^28].

> (h)     He submitted that the interim order showed that parties communicated and worked together and that there was nothing significant that had happened to show otherwise to the extent that the court should deviate from the interim order as it was working well. The examples raised by the wife on the alleged problems were not drastic eg allegation that Child A was wearing a diaper when she made it clear that Child A had to be potty-trained; that he should not use an electric toothbrush on Child A and that he did not know the brand of her diaper.

21     He asked for the interim orders to be made final with further adjustments on special occasions eg public holidays, Chinese New Year access and on birthdays.

#### His case for child maintenance

22     The husband submits that Child A’s expenses be paid by the party she is with at the material time. For major expenses, he submits that these should be borne equally between the parties including: school fees, school related expenses, enrichment or extra-curricular activities both parties have agreed upon. Notwithstanding that he submits his income to be 39% and the wife’s 61%[^29], he agrees to bear these major expenses equally with the wife.

## Court’s decision on the issue of care and control

#### Joint custody agreed

23     The parties have agreed on joint custody of Child A. This is sensible and reflects the intention that they both have in wanting to co-parent with regards to the child.

24     In _AZZ v BAA_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 44</span>, Coomaraswamy J set out 8 principles regarding custody gleaned from _CX v CY_ (minor: custody and access) \[2005\] 3 SLR (R) 690. I do not propose to go into the principles as they are entrenched principles. I would however highlight what I consider to be a few significant ones for the purpose of this case:

> a.     That the law of custody applies the welfare principles by recognizing and supporting the twin concepts of joint parental responsibility and of life-long parental responsibility.

> b.     The fear that parties may not be able to agree and co-operate in making decisions on the upbringing of the child after the divorce is not by itself a good enough reason for the making of a sole custody order. A note here: The parties herein may not think this is relevant as they have agreed to a joint custody order but I will explain further in this decision the significance I place on this point.

> c.     That it is wrong to infer that parties who share a genuine love and concern for the child will be unable to co-operate after the divorce. Allowance must be made for the stress caused by the breakdown of the marriage but once the source of stress ceases, the acrimony will also subside and as such, attaching too much weight to the acrimony leading to the onset of a custody dispute may lead to these parties increasing the acrimony as a result. Again, I will elaborate on the significance I place on this point later in my decision.

25     Hence, the starting point for these parties is that they _can_ co-operate and that they _can_ co-parent. They demonstrate this with a consented joint custody order.

#### Sole care v shared care

26     We then turn to the crux of the issues before me: sole care v shared care of the child.

27     In determining the issue of care and control, the paramount consideration is the welfare of the child. Whilst the definition of welfare is widely ascribed to issues of custody, the same test applies when it comes to the issues of care and control.

28     There have been significant decisions explaining or illustrating what the welfare of the child means. In _Soon Peck Wah v Woon Che Chye_ \[1991\] 3 SLR (R) 430 the Court of Appeal adopted an English academic (Rayden and Jackson on Divorce and Family Matters) description of “welfare of the child”:

> “The word ‘welfare’ must be taken in its widest sense. It has been said that the welfare of the child is not to be measured by money only nor by physical comfort only; the moral and religious welfare of the child must be considered as well as his physical well-being; nor can the ties of affection be disregarded. The rights and wishes of parents must be assessed and weighed in their bearing on the welfare of the child in conjunction with all other factors relative to that issue. The question for the judge is not what the essential justice of the case requires but what the best interests of the child requires.

> The welfare of the child should, therefore, be understood in the widest sense. It is not to be measured in money or physical comfort alone. The child’s moral and religious well-being as well as ties of affection must also be considered together with his or her physical well-being. The rights and wishes of the parents can also be considered in conjunction with the child’s needs.”

29     In making my decision, I considered the welfare principle and relate them to some issues raised by the parties such as issues of caregiving through the respective support system, the parties’ work schedules and caregiving, provision of physical comfort, the wife’s submission of maternal bond, the husband’s submission of the continuation of the status quo from the interim orders and the husband’s allegation of the wife causing a potential alienation of the child if she is vested sole care.

30     I also considered Section 138 of the Women’s Charter, Cap 353 (the WC) to determine if, on the facts presented by the parties, there was such a material change in circumstances warranting a change to the interim orders of shared care and control.

#### The support system

31     On a broad level, both parties work fulltime and are largely dependent on assistance from their respective families. There is nothing untoward about that and I disagreed with a submission that one set of grandparents is better than another or that one set started earlier in caring for Child A and the other set is therefore the ‘weaker’ caregiver support. The parties worked and enjoyed a dual-income and a certain lifestyle when they were together. Because of their jobs, they have always relied on grandparenting support.

32     I see that both sets of grandmothers are invested in the care of Child A and I decline to draw a comparison on the provision of care and/or the quality of care. It may well be that the wife prefers her mother as a caregiver and there is nothing wrong with that. It does not mean however, that the husband’s support system through his mother is therefore deficient. The allegation that the husband’s mother only learned to feed Child A at a later stage was therefore not significant in the greater context of what is in this child’s welfare. In any event, there is also the presence of the helper whom both parties rely on. Addressing the wife’s concern specifically on this, Child A is old enough to eat on her own or will be, in a matter of time.

33     Comparisons of this sort do not assist the parties in moving forward and letting go of the past. They are reliant on their support system and as I said, the standards that the wife applies to the child’s care does not necessarily mean that the husband’s support system is lacking or deficient. Viewed holistically, the child is healthy and there is no issue with the caregiving.

#### Parties’ caregiving and provision of physical comfort

34     I did not find that one parent was ‘better’ than the other in the care of Child A. They may have different parenting styles but it does not mean that one is less able to care for A as a result. The wife’s submission seems to be premised on how much time she invests in Child A compared to the husband – comparing his social life and activities, showing her WhatsApp messages and her constant checks on Child A etc. Whilst the husband may not text his mother as frequently, I do not see that the husband is a parent who is uninvolved or lacking as a parent.

35     The wife has raised the diaper rash, the lack of knowledge of Child A’s brand of diaper and ‘catching’ him allowing Child A to be in diapers when they had both committed to ‘potty-training’. It was also unfortunate that parties descended into more affidavits and allegations about a dental visit and whether it was for the child or the helper with the wife making a case that the husband did not actually bring the child but the helper for a dental check-up.

36     These incidents do not translate to incidents showing that the husband has no regard for Child A’s welfare. They are one-off incidents and seemed to have been raised for the purpose of this hearing. I refer to paragraph 24(c) above. It may well be that the acrimony is ‘levelled up’ for purposes of the ancillary matters hearing but these incidents do not show neglect of Child A or danger to Child A.

37     I also refer to paragraph 24(b) above. These reasons raised by the wife were not compelling enough for the wife to insist on a sole custody order. I therefore do not think that they were the more compelling when it comes to an issue of sole care and control when parties can agree to co-parent on a larger level or major issues involving the child.

38     Both parties are doing their respective parts in providing for Child A and they both earn an adequate income such that there is no issue with the provision of physical comfort for her.

#### Maternal bond

39     The wife relies on the maternal bond as a submission that she is to be awarded sole care and control of the child. Whilst the courts do consider the maternal bond, there is no presumption of this in favour of mothers nor a generalization that young children are generally placed in the care of their mothers. The courts have awarded care and control of young children to fathers as well as mothers (see eg _Tan Siew Kee v Chua Ah Boey_ \[1987\] SLR (R) 725 where care and control of an infant boy was given to a father). The facts of each individual case and the circumstances of each case are relevant for the court in making a determination and the maternal bond is a consideration; not _the_ consideration.

#### Possibility of alienation

40     I do not agree that there is evidence of this on the wife’s part. The husband’s fears are founded on the wife’s submission of a reduction of access terms and contact with Child A if the wife was granted sole care and control.

41     I make mention of one point here. When the parties were together, the wife did leave the home on a few occasions[^30] with Child A. The wife pointed out that each time she left and stayed out, the husband did not have issue with contact with Child A.

42     I agreed with the wife on this point and note that she did not obstruct contact with the child. The husband will have the weight of a court order; hence he should not be concerned that there could possibly be an issue with alienation, merely on the wife’s submission on access terms if she is given sole care and control.

#### Section 128 of the Women’s Charter, Cap 353

43     Since November 2019, the parties shared care and control of Child A. Looking at the incidents raised by the wife, I am of the view that they are not material enough to warrant a change in the circumstances. The wife may see herself as the more committed parent but when it comes to the welfare of the child, the welfare is perceived from the child’s viewpoint and it is in every child’s best interests to have both parents in its life. The fact that a common household is not possible with the dissolution of the marriage does not translate to a loss of a common parental relationship.

44     It is my view that the exposure with regularity to this parental relationship is important for this particular child as she needs to have a balance of both a maternal and a paternal relationship. This will not be possible with the limitations set by the wife as to contact time. In order for this exposure to be achieved at this young age, she can spend the time as carved out with both sets of parents.

45     In this case, there is also no material change in the circumstances that would compel a change. The wife may hold to a different standard of parenting when compared to the husband and this is not a bad thing. It does not however make him the ‘worse’ parent; but a _different_ parent. In my view, this balancing of the exposure to both parents with regularity will assist the child to have a more balanced childhood. As both parents love Child A, they should be allowed to love her in their individual way; I am satisfied that her welfare is not compromised by this and therefore ordered the shared order to continue.

#### Orders for shared and control and adjustments on special occasion

46     I therefore retained the orders made on 7 November 2019. The wife has asked for a change in return time on Wednesday but I see no cogent reasons for this to be varied.

47     As for the public holiday access requested by the husband, I am not granting this order as the parties are already sharing the week and as such the public holidays will fall on either party’s share of the week.

48     I will however vary the interim orders to include 2 and a half hours to the parent who does not have Child A with him or her during her birthday and the respective party’s birthday and if the parties are unable to agree on the time, then it shall be 6.00 pm to 8.30 pm.

49     Additionally, Chinese New Year shall form the exception and be taken in priority of the parties’ share of the week with alternating reunion dinner with second day and first day of Chinese New Year accordingly.

## ISSUE NO. (2): MAINTENANCE FOR THE CHILD

50     Affordability is not an issue for these parties when it comes to financial provision for their only child. The incomes are not very disparate with the wife earning slightly more than the husband.

#### The wife’s position

51     Their expense lists for the child did vary but the wife sensibly agreed to take out expenses for holidays in view of the current Covid19 climate; expenses for insurance premiums and maintenance of air-conditioners. As for the expenses by the wife for the child which the husband said was excessive such as: $600 per month for groceries and food and diapers and $400 per month for entertainment/hobbies/diapers, the wife left the quantum to court to decide.

52     From the list of expenses, she agreed to share equally with the husband. She proposed a sum of $1,200 to $1,400 per month as a contribution by the husband to be paid to her as maintenance for the child.

#### The husband’s position

53     The husband submits that the parties maintain the child when the child in their respective care and for major expenses to be shared equally.

## Court’s decision on the issue of maintenance

54     In view of the orders that I had made with regard to shared care and control, the parties are to pay for the child’s day to day expenses when the child is with them and under their care.

55     The husband has been managing the child’s school fees from her Child Development Account and he shall continue to arrange for payment of the child’s school fees from this account. If the funds are depleted, then the parties are to share the expense equally.

56     As parties’ incomes are not very disparate, I also ordered the parties are to contribute equally to the child’s major expenses including hospitalization and medical expenses other than expenses incurred at a General Practitioner; education expenses other than school fees for which both parties have agreed upon and any other expenses the parties have agreed on before the incurring of the expense. If there is no agreement as to the item of expense, the disagreeing party shall not be responsible for the same.

57     Parties are to pay for the respective premiums of insurance policies they have bought of their own accord for the child. If the insurance policy is a joint decision, then parties are to share the payment of premiums equally.

## ISSUE NO. 3: COSTS OF THE PROCEEDINGS – DIVORCE AND ANCILLARY MATTERS

#### Issue to be determined

58     The divorce writ was settled on an uncontested basis. The issue of costs of the divorce was adjourned to be heard in chambers. I also had to deal with the issue of costs of the ancillary matters.

59     The parties filed 19 affidavits in these proceedings. The focus was on 5 affidavits for the husband and 4 for the wife for the ancillary matters. Both parties filed Written Submissions and Bundles of Authorities. The parties appeared before me for a half day hearing for the ancillary maters and another short attendance on costs.

#### The husband’s case for costs

60     The husband asked for costs of $6,000 inclusive disbursements which were in the region of $2,340. He premised his submission on costs on the fact that the husband succeeded in the amount of time that each party gets to spend with child and on the overnight access issues. On the maintenance issue, although both agreed that the child’s expenses were to be shared equally but the wife asked for 50% of $3,500 and $1,750 to be paid to her although at the hearing, she submitted an amount of $1,200 - $1,400 per month. The husband said that the wife failed in her positions and that he succeeded on his claims.

61     Additionally, notwithstanding the fact that the wife was directed not to refer to a report she had obtained for the purposes of care and control and the offending paragraphs and exbibits struck out, the wife ignored the orders and re-included these offending matters in her 2nd ancillary matters affidavit. Apart from having to strike out these matters again, new evidence of audio recording without any certified transcripts were also produced in contravention of the rules. The husband asked for an additional $1,500 as costs thrown away for the additional work.

62     The husband submitted that even if it is a family case, it is not always mean no orders as to costs just because there are child issues. He urged the court to consider how the parties conducted the proceedings.

#### The wife’s case for costs

63     The wife submitted that costs orders were discretionary in nature. She said this was an appropriate case to depart from the concept of costs following the event. She said hers was not a hopeless case and she did not misconduct herself. She submitted that costs orders would increase acrimony.

64     On the other hand, she submitted that the husband had concealed evidence with redaction of financial statements which he was then ordered him to re-file and this amounted to 544 pages of concealment by him.

65     As for striking out, she submitted that the appropriate penalties have been imposed on the wife because she had to pay over $500 for the re-filing of D2AM. The husband should not benefit as a result.

## Court’s decision on the issue of costs

66     It is not correct to say that the court does not orders for family cases. The general rule is costs follows the event; however, it is also a pertinent point that there have been decisions where the courts have been concerned about costs awards increasing acrimony; the age old adage that there are no winners in a divorce and the concern that as parties continue in a familial setting and continue to deal with each other, the court should therefore be slow in awarding costs in this setting.

67     I have no doubt that costs is a sensitive issue. However, I raise 2 pertinent points to explain my costs orders:

> (a)     The wife disregarded an order not to include the report which was struck out. The fact that she had to re-file and incurred fees could not be considered a penalty already suffered by her; she should not have disregarded the order in the first place.

> (b)     A significant portion of the affidavit evidence and submissions was incurred on the issue of care and control _vis a vis_ the financial issues. In the final orders, the interim orders were continued and the husband was already granted shared care and control but the wife’s position in the ancillary matters was not satisfactory. The husband did succeed on his position and claims.

68     Taking into account all the matters, I was minded to award some costs to the husband in view of the facts of the case inclusive the divorce which was granted on her behaviour. I fixed costs at $3,000 to the husband with the stamp fees and service fees limited to the 2 ancillary matters affidavits for the entire divorce proceedings.
