Maintenance for Child above 21 – Section 69(5) Women’s Charter

26 July 2019

### District Judge Jinny Tan:

## Introduction

1       The Applicant (“the Son”) filed this application against his father (“the Father”) for maintenance.

2       At the time of application, the Son was 22 years old.

3       The Son filed this application against the Father in June 2018, for maintenance which would mainly be for his education overseas. He sought for a lump sum maintenance which comprised of the following: -

> a)     Tuition fees for 2 years of Preparatory Programme in Columbia College;

> b)     Expenses for his 2 years while he attended the Preparatory Programme;

> c)     Tuition fees for 2 years for his university fees for him to obtain a Bachelor of Arts in the University of Alberta; and

> d)     Expenses for his 2 years while he attended university to obtain a Bachelor of Arts.

## Orders made

The Son is to inform the Father 1 month in advance the cost of the airfare and the Father is to make payment within 2 weeks thereafter.

## Appeal

5       The Father has since filed an appeal against the whole of my decision and I now furnish my full grounds of decision.

## Background

6       The Son was born in 1996, and was 22 years old at the time of the application.

7       His mother (“the Mother”) is 54 years old[^1]. The Mother and the Father obtained a divorce in October 2004, and the Son is the only child to the marriage. As part of the divorce, it was agreed between the Father and his ex-Wife that the Father shall pay no maintenance towards the Son’s maintenance. At the time of the divorce the Son was 8 years old.

8       The Father had since remarried and has two sons. On the other hand, the Mother remained single, and maintained the Son without any contribution from the Father.

9       The Son completed his “O” Level examinations in 2014. In 2015, he enrolled in the Diploma of IT Service Management in Republic Polytechnic. He graduated in 2018 with a diploma, with a grade point average (“GPA”) of 1.82/4.00.

## The Son’s Case

10     With his diploma results, the Son realised that it was not good enough for him to seek employment, and he decided to pursue a degree in Journalism (which he always had a passion for)[^2].

11     He then made enquiries with various local universities on their admission requirements for a local undergraduate journalism programme, but was informed that with his Diploma results, he was not able to qualify for a direct admission[^3].

12     He then considered various universities in the United Kingdom (“UK”), Australia and Canada which had established Journalism programmes. He was also informed that he had to take a foundation programme as he did not have a background in Journalism and did not have a strong GPA which allowed him a direct entry into the undergraduate programme[^4].

13     After comparing the various options, he then decided to go to Canada, to first undergo the preparatory programme at Columbia College and then, thereafter, to gain entry into University of Alberta to do a Bachelor of Arts in Comparative Literature[^5].

14     He informed the Father of his decision and the Father agreed to pay for the overseas education but requested that the full particulars of the course including the fees be sent to him[^6].

15     On 22 June 2018, the Son received the Letter of Acceptance from Columbia College for the preparatory programme. He then forwarded it to the Father, and informed him of the fees and related expenses for his accommodation and travel.

16     The Father then asked for a copy of the Son’s NRIC and Diploma certificate. The Son enquired about the reason for such request, and thereafter the Father remained uncontactable.

17     The Son therefore missed the September 2018 intake.

18     The Son therefore filed this application to seek maintenance from the Father, so that he would be able to further his education in Canada in journalism.

## The Father’s Case

19     The Father was not represented in the proceedings. His case changed as the proceedings progressed.

20     In the written summary given by him to the Court, his position was that when the Son informed him about his wish to go for a preparatory course, he requested for a copy of the NRIC and Polytechnic certificate so that he could get a loan from the bank. However, the Son refused to provide the documents, and moreover, the bank officer informed him that he did not meet the criteria of obtaining a loan because of his income[^7].

21     During the course of the trial, when the Father was cross examining the Son, from his questions, the Father’s case appeared to be that he was doubtful that the Son would do well in his education overseas since academically, he was not doing well in Singapore.

> _Q:_ _Actual reason is, you’re doing so bad in Singapore, what makes you think that going overseas you can do well?[^8]_

22     Thereafter, the Father’s case changed, and his case was that the Son was going overseas not for his education, but for some other purpose. He also alluded to an earlier meeting in 2015, when the Son had spoken to him about wanting to go overseas. He was very adamant in his belief that the Son’s motive for going overseas was not for his education but for his own other agenda.

> _Q:_ _Okay, uh, Mr \[UYU\], uh, during 2015, you came and saw me somewhere around Marina Bay Sands, the first meeting, did you tell me, you don’t like to stay in this “bloody Singapore”. Yes or no?[^9]_

> ………

> _Q:_ _… Okay, number 2, when I asked him, “Why not finish your NS before going overseas, all that?” He say, he don’t like to go to National Service.[^10]_

> ….

> _R:_ _Because, my few questions, what I learnt from him that he wants to leave this country because at the age of 8 years old, he found himself that he prefers to, uh, he prefer men than woman. He told me all this story, that’s the reason I focus, I found out that, why you want to run away from this country…..[^11]_

> ….

> _If I have the money, if I pay him, he’s going to run away from this country, and – it’s not for the studies. It’s for his own benefit, which is very unfair. That’s the reason I’m pressing him, study in Singapore, get better marks. Can re-apply to, okay, university again.[^12]”_

## The Law

23     Section 69(2) of the Women’s Charter provides that: -

> “The Court may, on due proof that a parent has neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for his child who is unable to maintain himself, order that parent to pay a monthly allowance or a lump sum for the maintenance of that child.”

24     As the Son is above 21 years old, the relevant provision to be considered is Section 69(5) of the Women’s Charter, which states that: -

> “The Court shall not make an order under subsection (2) for the benefit of a child who has attained the age of 21 years or for a period that extends beyond the day on which the child will attain that age unless the Court is satisfied that the provision of the maintenance is necessary because: -

>> a)    Of a mental or physical disability of the child;

>> b)    The child is or will be serving full-time national service;

>> c)    The child is or will be or (if an order were made under subsection (2)) would be receiving instruction at an educational establishment or undergoing training for a trade, profession or vocation, whether or not while in gainful employment;

>> d)    Or special circumstances, other than those stated in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c), exist which justify the making of the order.

25     The applicable provision which the Son is relying on is subsection (c) of Section 69(5).

## My Findings

### Is Maintenance necessary?

26     The Court of Appeal in _BON and others v. BOQ[^13]_, considered, amongst other things, the duty of parents to maintain their children above 21 years old. It was held that parents have a duty to maintain their children and this includes children above 21 that are receiving instruction at an educational establishment, and the court has a discretion in determining where the duty ends.

> _“Whether to grant maintenance for children seeking education depends on the circumstances, such as whether the child was genuinely pursuing a course of studies to prepare themselves for university.”_

27     In the case of _BON_, the Court of Appeal found that the children had given evidence that they believe that a university degree would improve their prospects and give them a higher earning capacity. Both were pursuing courses to improve their employability in the workforce and not for self-improvement, and they were not in pursuit of multiple university degrees. The Court of Appeal therefore found that it was a reasonable position, and the children did not display a cavalier attitude towards the pursuit of their further studies and found that both parents were responsible for financing their education.

28     Here, I found that the Son genuinely wanted to improve his employability in the workforce. He did not do well in polytechnic and with his grade, it would affect his employability. He therefore hoped to further his education in a course which was of interest to him.

29     It was his evidence that he tried to apply to the local universities but he was not able to gain admission due to his grades in polytechnic.

30     The Son also gave evidence that he approached several banks to see if he was able to take up a loan to fund his own education. His evidence is that he was not able to get a loan[^14].

31     He was also not able to work and save up for his own education, because he had just graduated, and it would be difficult for him to earn enough to cover the cost of the university education[^15].

32     He did his research on the various options and finally decided upon the preparatory programme at Columbia College which would then allow him entry into the 3rd year of the Bachelor of Arts in Comparative Literature programme offered by the University of Alberta. He applied for it, and received the letter of acceptance in June 2018[^16].

33     The Son also had the expectation that the Father would pay for his overseas education. This was because the Father had given financial support to his two stepsons for their overseas education, and also there were earlier discussions between them (before the Son did his diploma in the polytechnic) wherein he communicated his interest to study overseas and the Father did not indicate his inability or refusal to assist financially for it[^17].

34     Even after his polytechnic, the Son also communicated the fees on the overseas education to the Father, and the Father did not indicate his inability or refusal to assist financially[^18].

35     Based on the above, I found that the Son was entitled to seek maintenance on the basis that he would be receiving instruction at an educational establishment.

36     However, while the Son is entitled to seek maintenance, he took an unreasonable stance by seeking an order for the Father to be solely responsible for maintaining him.

37     It is the duty of both parents to maintain or contribute towards the maintenance of their children[^19]. It is therefore not just the Father’s sole duty.

### Was there refusal or neglect on the Father’s part?

38     The next issue which the Court had to determine is whether the Father has neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance to the Son, or whether it is a case where the Father simply cannot afford it financially.

39     In the written statement to Court, the Father cited financial reasons for his inability to pay for the Son’s education. In the examination in chief, the Father also stated that he was not able to afford.

40     However, during the cross examination, the Father admitted that he was able to find the means to pay for the Son’s education, and that he did not wish to pay for the Son’s education overseas.

> _Q:_ _Okay, Mr \[UYT\], let me ask you. If you had supported your stepsons financially, don’t you think it’s also your obligation to now support your biological son?_

> _A:_ _Definitely, I’d like to. But after the mediation \[sicc\] with Mr \[Z\], yah, the first one, I was very, very angry when he used the word, “I ambush him when I met that few times. He told that with – to Mr \[Z\] also, but \[Z\] – Mr \[Z\] explained to him, don’t – don’t use the word “Ambush” …_

> _Q:_ _Okay, so you agree that’s – you s—you said that you would like to provide for him because he is your son, right? You – I mean, you just said that a second ago that you would – you would like to provide for him, right?_

> _A:_ _Uh, some – some means uh –_

> _Q:_ _Okay_

> _A:_ _to get –_

> _Q:_ _some means._

> _A:_ _tac—to talk to my Wife, my friends and to help him up, because he is his studies_ [^20]

> _…._

> _A:_ _Okay, uh, I think I earlier said already. I would have helped but af—he brought me to the Court which upset me and my Wife. Number 2, he was totally a different guy, when he at—when he at the mediation with Mr \[Z\], the first one with \[Z\]. I saw his colour and very, very bad, like use words like “I ambushed him”, you know? He’s not grateful at all…_

> _Disagree to help him, lah. And then, his motive, I already know because he told me in the – previously, uh, meeting outside that at the age of 8, he prefer men[^21]._

> …..

> _Q:_ _I put it to you that your statement at Paragraph 7, that you cannot afford to pay for \[UYU\] tertiary education is false. Do you agree or disagree?_

> _A:_ _Hmm, uh, can I explain little bit? Just – because my Wife is earning, uh, a good amount, lah, so she would help me, definitely. But after the thing, she also don’t like it already when – when I was called to go to Court all that. Uh, she’s, uh, well-to-do. …_

> …

> _Q:_ _Okay. And I put it to you that your statement at paragraph 7 is fabricated merely to deny your son the opportunity to study overseas, do you agree or disagree?_

> _A:_ _Um, uh, I agreed – I don’t want him to go overseas, I don’t want to pay. I agreed that one_ [^22] .

41     The reason for his refusal to contribute towards the Son’s maintenance was because he felt that the Son had an ulterior motive for going overseas, and it was not to further his education. This was stated by the Father during the trial.

> _“Exp—explain, is this, uh, if I’m not wrong, the same thing, lah. The meeting we had outside, I and him, what he told me, I’m telling but he’s disagree. Then I know his motive, and he also don’t want to go army. So, from his talk I – I know, he wants to run away from this, he uses word “bloody Singapore”. Uh, I know his motive. Why not – okay, his qualification is, uh, not very good. Okay, go back and study again, sec – when I see the Pre-U all that, the Wife – the Mother said cannot repeat. “Okay, Sec 4 can repeat what, study better, get better marks and then stay in Singapore and you know, come up yourself and there – he’s, uh – what? 22 years old, I mean, you can also work, then do night study, you know something like that lah._

> _…._

> _Not uh getting out of this Singapore and, uh – he likes men, okay, oh cannot – cannot, lah, not fair, lah, going other country. Not – that means you’re going there not to study also, you’re going there to – for your own enjoyment with other people money. This is very unfair, I feel and my family also felt it.”_ [^23]

42     The Father, during his cross examination of the Son, also appeared to focus on the fact that the Son did not have the intention of furthering his studies, but rather, going overseas was a way to “escape” from Singapore[^24].

43     Even during the cross examination of his ex-Wife, the Father’s case was that the Son wanted to “escape” from Singapore.

> _Q:_ _Okay, uh, from your son, uh, few years back, I heard that, you are in love with a white man and wanted to marry him…._

> _…. That was one way you – was, uh, hopefully, she and the man can get along, go over, so that he also can follow, to escape from this country, but he told me, the white man want her but do not want him to come over.”[^25]_

44     I note that there was also an email from the Son to the Father, informing him of the costs[^26]. The Son wrote: -

> _“Hi, as requested the payment breakdown is listed below together with my letter of acceptance & fees payable directly to the university.”_

45     If the Father was not in a position to assist financially, such an email would not be sent in the first place. The fact that the Son had sent him such an email, showed that there was some representation made to the Son that the Father would assist financially. The email was sent pursuant to a request made by the Father regarding the payments to be made.

46     Based on the above, I found that the Father had refused to contribute to the Son’s maintenance, and that it was not because of his financial inability. He refused because he was in principle not agreeable to the idea of the Son using his money, to go overseas to lead a lifestyle which he disapproves of.

### What is a reasonable amount of maintenance to be paid?

47     I next had to determine what is a reasonable amount of maintenance to be paid by the Father to the Son.

48     The Son listed the amounts he required[^27]. His counsel at the trial, amended some of the figures, namely, the other related expenses for his 3rd year should be $16,782 instead of $19,701 and for the 4th year, it should be $16,782 instead of $19,701.

49     There is no dispute by the Father in relation to these amounts. No questions were asked; no arguments were made in relation to whether these figures were incorrect or inflated.

50     The only issue is how much the Father should contribute towards the Son’s maintenance.

51     The Father has not been very forthcoming in his declaration of income. In his monthly expenses form, he declared his income to be $1,000[^28]. He then exhibited payslips from \[C\] Logistics Pte Ltd, showing his basic income is $1,000 per month[^29].

52     Based on his IRAS Notice of Assessment for the Year of Assessment 2018, his annual income is $25,155[^30]. This is an average of about $2,000 per month.

53     There is already therefore a contradiction between his declaration of his income and his Notice of Assessment.

54     Moreover, he is not just an employee of \[C\] Logistics Pte Ltd, he is in fact the sole director and shareholder[^31] with his Wife as a secretary of the company.

55     The payslips from \[C\] Logistics Pte Ltd were all issued to him by him, as they were all stated to be “Prepared By Approved By \[UYT\]”[^32]. He even appointed himself as director of the company[^33]. He is therefore not just an employee of the company.

56     While the Father tried to give the impression that he only earns $1,000 per month, the truth is that he is in involved in several businesses[^34]. He is a director of various companies, and receives income from other companies.

57     During cross examination, he was asked about the source of his trade and employment income. He stated that for trade income of $9,153, the source is from \[E\] Express[^35].

58     \[E\] Express is a partnership belonging to the Father and his Wife, wherein he holds 20% and his Wife 80%[^36].

59     As for his employment income of $16,000, his sources are from the companies \[C\] Logistics Pte Ltd, \[F\] Global Services Pte Ltd and \[G\] International Singapore Pte Ltd[^37].

60     The Father exhibited some of the financial statements of \[C\] Logistics Pte Ltd to show that the company has not been making any profits[^38]. While the financial statements do show that the company is not doing well financially, it also shows that his Wife, who is the secretary, appears to be drawing more income from the company that the Father, who is the director and shareholder. His Wife draws an annual income of $47,000 while he draws $12,000[^39].

61     This is quite similar to how \[E\] Express is structured, wherein the Father holds a smaller stake while his Wife a bigger stake[^40].

62     Therefore, just based on the documents, it does appear that the Father earning about $2,000 per month, but he is involved in various businesses and in some of the businesses, it has been structured such that his Wife draws more money than him.

63     The Father also exhibited his various bank accounts[^41].

64     He appears to have some means based on the available balance standing in his bank accounts. As at 31 October 2018, he had $116,970.78 in his United Overseas Bank (“UOB”) Accounts[^42].

65     Moreover, he has also been able to make substantial payments to reduce his housing loan. This can be seen from his loan statements which he had given to the Court[^43]. For example, $120,000 in January 2018, $52,000 in February 2018, $27,000 in March 2018, $71,000 in April 2018.

66     The Father also admitted that he had supported his two stepsons financially in their studies. One son studied in Australia, and the other in Singapore[^44].

67     While he did say that his Wife and him financially assisted their two sons, her source of income is effectively the same source as the Father. His Wife works in \[C\] Logistics Pte Ltd which the Father is a director and sole shareholder. Moreover, based on the Father’s evidence, his Wife had other sources of income[^45].

68     I also took into consideration the fact that during the trial, he admitted that he would be able to obtain payment to fund the Son’s education, but for the fact that the Son made him angry[^46]. If he was not able to afford, he would not even have explored the possibility of assisting the Son financially.

69     From the above, I found that the Father does have some means, which he has not fully disclosed.

70     As stated above, the Father cannot be solely responsible towards the Son’s maintenance. Both parents have a duty to maintain their son. I therefore considered the Son’s Mother’s income, in order to determine how much contribution, the Father should be making towards the Son’s maintenance.

71     The Son’s Mother in her affidavit stated that she is a private tutor, earning $15,000 per annum. This works out to be about $1,250 per month[^47].

72     Based on the proportion of their income (and putting aside the fact that the Father may have other means which he did not fully disclosed), I found that the Son’s maintenance should be borne in the proportion of 60% (Father) and 40% (Mother).

73     Therefore, I ordered that the Father to contribute 60% of the various payments listed out by the Son as his tuition fees, and related expenses.

74     The Son had asked for a lump sum payment of the maintenance. I did not agree that a lump sum should be awarded to him for the following reasons: -

> a.     There are uncertainties in that, the Son may not in the end take up the preparatory course given that he will have to find the funds to pay for the rest of the 40%;

> b.     There are also uncertainties in the financial situations of his parents. The Father or his Mother may face a change in their finances circumstances which may warrant a future variation of the maintenance to be paid to the Son;

> c.     There is also uncertainty as to how well the Son adapts to overseas education, and whether he performs well in his 1st year to proceed to the 2nd year or his Bachelor of Arts;

> d.     The related expenses are estimated expenses and may increase or decrease over the next few years.
