Family Law – Custody – Access

14 December 2020

### District Judge Darryl Soh:

## Introduction

1       This matter concerns an application for interim school break, birthday, and holiday time by the Plaintiff-Wife (“the Wife”) against the Defendant-Husband (“the Husband”) (collectively referred to as “the Parties”) with respect to their daughter (“the Child”). At the hearing of 13 October 2020, I made orders to divide the time during the said events equally between the Parties. Whilst the Parties broadly agreed with the adoption of this approach, they differed in its application. The Wife appealed against part of my orders, specifically on the _scope_ of time to be divided for certain events. In these grounds, I explain my decision on the applicable orders in detail.

## Background Facts

2       The Wife and Husband are in the medical and legal profession respectively. Both are in their mid-thirties and are blessed with a four-year-old daughter. In 2018, the Parties’ relationship broke down and the Wife left the matrimonial home. The daughter remained in the care of the Husband and his parents.

3       The Wife commenced divorce proceedings on 17 December 2018 and Interim Judgment was entered about a year later, on 14 November 2019. The hearing of the ancillary matters has yet to take place. The divorce proceedings were heated at the outset, but the Parties grew to find common ground for the sake of their daughter as proceedings progressed, even when it seemed that any agreement would be hard to come by. Their marriage was a short one and it was dissolved on an uncontested basis by reason of the Husband’s counterclaim that the Wife behaved in such a way that the Husband cannot reasonably be expected to live with her.

4       Pending the hearing of the ancillary matters, the Wife filed an application for interim school break, birthday, and holiday time with their daughter. This is the latest of a series of applications filed for interim care arrangements. For the purposes of the Wife’s application, I find that it will be useful to summarise chronologically in broad[^1] terms the interim care arrangements ordered thus far:

> (a)     By order of 22 April 2019 _vide_ SUM 1183/2019, the Wife was granted interim weekday access to the Child every Monday, Tuesday and Thursday from after school to 10pm. The Wife was also granted interim weekend overnight access every Saturday 6pm to Sunday 6pm. The Parties were ordered to share equally gazetted public holidays with the Child wherein each Party is to spend alternate holidays with her.

> (b)     By order of 17 June 2019 _vide_ SUM 1830/2019 entered into by consent, the Wife was granted access to the Child during the “child care services period” from 24 June 2019, 10am to 26 June 2019, 2pm.

> (c)     By order of 3 September 2019 _vide_ SUM 4477/2018 entered into by consent, the Parties were granted interim shared care and control of the Child. By order in the same summons, the Wife was granted time with the child identical to the weekday, weekend, and gazetted public holidays schedule as per paragraph 4(a) above.

> (d)     By order of 30 October 2019 _vide_ SUM 3613/2019, the Parties were ordered to share time with the Child in the following manner during the Child’s school break:

>> (i)       The Wife was granted time with the Child from 6 December 2019 after school to 8 December 2019, 6pm, while forgoing time with the Child from 30 November 2019, 6pm to 1 December 2019, 6pm;

>> (ii)       During the period of 14 December 2019 to 1 January 2020, the Husband was granted time with the Child from 14 December 2019, 8pm to 22 December 2019, 8pm, and the Wife was granted time with the Child from 22 December 2019, 8pm to 31 December 2019; and

>> (iii)       Both Parties were granted liberty to bring the Child out of Singapore for vacation during their respective time with the Child. During these occasions, the non-travelling Party was granted up to 15 minutes daily of video or telephone access to the Child.

## Wife’s Application

5       On 18 June 2020, the Wife filed an application for further interim time with the Child up until 2022 with respect to the Child’s school break, birthday, and holidays. The Wife sought to divide the time during the said events equally between the Parties. The Husband agreed with the approach but disagreed with its application. To assist the court, the Wife’s Counsel helpfully prepared and filed a Hearing Aide on 12 October 2020 that summarised the Parties’ respective positions for each event.

6       After hearing the Parties’ evidence and submissions, I ordered the following:

> **School Break Access**

> (1)    The \[Wife\] is to have school break access with the Child as follows:-

>> (a)    For even numbered years, with effect from 2020, the \[Wife\] is to have \[the\] 2nd half of the Child's mid-year school break, and the 1st half of the Child's year-end school break; and

>> (b)    For odd numbered years, with effect from 2021, the \[Wife\] is to have the 1st half of the Child's mid-year school break, and the 2nd half of the Child's year-end school break.

> (2)    The Child's mid-year and year-end school break for 2020, 2021, and 2022 are defined as the mid-year and year-end 'child care services period' respectively as gazetted by the Child's school.

> (3)    The start time for the \[Parties'\] respective school break access is at 10 a.m. on the first day of the school break, and the end time is at 10 p.m. on the last day of the school break.

> (4)    During the Child's mid-year and year-end school break, the party not having physical access with the Child may exercise video call access with the Child for 5 minutes every day, at 8 p.m. if requested by the Child. The party having physical access with the Child shall facilitate the video call access.

> **Birthday Access**

> (5)    On the Child's birthday, \[XX XXX\], the \[Parties\] are to each have birthday access with the Child in alternate years, with the \[Wife\] having birthday access in odd numbered years, as follows:-

>> (a)    If the Child has school on her birthday, the relevant party's birthday access will be from after school to 10 p.m.; and

>> (b)    If the Child does not have school on her birthday, the relevant party's birthday access will be from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.

>> (c)    Parties are also at liberty to celebrate the Child's birthday in school jointly.

> **Public Holidays / School-Declared Holidays Access**

> (6)    The \[Parties\] are to have access on alternate gazetted public holidays (save for Chinese New Year Day 1 and Day 2, and Christmas Day), and school-declared holidays. Save as aforesaid, Clause 2(c) of the Order of Court dated 3 September 2019 is to stand.

> (7)    For the avoidance of doubt, subject to (8) below, if a public holiday falls on a Sunday, both that Sunday and the Off-in-Lieu on Monday are part of the public holidays / school-declared holidays alternating cycle.

> (8)    Access on Christmas Day and/or any Monday Off-In-Lieu if Christmas Day falls on a Sunday, shall be with the party having access during the half of the year-end school break in which Christmas Day and/or the said Monday Off-in-Lieu (whichever the case may be) falls.

> (9)    For Chinese New Year (“CNY"):-

>> (a)    Block 1 of CNY access is defined as:- (i) From after school on CNY Eve to 10 a.m. on CNY Day 1; and (ii) from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. on CNY Day 2; and

>> (b)    Block 2 of CNY access is defined as:- From 10 a.m. on CNY Day 1 to 10 a.m. on CNY Day 2.

> (10)  The \[Wife\] is to have CNY access as follows:-

>> (a)    For odd numbered years, with effect from 2021, the Plaintiff is to have Block 1 of CNY access; and

>> (b)    For even numbered years, with effect from 2022, the Plaintiff is to have Block 2 of CNY access.

> **Overseas Access**

> (11)  During each party's access, that party is at liberty to bring the Child overseas for holiday.

> (12)  The party traveling with the Child is to give the other party at least 14 days' notice, with the intended itinerary. The party traveling with the Child is to ensure that he / she has mobile phone roaming service during the period of travel.

> (13)  The \[Parties\] are at liberty to depart from the access schedule ordered, if mutually agreed between the \[Parties\].

> (14)  No order as to costs of this application.

> (15)  Liberty to apply.

7       The Wife appealed against the following two orders, the grounds of which I will elaborate in turn below.

> (2)    The Child's mid-year and year-end school break for 2020, 2021, and 2022 are defined as the mid-year and year-end 'child care services period' respectively as gazetted by the Child's school.

> (7)    For the avoidance of doubt, subject to (8) below, if a public holiday falls on a Sunday, both that Sunday and the Off-in-Lieu on Monday are part of the public holidays / school-declared holidays alternating cycle.

## Parties’ Cases and Decision

### Definition of School Break

8       The Parties’ positions on the definition of both school breaks differed marginally. The Wife submitted that the school breaks were those gazetted by the school _and_ the weekends before and after. She argued that this will allow Parties to have a longer uninterrupted period with the Child and it would facilitate overseas travel. Further, the Wife’s Counsel referred to my prior order of 30 October 2019 (see \[4\] above) for the similar period a year ago where the weekends were also included. The Husband opposed the Wife’s inclusion of the weekends in order to prevent confusion to the Child.

9       I found both Parties’ submissions fair and reasonable, but the issue was which method of calculation would be in the Child’s best interests. I was of the view that the exclusion of the weekends before and after was in the Child’s best interests. I agreed with the Husband that a degree of certainty would be important for the Child. In addition, I was cognisant of the age of the Child and the specific circumstances of the matter before me. The Wife’s submission was understandable from her perspective as it would allow the Wife to benefit from a longer uninterrupted period with the Child. However, this comes at the expense of _frequent contact by way of numerous intervals_ between the Child and each Party, a principle that forms the spirit of the existing care arrangements and is a manifestation of the attachment the Child has for them _both_. If the Wife’s approach is adopted, there will be less intervals involved for the Child between each Party for the same period of time.

10     Further, I was of the view that the circumstances surrounding the current application differed from those a year ago. A year ago, the Wife had relatively less contact with the Child because of the higher level of acrimony between the Parties and I found that a longer interrupted period with the Child was in the Child’s best interests _then_. With the routine of frequent contact between the Child and each parent having been established since, circumstances have changed and I was of the view that maintaining the principle of frequency in respect of the school break was in the Child’s best interests.

### Scope of Public Holidays

11     The Parties similarly could not find common ground on the issue of gazetted public holidays that fall on Sundays. For these holidays, the Wife took the view that the affected Sunday should fall _outside_ of the scope of the alternating public holiday schematic between the Parties. Instead, it is the Monday Off-in-Lieu immediately thereafter that should only be regarded as part of the schematic. She reasoned that her proposal would cause less disruption to the Child’s ordinary weekly access schedule. The Husband’s disagreed and submitted that both the Sunday and Monday ought to be part of the schematic.

12     I was not persuaded by the Wife’s proposal to exclude the Sunday from the schematic. The effect of the Wife’s proposal was to allow her to spend a longer uninterrupted period with the Child when implemented with the existing interim care arrangements ordered. Presently, the Child _inter alia_ spends every Saturday 6pm to Sunday 6pm with the Wife as part of the Child’s weekly schedule. The Wife’s proposal will accordingly ensure that this specific slot of hers is ring-fenced against the alternating public holiday schematic between the Parties.

13     Not only did I find that the Wife’s proposal strain what would otherwise be an unambiguous definition of what a gazetted public holiday is, I was of the view that it would not be in the Child’s best interests because it comes at the expense of frequency of contact by way of numerous intervals between the Child and each Party. This is the same ground articulated above at \[9\], but its reasoning differed slightly. Gazetted public holidays are not in abundant supply throughout the year and they are precious opportunities for parents to spend time with their children. These are even more precious for separated parents as they have often need to share a finite number of public holidays between each other. If a public holiday falls on a Sunday, separated parents can have additional time to share between each other on account of the additional public holiday on the Monday thereafter, and such frequent contact with each Party will benefit the Child in the circumstances of this case.

## Conclusion

14     In addition to dividing up the time between the Parties, I was mindful of the need for some flexibility between the Parties and I consequently granted them liberty to depart from the access schedule if mutually agreed. For instance, if a Party requires a longer uninterrupted period with the Child for an overseas holiday in the future, the Parties can negotiate amongst themselves to identify the additional time required and to find the appropriate time to exchange it for. Having the benefit of hearing the Parties over the course of the divorce proceedings thus far and the numerous applications before me, I am satisfied that they have the capacity to do so and they are more than able to find compromise whenever needed for the sake of the Child.

15     At the conclusion of the hearing, I made no order as to costs pursuant to the submissions made by both Parties.
