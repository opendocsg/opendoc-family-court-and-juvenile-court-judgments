variation of consent order – child access

21 June 2019

### District Judge Suzanne Chin:

## Introduction

1       This matter concerns cross applications made by the parents of a 3 year old boy (the “Child”) for variation of child access orders made by consent on 17 January 2018 (the “Consent Order”).

2       The Mother was requesting for the following:

(a)     That she be allowed to introduce her new husband and daughter as well as her extended families by marriage to the Child within fourteen days of the date of the relevant court order (“Court Order”);

(b)     That her weekly access times and place of access to the Child be adjusted in light of his new school hours and her changed circumstances ie marriage; and

(c)     That her access be allowed to take place even when the Child has a medical certificate stating that he is ill. She also wanted to be able to be present for all medical appointments concerning the Child.

3       The Father applied for the following orders:

(a)     that parties attend family therapy/counselling within 12 weeks of the relevant Court Order to put in place an agreed parenting plan for the Child;

(b)     that parties jointly appoint a family therapist/counsellor within two weeks of the relevant court order with costs being borne equally. In the event that parties are unable to jointly appoint a family therapist/counsellor within two weeks of the Court Order, parties shall engage Dr xxx from the Centre for Psychology as the jointly appointed family therapist/counsellor.

(c)     Pending parties’ agreement on the parenting plan for the Child and unless otherwise recommended by the jointly appointed family therapist/counsellor, the Mother shall not introduce her new husband, daughter or any of the members of her extended family by marriage to the Child.

(d)     that the Mother’s weekly access times be adjusted in light of his new school hours.

4       The parties appeared before me on 28 February 2019 and after hearing from the parties and considering all of the evidence before me, I made orders adjusting the timing and place of access and pick up but declined to make any other adjustments to the Consent Order save that I ordered that parties attend counselling at DSSA with a view to each of them learning how to cooperate and work together for the sake of the child

5       The Father has filed an appeal against some of the orders I made in respect of his application for variation. Specifically, he has appealed on the following:

a.     My dismissal of his prayers to vary the Consent Order such that the Mother would be prevented from introducing her new husband and baby daughter to the Child until such time that the parties reach an agreed Parenting Plan for the Child;

b.     My consequential orders for the parties to attend counselling at DSSA;

c.     My orders making adjustments to the timing and pick up location for the Mother’s access;

d.     My orders relating to the location for the Mother’s overnight access.

I set forth below the reasons for my decision in respect of the matters appealed against by the Father.

## Background

6       The parties were not married. They met and entered into a relationship sometime around March 2014. In July 2015, the Mother moved into the Father’s residence when she was pregnant and on xx xxx 2015, the Child, a son was born to the parties. By July 2017, the relationship between the parties had broken down and the Mother started a relationship with her current husband and moved out of the Father’s residence.

7       In November 2017, each of the parties filed applications for orders relating to the custody, care and control and access to the Child. Parties attended mediation at CFRC and on 17 January 2018, the Consent Order was recorded. The Consent Order provided for joint custody of the Child, granted care and control to the Father and specified the various times that the Mother was to have access to the Child. Amongst the terms for access by the Mother was a condition that no third parties were to be present during the Mother’s access save for her family members.

8       The Mother married her new husband on xx xxx 2018 and gave birth to her daughter on xx xxx 2018. On 25 March 2018, the Mother informed the Father of her marriage to her new husband. Notwithstanding that the Consent Order allowed the Mother’s family members to be present during access and hence her new husband and daughter who qualified as her family members were entitled to be present during her access times, the Father raised objections to the presence of the Mother’s new husband and daughter during her access. It was not disputed that since then, the Child has not met with the Mother’s new husband and daughter.

9       On 16 November 2018, the Mother applied for a variation of the Consent Order while the Father filed his application for variation of the Consent Order on 21 December 2018.

## The Legal Principles

10     The power of the court to vary orders relating to custody and care and control is encapsulated in Section 128 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353). A court may vary such orders where it is satisfied that the order was based on any misrepresentation or mistake of fact or where there has been any material change in the circumstances.

11     Section 125 of the Women’s Charter is also relevant. In the case of _ATS v ATT_ , the High Court noted that when considering s 128, it is also important to take into account s 125 which states that the welfare of the Child is a “paramount consideration.”

## The Father’s application to delay the introduction of Mother’s new husband and child during access

12     As mentioned above, under paragraph B (7) of the Consent Order, the parties agreed to the following:

_“No other party, save for family members, shall be present in the time that parties spend with the child.”_

## The Father’s position

13     The Father’s application for a variation on this agreed term can be broadly summarised as follows:

a.     for the court to order that parties jointly appoint a family therapist/counsellor within a prescribed period of time failing which, the family therapist/counsellor whom the Father had already appointed to prepare a psychological assessment on the Child be appointed.

b.     for the court to order that the parties attend family therapy/counselling with a view to putting in place an agreed parenting plan for the Child; and

c.     Pending the parties’ agreement on the parenting plan and unless recommended by the jointly appointed family therapist/counsellor, the Mother shall not introduce her new family members to the Child.

14     In his submissions, the Father did not refer to any misrepresentation or mistake of fact. He contended that by virtue of the Mother’s remarriage and the Child’s change of school hours, the threshold of a material change in the circumstances had been satisfied. He also argued that it was not in the Child’s best interest to be allowed to interact and meet with the Mother’s new husband and baby daughter at this point in time and he wanted what he referred to as a “structured approach” to be put in place so that the Child is gradually introduced to the Mother’s new husband and daughter. He asserted that it would be best for the Child if the parties attend family/therapy counselling with a view to arriving at an agreed parenting plan and claimed that the Child was not coping well with the changes in his Mother’s life. According to him, it was imperative to gradually ease the Child into recognising and accepting the new changes in his Mother’s life.

15     The Father contended that the Child had displayed disturbing signs and this had prompted him to send the Child for assessment by Dr xxx, a clinical psychologist from the Centre for Psychology. As a result of the said assessment, a child report was issued (“Child Report”). The Child Report had determined that the Child was struggling emotionally and based on this, the Father contended that the court should not allow the Mother to introduce her new family members to the Child. In this regard, the Father wanted the Court to admit and consider the abovementioned reports prepared by a clinical psychologist as evidence of the Child’s emotional state.

## The Mother’s position

16     The Mother objected to the admission of the Child Report contending that it should not be considered by the court as evidence as the requisite leave of the court had not been sought. She pointed out that the assessment conducted by the clinical psychologist was based only on input from and observations of the Father. No input had been sought from her. Accordingly, the Child Report could not be considered as being objective and reliable. It was her position that she had not observed any signs of distress on the part of the Child notwithstanding that she had access to the Child and had seen him 4 times a week for access. According to her, the Father had from the date of the Consent Order not raised any concerns about the Child’s supposed emotional difficulties or that the Child had been displaying signs of distress until after she informed him on the 25 March 2018 of her marriage to her current husband. She also drew the court’s attention to the fact that the Father had brought the Child to be assessed by the clinical psychologist only in early April shortly after she had notified him of her marriage to her new husband.

17     The Mother also maintained that since the Consent Order was made, there had been no material change in circumstances. It was not disputed that the Mother had been heavily pregnant at the time and she argued that the Father should have realised that when she eventually gave birth, her daughter would become a family member of the Mother. Likewise, in the circumstances, it would have been quite reasonable for the Father to anticipate the likely event that she would marry the father of her daughter shortly after her birth. As such, when the Father consented to the terms of the Consent Order and specifically agreed to the terms of clause B(7) of the Consent Order, all of this would have been contemplated. Accordingly, the birth of her daughter and her marriage to her new husband do not in the circumstances constitute a material change in circumstances.

## Admissibility of the Child Report.

18     I dealt first with the preliminary issue of admissibility of the Child Report. Rule 35 of the Family Justice Rules states as follows:

_“(1_)     _Where a child is a party to or a subject of any action of proceedings, or where any action or proceedings involve the welfare or custody of a child, a party must not, without the leave of the Court, cause the child to be examined or assessed by any registered medical practitioner, psychologist, counsellor, social worker or mental health professional for the purpose of preparing expert evidence for use in in those proceedings._

(_4_)     _Where a registered medical practitioner, psychologist, counsellor, social worker or mental health professional who is not appointed by the Court pursuant to an application under paragraph (1) examines or assesses the child, no evidence arising out the of examination or assessment may be adduced without the leave of the Court.”_

19     The Father maintained through his counsel that the Child was not being examined for the purpose of any child proceedings and hence Rule 35 did not apply. He argued that even if he did, he was requesting for the court to grant leave to admit the report as evidence given how germane it was to the issues at hand and the Child’s best interests. I did not accept the Father’s contentions. With all due respect, I was of the view that the examination of the Child by the child psychologist fell squarely within Rule 35. The purpose of the rule is to ensure that a child is not subject to unnecessary psychological assessment which could of itself lead to issues of its own. I proceeded however to consider the Father’s request for leave to admit the Child Report in any event. Upon examination of the Child Report, I noted that the psychological assessment of the Child took place when the Child was 2 years 8 months, an age when the Child was very young and questioned the reliability of any answers from the Child or tests conducted on the Child. I also found the findings of the report very general in nature. I noted also that it had been prepared without any input from the Mother and relied heavily on the Father’s observations. Taking all of this into consideration, I was not satisfied that the Child Report would throw any light on the specific issue of whether the introduction of the Mother’s new husband and baby daughter should be delayed and declined to grant leave to admit the Child Report into evidence.

## Decision on delay of introduction of Mother’s new family members

20     The first issue I had to consider was whether there had been a material change of circumstances warranting a variation of the Consent Order specifically to delay the introduction of the Mother’s new family members, namely her daughter, her new husband and extended family members by marriage. The Father asserted that the change in the child’s school hours provided the requisite material change of circumstances. While I did not disagree that the change in the child’s school hours would be considered a material change in respect of access timings and details, I did not think that this was relevant to the issue of whether the Mother should be restricted in introducing her new family members to the child during her access sessions. The question as such was whether by the Mother’s marriage to her new husband and birth of her daughter qualify as a material change warranting the variation of Clause B(7) of the Consent Order. Upon consideration of all of the facts and circumstances, I agreed with the Mother that it should have been within the contemplation of the Father when he had agreed to the terms of the Consent Order that upon the birth of the daughter, she would obviously become a family member of the Mother. Likewise, the Father should have considered the likelihood of the Mother marrying the Father of her new baby. Also the fact that para B(7) of the Consent Order refers to “family members”, points to the fact that this issue had been specifically contemplated and considered by the Father with the then circumstances in mind. In light of this, I was not satisfied that there had been a material change of circumstances warranting a variation of the Consent Order.

21     The next question I had to consider was whether taking into consideration the Child’s best interests, it would be necessary for a variation of the Consent Order to be made. Upon examination of the evidence before me, I did not see anything pointing to the fact that the Child had been emotionally affected as a result of his being made aware of the existence of his new sister and Mother’s new husband. It was not disputed that the Mother had introduced the Child to her new husband sometime at the end of 2017 when she moved out of the Father’s flat and had during access in early 2018 spoken to the Child about the impending birth of his sister. Even with all of this, I noted that the Father had not at the time raised any issues suggesting that the Child having been negatively impacted on. I found it telling that it was only after the Mother informed the Father of her remarriage, that these issues allegedly surfaced. There is no doubt that the Child has gone through many changes in his life over the last year, what with his Mother moving out and his not being able to see her daily. The Child is possibly feeling displaced with the change in his living environment i.e. his mother no longer lives with him. It may also be possible that the Child may be wondering what had happened to the bump in his mother’s tummy and why he has not been introduced to his new baby sister when the adults (including the child psychologists) are all talking about her and asking him about her. I was in fact concerned about the potential impact on the Child if the introduction of the Mother’s daughter and new husband was further delayed. I also took into consideration the fact that the Mother had in her evidence maintained that she had noticed nothing amiss during her access sessions with the Child which took place multiple times each the week. Based on all of this, I was not satisfied that there was in fact anything that pointed to the Child being in emotional distress. As a result of the Father’s objections, the Mother had refrained from introducing her new husband and baby daughter to the Child for almost a year. She had tried to arrive at an agreement with the Father to no avail. Upon consideration of all of this, I did not think it would be in the Child’s best interest for his introduction to his sister and the Mother’s new husband to be further delayed and accordingly declined to make orders delaying the introduction of the Mother’s daughter and new husband.

22     Since the Child is still very young, I was of the view that any such introduction and the generally, the Child’s well-being should be monitored. The parties should learn to cooperate and ensure that the Child’s best interests is always a primary consideration. During the hearing, counsel for the parties informed me that their clients had previously attended counselling at one of the the Divorce Support Specialist Agencies run by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (“DSSA”). In fact, shortly after the Consent Order was recorded, parties agreed to go for counselling at the DSSA with a view to coming up with a plan to introduce the Child to his new sister and the Mother’s husband. Unfortunately, after a few sessions and especially after the Mother notified the Father of her remarriage, the sessions at DSSA came to a grinding halt. During the hearing, counsel for both parties informed me that their respective clients would be agreeable going forward to attending counselling at DSSA with the same counsellor they had previously seen. Both counsels also indicated to me that their clients would be willing to comply with any recommendations made by the counsellor with regard to the Child. While I did not vary the Consent Order for the reasons already mentioned, which meant that there was no restriction on the Mother introducing her baby daughter and husband to the Child, given the continued acrimony between the parties and the age of the Child as well as submissions by counsel, I was of the view that it would be helpful for the parties to attend at the appropriate DSSA and be guided by the counsellor they had previously seen. This counsellor would be well placed to monitor the Child’s progress being a neutral party with some knowledge of the past history of the parties.

## Adjustments in timing and pick up location of access

23     At the time of the Consent Order, the Child was aged 2 years 5 months. Under the terms of the Consent Order, the Mother was granted weekly access to the Child on Tuesdays and Wednesdays from 12.45pm to 7.45pm and overnight access from Fridays at 12.45pm to Saturday 9.00pm. The Child was at the time attending half day school.

24     It was undisputed that the Child now attends full day childcare at his child care centre until 6pm every day, a material change in circumstances relating to weekly access timings. To accommodate the Child’s new schedule, the Father requested that the Mother’s access times be adjusted to commence at 6pm on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays after lessons at the child care centre and end at 8pm. He also wanted to be able to bring the Child home after childcare and to allow for a grace period of 30 minutes for the child to freshen up and change before he has access with his Mother. In addition, the Father requested for adjustments to be made under “Access on Special Occasions” in the Consent Order i.e. the Child’s birthday and the parties’ birthdays, to take into account the Child’s new school hours.

25     While the Mother acknowledged that the Child was currently attending full day childcare, she wanted her weekly access to start at 5.30pm with pick up of the Child from his childcare centre. This arrangement was to replace the current handover arrangements at the void deck of the Father’s residence. It was her contention that the Child’s classes officially starts at 9am and ends at 5.30pm and parents are free to arrange the timing of pick-up of their Child so long as the centre is notified beforehand. She also contended that she had been advised by the principal at the centre that most parents or caretakers pick up their Child at around 5pm to 5.30pm.

26     I noted that the Child is still very young at 3 years 8 months and I would question the need for such a young Child to attend full day childcare especially if there was someone at the Father’s residence to care for him. In any event, I accepted the Mother’s contentions about the flexibility of pick up times bearing in mind the age of the Child. Also, I was of the view that leaving school half an hour earlier 3 of the 5 days of each week to spend more time bonding with his Mother would be in the Child’s best interests. I also did not think it was necessary for the Child to be taken back to the Father’s residence to “freshen up” before seeing his Mother and weighed this against the resultant shorter period of access to the Mother should this be allowed.

27     With regard to the Mother’s request to pick the Child from the child care centre instead of the void deck of the Father’s residence, I considered that this would allow the Child to spend more time with his mother and would provide a clear routine for the Child. In addition, given the risk of continued acrimony between the parents, I was of the view that such an arrangement would lessen the exposure of the Child to additional incidents of acrimony between his parents and this certainly would be in his best interests. Accordingly, I adjusted the Mother’ weekly access as follows:

(a)     Tuesday and Wednesday from 5.30pm to 8pm. and;

(b)     Friday 5.30pm from school to Saturday 9pm.

Pick up shall be from the child care centre and return shall be to the void deck of the Father’s residence.

28     Consistent with my reasons listed above, I also adjusted the timing for “Access on Special Occasions” to also start at 5.30pm on a weekday.

## Change in the location of Overnight Access

29     After moving out from the Father’s house, the Mother resided with her own mother. The Consent Order accordingly specified that the Mother would exercise overnight access at her mother’s residence. Since then and after her marriage with her new husband, the Mother has moved into a new place of residence with her new husband, her daughter and his family. Consistent with my decision above not to vary the Consent Order to impose a delay in the introduction of the Mother’s daughter and new husband to the Child and given the new realities of the Mother’s life, I considered that it would be reasonable for the Mother to be able to have overnight access with the Child at her current residence and accordingly included this as an alternative location to her mother’s residence for overnight access.

## Conclusion

30     While the circumstances of this current case are difficult for the Child and parties should work together towards providing him with stability in his environment and life, the Child also needs to adjust to the new realities in his life which in this case is the fact that his Mother has remarried and he has a new baby sister. The Mother has clearly demonstrated that she does have the best interests at heart and given that both parties have agreed to go to counselling to monitor the introduction of the Mother’s new family members to the Child and their indication that they will comply with the recommendations of the DSSA, I am confident that parties will act in the best interests of the Child.
