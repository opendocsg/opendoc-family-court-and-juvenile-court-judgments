Family Law – maintenance – enforcement – enforcement of maintenance order – s71, Women’s Charter

13 August 2019

### District Judge Suzanne Chin:

## Introduction

1       This appeal relates to orders made in respect of an application brought by the complainant son (“Son”) under Section 71 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353), to enforce MO 126/2019 (the “Maintenance Order”), a maintenance order made in respect of MSSxxx/2018 and dated 27 February 2019 against the Respondent Father (“Father”).

2       The matter came before me on 23 May 2017 and after considering all of the evidence before me and the submissions of the parties, I ordered the Father to pay the Son, agreed arrears of $10,172 as at 23 May 2017 in a lump sum on or before 3 June 2019 into the Son’s designated bank account. I also ordered that the Complainant was to show proof of payment at the Maintenance Mediation Chambers at level 2 of the Family Justice Courts building at 4pm on 6 June 2019 failing which the Father was to be imprisoned for 2 days.

3       The Father has filed an appeal against my orders and I set forth the reasons for my decision.

## Background

4       The Son was at the time of the hearing 22 years of age. He had filed an application for fresh maintenance against the Father on 28 June 2018. The matter was heard and on 27 February 2019, the Maintenance Order was made. Under the Maintenance Order, the Father was ordered to bear a proportion of the Son’s tuition fees, accommodation costs, airfare, daily expenses etc. in respect of the Son’s further tertiary studies. The order specified that the Father was to make payment upon receiving the requisite notification from the Son of the relevant amount due.

5       Notwithstanding that the Son had provided the Father with the requisite notice informing him of the amount due and that this was due on 15 March 2019, the Father had failed to make any payment of the maintenance amount under the Maintenance Order. Accordingly, the Son filed an application for enforcement of Maintenance Order of 18 March 2019.

## Agreed amount of arrears

6       The Son informed the court that the amount of arrears outstanding under the Maintenance Order amounted to $10,172 as at the date of the trial. The Father did not dispute this amount and indicated his consent to the amount during direct examination by counsel. As such, it was noted that the agreed arrears totalled a sum of $10,172 as at 23 May 2019.

## The Respondent’s claims

7       The Father informed the court that he was 60 years old and had retired from his previous job just 2 months before the hearing. He explained to the court that he had always earned an income of $1,000 each month before he retired. As he now earns nothing, he maintained that he had no means of paying the arrears.

8       He claimed that he had debts to pay and that he owed his previous employer money. In addition, he tendered evidence of his bank account statements which showed that he had only $433.58 standing in his bank accounts. He maintained that this was all the money he had. Accordingly, when asked if he had a proposal on how he was to pay for the outstanding arrears, he said he needed a month to consider how he was going to make payment and would in all likelihood have to borrow money to pay off the amount. He however did not make any proposal on how he intended to settle the arrears.

## Decision

9       While the Father made claims about his having retired from employment 2 months prior to the hearing of this matter he did not tender any evidence to support his bare assertions. His affidavit filed on 14 May 2019, with the assistance of counsel who was appointed on 26 April 2019, did not make any reference to his having retired nor were any documents exhibited to show that he had indeed retired. The Father also admitted that his employer, xxx Private Limited (“Company”) was actually 100% owned by him. He claimed however that he had sold the Company to a friend for $2.00 just recently but yet again produced no evidence to support his contentions.

10     The Father also tendered copies of his various bank statements. While he claimed that he now only had a total of $433.58 in all his bank accounts, I noted that his bank statements reflected the following:

> (a)     a balance of $378,138 on 1 January 2018 and a closing balance of $86,138 on 3 December 2018;

> (b)     a balance of $43,635 for 1st March 2018 to 30 March 2018;

11     The Father agreed that taking into account the opening balance in his bank account statements as at 1 January 2018 and the closing balance on 3 December 2018, he had spent an amount of $291,258 in the span of 12 months i.e. an average of $24,115 each month. Firstly, I considered this amount in light of the Respondent’s contentions that he had always been earning $1,000 a month. If indeed that were the case, I found it difficult to accept how that the Respondent had amassed such a huge amount of money in his personal bank account and how someone in that position would spend $24,115 each month. Secondly the Father claimed that he had spent this amount on capital repayment for his house. Yet again, he produced no evidence to support his bare assertions. Taking into account all of the above, I was not satisfied that this entire amount of $291,258 had been spent on the capital payment for the Respondent’s house or even spent at all and drew the conclusion that the Respondent had not satisfactorily proven that he no longer held the funds.

12     With regard to the sum of $43,635 as at March 2019, the Father did not dispute the fact that he had had the monies to pay the maintenance amount on 15 March 2019. It was also not disputed that the Father had received the email sent by the Son to inform him of the amount due and the date when this was due. Instead of paying the Son the amount as ordered by the Court, the Father claimed to have used the money for his company. Without providing any further explanation nor acknowledging that he should have made payment of the outstanding amount at the time when he had the funds, he submitted that since he no longer had these monies, he needed time to find the money to pay the outstanding arrears. I found this position put forward by the Father highly unsatisfactory.

13     Taking all of the above into consideration, I was firstly not convinced that the Father had officially retired and no longer had any sources of income. Secondly, I did not accept the fact that the Father was no longer the owner of the Company. While he claimed that the company was in debt and he had accordingly sold the Company to his friend for a sum $2.00, he provided nothing to support his claim. Lastly, I was of the view that the Father had not provided any satisfactory explanation as to what had happened to (a) the sum of $291,258 which he claimed he had spent between January 2018 and December 2018 and (b) the sum of $43,625 standing in his accounts in March 2019. Taking all of this into consideration, I drew the conclusion that the Father had not made full and frank disclosure and determined that the Father did indeed have the means to pay for the agreed arrears. I accordingly made orders requiring the Father to pay to the Son the outstanding arrears in a single lump sum payment and gave him 10 days to make the payment.

## Conclusion

14     At the hearing, counsel for the Son informed the court that this was the third time that the Son had requested for an extension of time to make payment for his tuition fees for the upcoming school year which was to have commenced in August 2018. In this regard, the Son had been told by the relevant tertiary institution that this was the final extension of time being granted to him. Bearing this in mind and considering the likely event of the Son losing his place to study at the relevant tertiary institution should payment not be made and in a bid to ensure that payment of the agreed arrears is made by the Father in accordance with my orders, I ordered that the Father provide proof of payment at the Maintenance Mediation Chambers at the Family Justice Courts by 4pm on 6 June 2019 failing which he serves prison for 2 days for default.
