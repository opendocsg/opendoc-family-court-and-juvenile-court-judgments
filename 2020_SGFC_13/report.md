Ancillary Matters – short – childless marriage

4 February 2020

### District Judge Geraldine Kang:

## Brief Background

1       For ease of reference, parties shall be referred to Husband (39 years old) and Wife (36 years old) in this written grounds of decision.

2       Briefly, parties were married sometime in May 2009. Interim Judgement was granted sometime in January 2018 on the basis of 3 years separation since May 2014. There was a dispute between parties as to the length of marriage that the court should have regard to – the Husband took the position that the marriage was effectively a 5 year one whereas the Wife took the position that it ought to be regarded as a 7 year one calculated up to the point of the Interim Judgement and not the fact of separation as pleaded of May 2014.

3       Parties registered their marriage in Singapore although neither party was a Singapore citizen. The Wife is a Chinese National who has since been residing in Hong Kong and/or China, whereas the Husband is a Canadian citizen who was domiciled in Singapore.

4       During the course of the marriage, the Husband was the sole breadwinner whilst the Wife was not in any formal employment. The Wife often travelled and was not in Singapore for various reasons.

5       As there were no children borne to the union, the only ancillary issues for determination were financial ones as follows:

> (a)     The Wife’s maintenance; and

> (b)     The division of matrimonial assets.

6       Prior to the commencement of the hearing, the Wife had uncovered that the Husband had commenced a new employment and accordingly sought leave to adduce evidence of this new employment. I granted leave for in this regard as this was relevant towards her claim for maintenance.

7       Having heard parties and the evidence in this matter, I ordered that each party to retain their respective assets and that backdated maintenance of 10 months (ie. July 2017 to May 2018) at $1,000 per month be paid to the Wife with no order for future maintenance was granted. Finally, each party were to bear their own legal costs.

8       The Wife is now appealing against the entirety of my decision.

## (1)   Division of Matrimonial Assets - The Law

9       The law relating to the power of the court to order division of matrimonial assets is stipulated in Section 112 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353):

> (_1_)     _The court shall have power, when granting or subsequent to the grant of a judgement of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage, to order the division between the parties of any matrimonial asset or the sale of any such asset and the division between the parties of the proceeds of the sale of any such asset in such proportions as the court thinks just and equitable._

> (_2_)     _It shall be the duty of the court in deciding whether to exercise its power under subsection (1) and, if so, in what manner, to have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the following matters:_

>> (_a_)     _the extent of the contributions made by each party in money, property or work towards acquiring, improving or maintaining the matrimonial assets;_

>> (_b_)     _any debt owing or obligation incurred or undertaken by either party for their joint benefit or for the benefit of any child of the marriage;_

>> (_c_)     _the needs of the children (if any);_

>> (_d_)     _the extent of contributions made by each party to the welfare of the family, including looking after the home or caring for the family or any aged or infirm relative or dependant of either party;_

>> (_e_)     _any agreement between the parties with respect to the ownership and division of the matrimonial assets made in contemplation of divorce._

>> (_f_)     _any period of rent-free occupation or other benefit enjoyed by one party in the matrimonial home to the exclusion of the other party;_

>> (_g_)     _the giving of assistance or support by one party to the other party (whether or not of a material kind), including the giving of assistance or support which aids the other party in the carrying on of his or her occupation or business; and_

>> (_h_)     _the matters referred to in section 114(1) so far as they are relevant._

10     The Court of Appeal in **_ANJ v ANK <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span>_** gave guidance in relation to the structured approach for the division of assets under which courts will first ascribe a ratio that represents each party’s direct financial contributions towards the acquisitions of the matrimonial assets, relative to that of the other party. Next, the court will ascribe a second ratio which represents each parties’ indirect contribution to the well-being of the family. If the necessary, the court has a discretion to make further adjustments to this average ratio after taking into account the other factors set out in s 112(2) of the Women’s Charter as well as all relevant circumstances to arrive at a just and equitable division of the matrimonial assets.

## (2)   The Matrimonial Pool and its division

11     The Wife’s position in relation to the division of the matrimonial pool was a vacillating one; whereas the Husband had proposed a more consistent approach that each party was to retain their own assets[^1].

12     The parties resided at a condominium after their marriage. It was not disputed that the Husband acquired this property in his sole name prior to the marriage and for which he made 100% of the direct contributions – the initial capital payment as well as all monthly repayments towards the mortgage.

13     Given that the Wife did not work and was also frequently travelling, and this was a short childless marriage I did not think that there could have been significant indirect contributions made by the Wife that would have merited any adjustments to the average ratio that she was seeking.

14     I also took into account the fact of their physical separation in May 2014. I find it unlikely that they would have been able to jointly work towards putting in effort towards acquiring, building or accumulating matrimonial assets together.

15     The principles of _ANJ v ANK_ as set out by the Court of Appeal is undoubtedly a useful and binding one. However the facts of this case was clearly distinguishable and further, whichever way it was sliced, I could not see how what the Wife was seeking was a “fair and equitable” division. In fact, I find it disconcerting as well that her own counsel conceded so, but was just trying her luck to get more (to put it colloquially)[^2] .

## (3)   Power of court to order maintenance

16     The law relating to the power of the court to order maintenance and the assessment of such maintenance is found in sections 113 and Section 114 (Cap. 353).

> Section 113

> (_1_)     _The court may order a man to pay maintenance to his wife or former wife, or order a woman to pay maintenance to her incapacitated husband or incapacitated former husband -_

>> (_a_)     _during the course of any matrimonial proceedings, or_

>> (_b_)     _when granting or subsequent to the grant of a judgement of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage._

> Section 114

> (_1_)     _In determining the amount of any maintenance to be paid by a man to his wife or former wife, or by a woman to her incapacitated husband or incapacitated former husband, the court shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the following matters:_

>> (_a_)     _the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future._

>> (_b_)     _the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;_

>> (_c_)     _the standard of living enjoyed by the family before the breakdown of the marriage;_

>> (_d_)     _the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage;_

>> (_e_)     _any physical or mental disability of either of the parties to the marriage;_

>> (_f_)     _the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family; and_

>> (_g_)     _in the case of proceedings for divorce or nullity of marriage, the value to either of the parties to the marriage of any benefit (for example, a pension) which, by reason of the dissolution or annulment of the marriage that party will lose the chance of acquiring._

> (_2_)     _In exercising its powers under this section, the court shall endeavour so to place the parties, so far as it is practicable and, having regard to their conduct, just to do so, in the financial position in which they would have been if the marriage had not broken down and each had properly discharged his or her financial obligations and responsibilities towards the other._

17     The Court of Appeal in **_ATE v ATD <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGCA 2</span>_** enunciated specific principles in relation to the issue of nominal maintenance – put simply – it was sought to preserve the right of the wife to apply for substantive maintenance should the need arise in the future. It was clear to the Court of Appeal that:

> \[28\]… **_The courts cannot – and ought not to – order nominal maintenance automatically or as a matter of course._**

> \[29\]… **_it will not suffice for the wife to argue – without more – that she is entitled to an order of nominal maintenance simply because her situation might change in the future._** Indeed, it has, in general, never been the duty of the courts to compensate parties for **_the vicissitudes of life_**… This would be wholly _contrary_ to the very _purpose_ of awarding maintenance to a former wife in the first place – a point to which we will return shortly. For present purposes, it suffices to note that an application for nominal maintenance takes place in the context of a marriage that has already been **_terminated_**. In any event, it has never been – and ought not to be – the case that a party (let alone a _former_ spouse) has a duty to be a _general insurer vis-à-vis_ another party. Indeed, in order to provide for the vicissitudes of life, persons generally have recourse to the purchase of **_insurance policies_**.

**_\[Emphasis in original\]_**

18     At paragraph \[31\] of the same decision, the Court of Appeal also reiterated the underlying rationale and purpose for the award of maintenance generally to former wives was that of financial preservation. It was also observed with approval that an award of maintenance for a former wife takes into account the fact that a former wife ought to try to regain self-sufficiency and that an order of maintenance is not intended to create life-long dependency on the former husband.

## (4)   Wife’s Maintenance

19     The Wife sought a lump sum maintenance of $80,000 but this figure fluctuated over the course of the hearing.

20     I agreed that a lump sum maintenance was an appropriate order in this instance as parties were relatively young, in the prime of their employability and thus able to be self-sufficient. In addition, as they were likely to reside in different cities post-divorce, a clean break would be their respective interests thereby avoiding any possible enforcement issues, should there be any late or non-payment of monthly maintenance sums.

## (5)   Application of the Law to the Facts

21     Having considered the evidence before me, credit was also given to the Husband for providing maintenance to the Wife albeit not in a constant and fixed quantum even when their marriage was breaking down.

22     I had ordered a backdated maintenance sum in light of the fact that the Husband’s own concession that he was indeed willing and able to maintain the Wife; but moving forward and on the principles as expounded in _ATE v ATD_, I found that this was an appropriate case for no orders of maintenance to be made.

## (6)   The Court’s Findings and Decision

23     Accordingly, I made the orders I did and that each party were to bear their own costs.
