Matrimonial law – Women’s Charter – Ancillary issues – Division of assets – Maintenance of former wife

6 December 2019

### District Judge Sheik Mustafa:

## Introduction

1       The Wife and the Husband (the Plaintiff and the Defendant respectively) of this case were divorced from each other by virtue of an interim judgment on 19 April 2018. This was by consent of the two of them. They also agreed to an order that they share joint custody of their two children (aged 13 and 19); that the Husband is to have care and control of them; and that the Wife is to have liberal access. They also agreed to an order that the Husband shall solely maintain the children. They had been married for 20½ years.

2       The parties could not come to an agreement on other ancillary matters, which are concerning the issue of division of assets and about maintenance of the Wife. After hearing the counsel’s arguments on these ancillary issues, I ordered the following–

> 1.     The Wife shall transfer all her rights interest and share in a property (which is referred to in these Grounds as “the condominium”) to the Husband upon the Husband’s refund of the Wife’s CPF contributions to it, with accrued interest thereon. The Husband shall bear all expenses related to the transfer. The transfer shall take place within 6 months of the date of the final judgement to be issued herein.

> 2.     The Husband shall transfer all his rights interest and share in another property (which is referred to in these Grounds as “the Hougang flat”) to the Wife upon the Wife’s refund of the Husband’s CPF contributions to it, with accrued interest thereon, and an additional consideration of $63,000.00. The Wife shall bear all expenses related to the transfer. The transfer shall take place within 6 months of the date of the final judgement to be issued herein.

> 3.     Each party shall be absolutely and solely entitled to all other assets that are already in their own respective names.

> 4.     The Husband is not liable for maintenance of the Wife.

> 5.     No order as to costs.

3       The Wife appeals against my orders relating to the transfers of the two properties and against my order that the Husband not to be liable for maintenance to her.

4       The following are the reasons for my judgment.

## The Matrimonial Assets

5       There are two immovable properties jointly owned by both the parties. Both the properties were acquired during the course of the marriage.

6       There is a condominium. Parties agree that its value is $1,120,000. The Husband and children reside there. There is an outstanding mortgage of $603,900 on this property. This leaves its net value to be $516,100.

7       There is an HDB flat at Hougang. Parties agree that the value is $450,000. There is no outstanding mortgage on this property.

8       The total matrimonial asset pool comprises of the following –

## Applicable principles on division of assets

9       As a start to my inquiry into dealing with the assets, I refer to section 112 of the Women’s Charter –

> 112.—(1)    The court shall have power, when granting or subsequent to the grant of a judgment of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage, to order the division between the parties of any matrimonial asset or the sale of any such asset and the division between the parties of the proceeds of the sale of any such asset in such proportions as the court thinks just and equitable.

> (2)    It shall be the duty of the court in deciding whether to exercise its powers under subsection (1) and, if so, in what manner, to have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the following matters:

>> (a)    the extent of the contributions made by each party in money, property or work towards acquiring, improving or maintaining the matrimonial assets;

>> (b)    any debt owing or obligation incurred or undertaken by either party for their joint benefit or for the benefit of any child of the marriage;

>> (c)    the needs of the children (if any) of the marriage;

>> (d)    the extent of the contributions made by each party to the welfare of the family, including looking after the home or caring for the family or any aged or infirm relative or dependant of either party;

>> (e)    any agreement between the parties with respect to the ownership and division of the matrimonial assets made in contemplation of divorce;

>> (f)    any period of rent-free occupation or other benefit enjoyed by one party in the matrimonial home to the exclusion of the other party;

>> (g)    the giving of assistance or support by one party to the other party (whether or not of a material kind), including the giving of assistance or support which aids the other party in the carrying on of his or her occupation or business; and

>> (h)    the matters referred to in section 114(1) so far as they are relevant. These are –

>>> (a)    the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;

>>> (b)    the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;

>>> (c)    the standard of living enjoyed by the family before the breakdown of the marriage;

>>> (d)    the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage;

>>> (e)    any physical or mental disability of either of the parties to the marriage;

>>> (f)    the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family; and

>>> (g)    in the case of proceedings for divorce or nullity of marriage, the value to either of the parties to the marriage of any benefit (for example, a pension) which, by reason of the dissolution or annulment of the marriage that party will lose the chance of acquiring.

10     The Court of Appeal in the case of _ANJ V ANK_[^1] outlined the approach in division of matrimonial assets. Accordingly, the task for me is to derive a ratio, which represents the parties’ respective direct contributions towards the acquisition or improvement of matrimonial assets. Next, is to derive a second ratio, which represents the parties’ indirect financial and non-financial contributions towards the welfare of the family. I should then average the two ratios to derive each party’s overall contribution to the family. The “average percentage contribution” or “average ratio” are non-binding figures, and I would have to make adjustments as and when necessary. I bore these in mind, as well as that adjustments might also be necessary whenever the parties’ collective direct contribution do not carry the same weight as that of the parties’ collective indirect contribution.

11     Division of matrimonial assets is not an exact science, but neither is it an indefinable art. It is not mandatory for the court to exercise its power of division in every single asset of the parties before it as long as it did not detract for the court’s overall mandate to achieve a just and equitable division in the light of all of the circumstances of the case[^2].

## Application of the law to the facts

##### Direct contributions

12     There are numerous points of factual dispute on the direct contributions of each party, and this is reasonably to be expected in a marriage as long as the present one, of 21years.

13     The parties acquired the Hougang flat using their CPF. This is not in dispute.

>   
| 

a.

 | 

Wife’s CPF payments to Hougang flat

 | 

$149,436,

 |
| 

b.

 | 

Husband’s CPF payments to Hougang flat

 | 

$272,043.

 |

  
  

14     There is a dispute on the facts about the parties’ contributions to the condominium. From their CPF accounts, the Wife contributed $240 and the Husband $141,908 to its acquisition. The Wife claims that she paid as follows–

> a.     $240 from her CPF,

> b.     $22,628.00 for stamp duty,

> c.     $140,105.00 for down payment, and

> d.     $20,000.00 for furniture and fittings.

15     The Husband claims that he paid as follows –

> a.     $141,908 from his CPF,

> b.     $46,701.80 being booking fee,

> c.     $30,000 for stamp fee and down payment, and

> d.     $50,614 for mortgage instalments.

16     In addition, there were payments towards the condominium totalling $132,732 from money collected from renting the Hougang flat.

17     Based on the evidence adduced, I find as follows -

> a.     Both parties made the respective payments from their CPF accounts of $240 by the Wife and $141,908 by the Husband,

> b.     There was a booking fee of $46,701.80 that was paid by the Wife,

> c.     There were stamp fees and down payment of $430,000 paid by the Husband,

> d.     There were mortgage instalments of $50,614 paid by the Husband,

> e.     The payments from the rent of the Hougang flat ought to be allocated equally between them at $66,636 each.

18     A summary of each party’s direct contributions to the two jointly acquired properties is as follows.

19     As can be seen above, the direct contributions made by the parties is 31.9 : 68.1 in terms of the first ratio prescribed by _ANJ V ANK._

##### Indirect contributions

20     The second ratio prescribed by _ANJ V ANK_ is that of the indirect financial and non-financial contributions towards the welfare of the family.

21     Both parties laid contradictory versions about each other in this regard. What is clear, however, is that this is a moderately long marriage, in which both parties played parental and household roles of varying degrees and form at different stages of their marital and parental journey. They were both working parents. They both attended to the children.

22     I applied a broad-brush approach to the issue. The totality of the evidence shows that there was no significant imbalance in non-financial contributions to the household.

23     I therefore find the second ratio prescribed by _ANJ V_ ANK to be 50:50.

##### Average ratio and result

24     Thirdly, as prescribed by _ANJ V ANK_, I then averaged the two ratios to derive each party’s overall contribution to the family. I find that in the overall circumstances of the case, the direct and indirect contributions have equal weight of 50:50. I find thus because there is no substantial imbalance between the parties’ direct and indirect contributions that calls for the two to be accorded different weightage.

## Conclusion on division of assets

25     First, I allocated the assets in sole names between the parties –

26     The combined net value of the two properties is $966,100. In order to realise the parties’ respective shares, I ordered the Husband to retain the condominium since he is already residing there with the children. He will have to refund to the Wife her CPF contribution of $240 with interest.

27     I ordered the Wife to retain the Hougang flat worth $450,000. There remains a difference of $62,466. This is resolved if she makes a partial refund to the Husband’s CPF contributions of that amount.

28     With the CPF refund of $62,466 00 from the Wife, the Husband will then realise his share of $894,223. The end result will be as follows –

29     I rounded off the figure of the CPF refund to the Husband by the Wife to $63,000.

30     I was satisfied that this division of the matrimonial assets is just and fair, not only for the reasons above, but also taking into account that the children of the marriage will continue to reside with the Husband after the divorce. On the other hand, the Wife will be living by herself. A larger share of the assets granted to the Husband will enable not only him, but the children of the parties as well, to afford accommodation for themselves. This is a relevant consideration under s112(2)(c) of the Women’s Charter –

> **112**.    (2) It shall be the duty of the court in deciding whether to exercise its powers under subsection (1) and, if so, in what manner, to have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the following matters: …

>> (c)    the needs of the children (if any) of the marriage.

33     The Wife is an assistant accountant earning a gross income of $4,510 monthly. This is recent. Her salary increased over time, since she married the Husband. At the time of commencing the marriage her salary was $1,800.

34     The Wife also receives rental income of $2,000 from the rental of the Hougang flat.

35     The Husband has a salary of $13,461.

36     The Wife’s prayer is for an order of lump sum maintenance of $600,000. This is because after the divorce she would lose the monthly rent of $2,000. She submits that the Husband is able to pay the sum. She also submits that this is a long marriage of 22 years and her indirect contribution justifies the figure claimed. She seeks to be placed in a financial situation before the marriage had broken down. This is based on a mis-quote of section 114(2) of the Women’s Charter, which actually states as follows –

> (2).  In exercising its powers under this section, the court shall endeavour so to place the parties, so far as it is practicable and, having regard to their conduct, just to do so, _in the financial position in which they would have been if the marriage had not broken down_ and each had properly discharged his or her financial obligations and responsibilities towards the other.

## Applicable principles on nominal maintenance of a former wife

37     On the issue of maintenance for a former wife, the Women’s Charter provides –

> 114.— (1)    In determining the amount of any maintenance to be paid by a man to his wife or former wife, or by a woman to her incapacitated husband or incapacitated former husband, the court shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the following matters:

>> (a)    the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;

>> (b)    the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;

>> (c)    the standard of living enjoyed by the family before the breakdown of the marriage;

>> (d)    the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage;

>> (e)    any physical or mental disability of either of the parties to the marriage;

>> (f)    the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family; and

>> (g)    in the case of proceedings for divorce or nullity of marriage, the value to either of the parties to the marriage of any benefit (for example, a pension) which, by reason of the dissolution or annulment of the marriage that party will lose the chance of acquiring.

38     The Court of Appeal stated in _ATE v ATD_[^3], that this Court

> “cannot – and ought not to – order nominal maintenance automatically or as a matter of course… the court has to examine closely all the facts and circumstances of the case before deciding whether or not to award nominal maintenance in order to preserve the wife’s right to apply for maintenance in future.”

39     The Court of Appeal added that it will not suffice for the wife to argue – without more – that she is entitled to an order if nominal maintenance simply because her situation might change in future. Indeed, it has, in general, never been the duty of the courts to compensate parties for the vicissitudes of life. It would also result (in substance and effect) in making the husband a general insurer of sorts. This would be wholly contrary to the very purpose of awarding maintenance to a former wife in the first place.

## Conclusion on maintenance of the wife

40     On this issue, I take into account the following relevant facts –

> a.     The Wife has been employed for most of the marriage, including the present, and there is no indication that she would lose that capacity any time soon;

> b.     The children will live with the Husband;

> c.     There is no order for the Wife to contribute to the maintenance of the children;

> d.     After the division of the matrimonial assets, the Wife will be left with a substantial share of 40.9% of the total matrimonial asset pool. This includes the Hougang flat absolutely after she refunds $63,000 to the Husband’s CPF;

> e.     As I have ordered her to retain the Hougang flat to herself, she is able to continue to collect rent from it. In other words, there should be no loss in her income, which is a gross of approximately $6,500.

41     I find that the above ought to be substantial enough to remove the Wife’s need for maintenance from the Husband.

42     In addition, applying section 114 as well as the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in _ATE v ATD_, I find that the circumstances of the present case are not so exceptional such that there is a need to preserve nominal maintenance for the Wife.

43     In view of the above, I ordered that there should be no maintenance payable by the Husband to the Wife.
