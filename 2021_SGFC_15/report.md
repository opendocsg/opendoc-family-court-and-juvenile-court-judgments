Family law – Variation – Consent Order – Division of Matrimonial Assets

22 February 2021

### District Judge Chia Wee Kiat:

## Background

1       There were two applications before me. The first application FC/SUM 1512/2020 (“SUM 1512”) was filed by the Defendant on 16 June 2020 and the second application FC/SUM 2311/2020 (“SUM 2311”) was filed by the Plaintiff on 8 September 2020.

2       The parties were married on 11 November 2011. There are no children to the marriage. On 16 July 2018, the Plaintiff (the wife) commenced divorce proceedings. This was contested by the Defendant (the husband) who filed a Defence and Counterclaim on 21 August 2018. Interim Judgment was granted on 19 March 2019 on the Defendant’s Counterclaim and the ancillaries were adjourned to chambers. On 21 June 2019, the parties entered into a consent order (“the Consent Order”) resolving all ancillary matters. The Interim Judgment was made final on 7 August 2019.

3       SUM 1512 and SUM 2311 were applications to vary cl. 1(2) of the Consent Order. The applications were heard on 20 January 2021 and I gave my decision on 28 January 2021 with brief grounds. I indicated that in the event of an appeal, full written grounds will be rendered in accordance with the Family Justice Rules.

4       As the Defendant filed Notice of Appeal on 10 February 2021, I now set out my grounds of decision.

## Consent Order

5       The Consent Order provides as follows:

> **1**      **Division of the Matrimonial Home**

> 1    The Defendant shall be given the option to retain the property at \[redacted\] (the “Flat”) within six (6) months of the Certificate of Making Interim Judgment Final (the “FJ”):

>> i.    Upon the Defendant’s exercise of the option to retain the Flat, the Plaintiff shall transfer her interest in the Flat (other than by way of sale to the Defendant upon the Defendant refunding to the Plaintiff’s CPF account all monies utilised by her plus accrued interest towards the Flat as at the date of the transfer.

>> ii.    The defendant shall also take over the outstanding mortgage loan and bear all costs and expenses to the transfer.

> 2    Should the Defendant not exercise the option to take over the Flat within the period of six (6) months from the date of the FJ, the Flat shall be sold in the open market within twelve (12) months of the date of the FJ and the sale proceeds shall be utilised in the following manner:

>> i.    Payment of the outstanding mortgage loan on the Flat;

>> ii.    Payment of all costs and expenses arising out of and/or incidental to the sale (including but not limited to agent’s commission, legal fees and disbursements) in the proportion of 50.0% to the Defendant and 50.0% to the Plaintiff;

>> iii.   To refund all the Plaintiff’s CPF monies and accrued interest;

>> iv.    The balance shall be payable to the Defendant; and

>> v.    The Defendant shall refund to his CPF account all monies (plus accrued interest) utilized by him for the purchase of the Flat.

> 3    The orders made herein are subject to the Central Provident Fund Act (Cap.36) (the “CPF Act”) and the subsidiary legislation made thereunder. The CPF Board shall give effect to the terms of this order in accordance with the provisions of the CPF Act and the subsidiary legislation made thereunder.

> 4    The Registrar or the Deputy Registrar of the Family Justice Courts under Section 31 of the Family Justice Act (Act 27 of 2014) is empowered to execute, sign or indorse all necessary documents relating to matters contained in this order on behalf of either party should either party fail to do so within seven (7) days of a written request being made to the other party.

> **2**      **Division of the matrimonial assets (aside from the matrimonial home)**

> There shall be no further division of matrimonial assets and each party is to retain his/her assets in their respective names and/or with third parties.

> **3**      **Maintenance for wife/incapacitated husband**

> There shall be no maintenance payable to the Plaintiff.

> **4**      **Others**

> 1    The aforesaid shall be in full and final settlement of all claims between the Plaintiff and the Defendant and there shall be no further claims by one party against the other in this respect;

> 2    Parties to bear their own costs; and

> 3    Liberty to apply

6       Under the Consent Order, the Defendant was given the option to take over the Flat within 6 months of the Final Judgment (i.e. by 6 February 2020) failing which the Flat was to be sold on the open market within 12 months from the date of the Final Judgment (i.e. by 6 August 2020).

7       The Defendant did not exercise the option to take over the Flat by the stipulated time but filed SUM 1512 for an extension of time for sale of the Flat. The Plaintiff also filed SUM 2311 similarly seeking an extension of time for sale of the Flat and also various other terms. Subsequently, the Plaintiff modified the terms of her proposed variation in light of correspondence received from the HDB and CPF after filing her application.

8       The Defendant has since found a purchaser for the Flat at the sale price of $610,000 on 18 October 2020. The Plaintiff agreed that the Defendant could proceed with the sale of the Flat at the sale price of $610,000. I was informed at the hearing on 20 January 2021 that the buyer has exercised the option and the final appointment for the completion of the sale is due on 4 March 2021.

## Issues in dispute

9       The variation sought by the Plaintiff is set out at Annex A of the Plaintiff’s written submissions. At the hearing, the Defendant confirmed that he has no objection to sub-paragraphs 1 (i) to (v) of Annex A. These are terms relating to the extension of time and conduct of the sale of the Flat which are uncontroversial since a buyer has been found. Counsel for the Plaintiff suggested that instead of 18 months as stated in paragraph 1 of Annex A that the Flat be sold within 20 months and this was accepted by the Defendant as it does not affect the substance of the disputes.

10     The bone of contention lies in sub-paragraphs 1 (vi) and (vii) which state as follows:

> (vi)  The sale proceeds of the Flat shall be utilized in the following manner:

>> (a)    Payment of the outstanding mortgage loan on the Flat;

>> (b)    Refund to both parties’ CPF accounts of the CPF monies utilized for the purchase of the Flat (with accrued interest); and

>> (c)    Payment of all costs and expenses out of and/or incidental to the sale (including but not limited to agent’s commission, legal fees and disbursements) in the proportion of 50.0% to the Defendant and 50.0% to the Plaintiff.

> (vii) In the event that the sale proceeds are insufficient to pay the requisite CPF refunds to either owner’s CPF accounts upon the sale of the Flat, the Defendant shall be responsible for topping-up the shortfall to both parties’ CPF accounts in cash, and such shortfall shall be topped-up in one lump sum at the time of the completion of the sale. For the avoidance of doubt, the Defendant shall top-up such lump sum to the Plaintiff’s CPF account, regardless of whether the Defendant is required by the CPF Board to top-up the shortfall to the parties’ CPF accounts.

## Plaintiff’s position

11     The basis of the Plaintiff’s proposed variation is that the Consent Order is unworkable as the CPF is unable to effect the refund of the Plaintiff’s CPF monies prior to the refund of the Defendant’s CPF monies. This is because the sale of the Flat is a negative sale and the balance amount is insufficient to make the required CPF refunds in full. The CPF Board indicated that the amount to be refunded to the respective CPF accounts would have to be apportioned based on the following formula:[^1]

>   
| 

Required CPF refund for an individual member

Total required CPF refund for all member

 | 

x

 | 

Balance Amount

 |

  
  

12     The Plaintiff submits that the proposed variation has a rational connection to the identified unworkability, accords with the parties’ intention at the time of entering the Consent Order and gives effect to the Consent Order.

## Defendant’s position

13     At the hearing, the Defendant indicated that he is asking for (a) 50% of the sum of $15,000 which he had paid for the purchase of the Flat and (b) that the parties be responsible for topping up their own CPF accounts.

14     The Defendant’s position is that the Flat was optioned and valued at a negative sale sum of $610,000 and that a break-even sale sum would be an estimate of a sale price of $635,000. Based on the current sale of the Flat at $610,00, the Defendant states that he would incur a loss equivalent to 60 months of his CPF savings. As the negative sale was never discussed at the time the Consent Order was entered into, the Defendant asked that the Consent Order be reconsidered or revised in light of the negative sale. In substance, the Defendant is asking for cl. 1(2) of the Consent Order to be set aside.

## Analysis

15     The applicable principles for the setting aside of a consent order are set out in _Lee Min Jai v Chua Cheow Koon_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 1 SLR(R) 548</span> where the High Court held (at \[5\]) as follows:

> Under s 112(4) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 1997 Rev Ed), the court may “at any time it thinks fit, extend, vary, revoke or discharge any order made under this section, and may vary any term or condition upon or subject to which any such order has been made”. But this section … should not be construed as an invitation to revise the terms of a settlement merely so that they appear more equitable or will be, in fact, more equitable in the objective opinion of the court. Privately settled terms in respect of the ancillary matters in a divorce may not always appear to be fair. But divorce is a very personal matter, and each party would have his own private reasons for demanding, or acquiescing, to any given term or condition in the ultimate settlement. What the court should be alert to, is that one party had not taken an unfair advantage over the other in the course of negotiating and settling the terms…

16     In _Surindar Singh s/o Jaswant Singh v Sita Jaswant Kaur_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGCA 37</span>, the Court of Appeal observed (at \[55\])) as follows:

> … there is judicial recognition that divorce is a very personal matter and there may be private reasons as to why certain concessions were made in reaching a settlement agreement. This was recognised in _Lee Min Jai v Chua Cheow Koon_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 1 SLR(R) 548</span> at \[5\], in the context of whether a consent order should be rescinded …

17     In the present case, there is no evidence to suggest nor has it been alleged that the Plaintiff had taken an unfair advantage of the Defendant in the course of the mediation. The mediation was conducted before a judge-mediator and the Defendant had acknowledged on the draft consent order that he had considered the terms of the agreement and had also been informed of his right to seek independent legal advice.[^2] During the mediation, the Defendant had also proposed amendments to the draft consent order (“DCO”) which were captured in the form of annotations made on the physical copy of the DCO. [^3] In the circumstances, I find no reason to believe that the Defendant had been taken advantage of and to set aside the Consent Order on this basis.

18     In _UMM v UML_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHCF 13</span> (“_UMM_”), Debbie Ong J held (at \[8\]) as follows:

> The power to set aside or vary a consent order on the division of assets under s 112(4) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the Charter”) is to be exercised narrowly. An applicant must prove one of the vitiating factors, or that the order was or has become unworkable: see _AYM v AYL_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 1 SLR 924</span> (“_AYM_”) at \[22\]–\[23\]; _BMI v BMJ and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 43</span> at \[3\]–\[5\]; _Lee Min Jai v Chua Cheow Koon_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 1 SLR(R) 548</span> at \[5\]. While it is possible that unworkability may be due to a fundamental misunderstanding, it must be a fundamental misunderstanding on the face of the order: _AYM_ at \[29\].

19     In the present case, as there are no vitiating factors to set aside cl. 1(2) of the Consent Order, the Consent Order may only varied if it is shown to be unworkable.

20     On this issue, the facts in _UMM_ bear some similarity to the present case. In _UMM_, the parties had entered into a consent order which provided that the Wife shall not be required to refund the Husband’s CPF account for the CPF monies used for the purchase of the flat and the accrued interest and in lieu of such refund, the Wife shall waive her entitlement to claim for her maintenance. The CPF Board sent a letter to the Wife informing her of its objection to the transfer of the flat with no refund to the Husband’s CPF account as the transfer of property with no refund applies only to orders for division of matrimonial assets. The Wife then applied to vary the consent order to remove the express link between the Wife’s waiver of her maintenance claim and the division of the flat. This was done in accordance with the advice of the CPF Board. The court found that the variation was necessitated by the CPF Board’s objection to the terms of the consent order and that the amendment was necessary to give effect to the consent order which would otherwise be unworkable.

21     In the present case, the CPF’s objection to the Consent Order has similarly rendered the Consent Order unworkable_._ There is thus a proper basis at law for cl. 1(2) of the Consent Order to be varied under s 112(4) of the Women’s Charter.

22     This however does not mean that the ancillary matters may be re-litigated in the manner requested by the Defendant. As noted in _UMM_ (at \[15\]):

> … When the court determines a variation application, it does not re-open the original orders with the effect of disregarding the original order which is the subject of the variation application. The Wife’s application for variation does not confer on the Husband a licence to re-litigate the AMs. Instead, in the context of varying a prior consent AM order, the court is generally limited to considering whether the order was unworkable or has become unworkable ….

23     In _TYA v TYB_ \[2017\] SGHCF (“_TYA_”), Valerie Thean J held as follows:

> When an order for the division of matrimonial assets is eligible to be varied under s 112(4) of the Charter, the court ought to **vary the order only to the extent necessary to give effect to the objective of the order**. **The starting point for discerning that objective is the text of the original order. Where the order is a consent order, the text will be of particular importance because it will be presumed to reflect the parties’ intentions at the time they consented to the order.** The variation will accordingly be an exercise in discerning those intentions, having regard to the circumstances in which they were formed, and subsequently giving effect to them in the best possible way. The court should also bear in mind the specific reason or reasons for which the order in question has been found to be unworkable. **The variation which is effected by the court must have a rational connection to the unworkability that has been identified.** This is an important principle for the mere fact of unworkability does not grant the court a carte blanche discretion to rewrite an order on the division of the parties’ matrimonial assets. That would undermine the policy of finality behind s 112 of the Charter. Instead, the variation must address the unworkability which has arisen. **It must represent a solution which goes no further than circumventing the unworkability identified and advancing the objective of the order.**

> \[emphasis in bold added\]

24     It is clear from the above passage that the purpose of the variation is to give effect to the objective of the original order which must, as a starting point, be discerned from the text of the original order. The variation must have a “rational connection” to the unworkability identified and should go no further than circumventing the unworkability.

25     Applying the above principles, it is plain from the text of the Consent Order that the parties’ intention at the time they consented to the order was that the Plaintiff’s CPF monies and accrued interest would be fully refunded to her CPF account whether the Flat was transferred to the Defendant or sold in the open market.

26     This is clear from cl. 1(1)(i) of the Consent Order which provides that “\[u\]pon the Defendant’s exercise of the option to retain the Flat, the Plaintiff shall transfer her interest in the Flat (other than by way of sale) to the Defendant upon the Defendant refunding to the Plaintiff’s CPF account all monies utilised by her plus accrued interest towards the Flat as at the date of the transfer.” Under the Consent Order, the amount of refund is not contingent on the market value of the Flat. If the Defendant had exercised the option to retain the Flat, the Plaintiff would have obtained her full CPF refund regardless of the market value of the Flat.

27     Similarly, cl. 1(2) of the Consent Order provides for the Plaintiff’s CPF account to be refunded in full in the event that the Flat is sold in the open market. The amount of refund is not contingent on the market value of the Flat. Under cl. 1(2)(iv) of the Consent Order, “\[t\]he balance shall be payable to the Defendant”. The effect of cl. 1(2)(iv) is that the Plaintiff will get no more than her CPF refund even if the Flat is sold at a substantial profit.

28     Unfortunately, as it turned out, the Flat was sold at a negative value. Where the sale proceeds are insufficient to refund the parties’ CPF accounts in full, CPF’s regulations require each party to refund their CPF used (plus accrued interest) in proportion to their CPF usage. As a result, the Consent Order is unworkable as the manner of refund set out in the Consent Order (i.e. for the Plaintiff’s CPF account to be refunded first) in inconsistent with the CPF’s requirement for the parties’ CPF accounts to be refunded proportionately.

29     Accordingly, I find that the Plaintiff is justified at law in seeking the variation in terms of sub-paragraphs 1 (vi) and (vii) of Annex A. The variation has a rational connection to the unworkability identified and represents a solution which goes no further than circumventing the unworkability and advancing the objective of the Consent Order, which is for the Plaintiff’s CPF account to be fully refunded.

30     Accordingly, I allowed the Plaintiff’s application to vary cl. 1(2) of the Consent Order in terms of sub-paragraphs 1 (i) to (vii) of Annex A (save that the period of 12 months for the Flat to be sold shall be varied to 20 months) with liberty to apply. In light of my decision in SUM 2311, I made no order on SUM 1512.

31     Having regard to all the circumstances of the case including the fact that the variation was necessitated by the unworkability of the Consent Order, I ordered each party to bear his/her own costs.
