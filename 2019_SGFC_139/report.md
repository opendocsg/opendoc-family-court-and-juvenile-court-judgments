Variation of child maintenance – Section 72 Women’s Charter – Section 127 Women’s Charter

12 December 2019

### District Judge Goh Kiat Yi:

## Introduction

1       This is an application by the Plaintiff mother (“the mother”) against the Defendant father (“the father”) to vary a consent order on child maintenance. I heard the matter on 12 September 2019 and dismissed the application with reasons given. The mother has appealed and I now furnish my full grounds of decision.

## Background Facts

2       Parties have one child to the marriage \[L\] who is 15 years old. They were divorced more than 10 years ago and all the ancillary matters were resolved by way of a consent order dated 22 April 2009 (“the consent order”). [^1] The consent order provides that the mother have sole custody, care and control of L with the father having one weekend overnight access. The father was to pay the mother a nominal monthly sum of $1.00 as maintenance for L. In the present application, the mother seeks to vary the child maintenance from $1.00 to $900.00 and the father to pay half of the L’s tertiary education fees.

## The Applicable Law

3       The applicable legal provision to a variation application is Section 127 read with Section 72 of the Women’s Charter. Section 72 provides that the court may vary an order on proof of change in circumstances or for such other good cause shown to the satisfaction of the court.

4       It was clear from the outset that the application is not a fresh application for maintenance but a variation. It was therefore surprising that the mother’s counsel did not cite the applicable provisions of the Women’s Charter nor any authority on the principles of variation of a consent order in his written submissions. Instead, the only case authority _TBC v TBD_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 130</span> cited under “Applicable law” was a case dealing with a fresh order for maintenance.[^2] When asked by the court, counsel submitted that it is trite law that the relevant test is a material change of circumstances although he was unaware which provision of the Women’s Charter applied.[^3] To my mind, this affected the quality of the mother’s submissions and quality of the evidence presented. This would be evident from my findings below.

## The parties’ cases

5       The mother’s primarily seeks a variation for two reasons. First, the child was 5 years old at the time of the consent order. She is now 15 years old and her expenses have increased drastically. Second, the child expects to commence her tertiary education shortly.[^4] The father resists the application because of his financial difficulties.[^5]

## My findings

#### Change of circumstances

6       The central difficulty of the mother’s case is that she did not state nor provide _any_ evidence on the prevailing circumstances at the time of the consent order. These include key matters such as the child’s expenses, the parties’ financial circumstances, and the reasons for their agreement to nominal maintenance.

7       When asked by the court how can one prove a change of circumstance without considering the original circumstances, counsel submitted that “_this was 10 years ago, and the child’s expenses were not substantial, therefore there was an agreement that \[the father\] would provide only $1.00 and other expenses had to be born by \[the mother\]_.[^6] However, this was not mentioned anywhere on affidavit. When it was clear as the hearing went on that the evidence presented was lacking, counsel sought permission of the court to file a further affidavit to provide information on the financial circumstances of the parties and child’s expenses at the consent order was made.[^7] I rejected the request as it was raised belatedly at the hearing and the mother was duly represented unlike the father.

8       While counsel rightly submitted that it may be difficult for the mother to accurately state her expenses back then or provide sufficient documentary evidence, this did not mean that nothing should be said or provided. All that was mentioned by the mother were “L has grown up and her monthly expenses has increased significantly”[^8] and there is a “significant increase in L’s monthly expenses”[^9]. These were sweeping statements which were bereft of explanation or nor supported by evidence. Importantly, I note that it is not the mother’s position on affidavit that she does not have or is unable to procure such information.

9       It cannot be assumed that the child’s expenses would _necessarily_ increase because he/she has grown up. Different types of expenditure may be incurred at various stages of a child’s life. For example, a younger child may require child-care which could be costly, more clothes due to their growth, additional toys for play and learning, whereas an older child may not or may require less. If it were the case that the child’s expenses have increased because he/she has grown up, such a variation application would have been taken out much earlier.

10     In this regard, I note that the mother’s claimed expenses for the two younger children (to her current marriage) is $3,340. Assuming an equal apportionment, this would amount to $1,670 per child for a 4 and 7 year old. The amount is not far off the $1,834 presently claimed as L’s expenses for a 15 year old. I am mindful that this has to be viewed the cost of living today as opposed to 10 years ago but this clearly illustrates the point that just because a child has grown up does not mean that her expenses would “drastically increase”.

11     Counsel also confirmed that the argument was not one of inflation.[^10] In any event, inflation cuts both ways in that salaries may have increased in tandem. Inflation per se also would not be sufficient, as this would mean that court orders would have to be varied upwards every few years. The point remains that a child being younger _simpliciter_ would not necessarily mean that her expenses would be lesser. It is incumbent upon the mother to prove the change.

12     The mother has also not stated why she had entered into a consent order requiring the father only to pay nominal maintenance. She now believes that the defendant should bear L’s expenses equally, but this only begs the question why she did not seek equal maintenance for the child when the consent order was entered into.[^11] There is nothing to suggest that there was any duress or vitiating factors which rendered the consent order and the underlying agreement defective. In fact the plaintiff was represented by counsel when the consent order was made.[^12]

13     In my judgment, the mother is primarily seeking an upward variation because of the breakdown of her current marriage and ongoing divorce proceedings. She explained that she has to support her two other children as her current husband is not contributing much and she is feeling the strain in finances every month. Her financial liabilities will also increase considerably after the divorce proceedings as she needs to engage a domestic helper to take care of her two young daughters.[^13]

14     This does not amount to a change of circumstances for the following reasons. First, she had remarried and had two children with the knowledge that she has to substantially maintain L as a result of the consent order. It is also not the mother’s case that the remarriage and the birth of her two children were the change of circumstances. This could also not have been so as she would have filed the application shortly after the younger children were born.

15     Second, if the change relates to the financial strain as a result of the ongoing divorce proceedings, the two children’s expenses and her own expenses are issues to be resolved between her and the current husband. In other words, if she needs additional support for her personal expenses and those of the two younger children, the proper person to look to is the current husband not the father.

16     Third, it is not proven if her financial circumstances are really worse off now with the new family and ongoing divorce proceedings, as she has adduced _no evidence_ as to what her financial circumstances were back at the time the order was made. In fact, what is undisputed is that her salary has increased since then.[^14]

17     Counsel cited _TBC v TBD_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 130</span> \[“TBC”\] for the proposition that advocates an equal sharing of financial burden as a starting point. That case is distinguishable as it concerned a fresh maintenance order and not a variation. Second, the underlying basis TBC is Section 68 of the Women’s Charter which provides that it is the duty of both parents to maintain their children. However, the material portion of that provision reads.

> “_Except where an agreement or order of court otherwise provides_, it shall be the duty of a parent to maintain or contribute to the maintenance of his or her children whether they are in his or her custody…” (emphasis in _italics_ mine)

18     There is both an agreement and a consent order of court in the present case which provides otherwise. I pause to observe that the Court of Appeal in _AUA v ATZ_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGCA 41</span> had noted at \[44\] that:

> “… the Courts will not allow a parent to abdicate his/her responsibility of parental support. For that reason, we were careful to state that a _marital agreement_ may be relevant to the question of _quantum_ of support, but not its existence”. Even though s68 of the Charter begins with the phrase \[e\]xcept where an agreement… otherwise provides” a parent cannot contract out of the obligation to provide for his/her child…” (emphasis in _italics_ mine)

19     It is important to note that in the present case the order is for nominal maintenance and not no maintenance. The consent order does not at all question the existence of the father’s duty to maintain the child but rather obliges him to pay only nominal maintenance. This is an issue of quantum. It should also be borne in mind that the Court of Appeal’s observations in _AUA_ were also in relation to upholding of marital agreements rather than varying consent orders.

20     Finally, the mother’s counsel also submitted at the hearing that the father did not dispute the change of circumstances as he did not respond to any of the matters raised by the mother in her supporting affidavit. I disagreed as the father was self-represented and it was clear from his reply affidavit and submissions that he did not address his mind to any of the matters raised by the mother. In fact, he made no mention of the mother’s supporting affidavit at all in his reply affidavit. This did not mean that he had accepted the mother’s evidence.

21     In any event, it is important to note that the burden of proof rests on the mother to show a change of circumstances and the court has to be satisfied on the evidence that the order should be varied. For the reasons given above, I found that she has failed to do so.

#### Good cause

22     For completeness, I also considered the good cause limb even though this not argued by counsel as observed at \[4\] above. The court in _AGV v AGT_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGDC 162</span> observed at \[18\] and \[20\] that:

> _“\[18_\]     _There is no definition of the words “for other good cause being shown to the satisfaction of the court” in Section 72. A perusal of case law shows that in referring to this phrase, the court had possibly (as there is no real case law on point) considered as “good cause”:_

>> _a_)     _whether the parties had a subsequent agreement on the amount of maintenance to be paid notwithstanding the maintenance order made in court (see pp 4- 16 of R1 Lai Ching Kin v Ng Chin Chye <span class="citation">\[2001\] SGDC 228</span>)_

>> _b)_      _whether there was a delay on the enforcing party’s part in seeking enforcement which may signal an ability to do without the maintenance ordered (see pp 13 of R1 Gomez Nee David v Gomez <span class="citation">\[1985\] 1 MLJ 27</span>)_

>> _c_)     _whether there were any circumstances which would affect his ability to pay e.g. that he had to borrow money in order to meet the prevailing maintenance payments (see pp 31 of R1 XZ v YA <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGDC 244</span>)_

> \[_20_\]   _I reiterate that these are not legal principles that have been cast in stone from the cases as cited above; the factors set out are gleaned from the cases referred to and are factors that a court can possibly consider as “good cause”. Naturally a court in making a decision in reliance of this said “good cause” would consider all the circumstances of each and every case before it and each case would have its own particular factual matrix.”_

23     Good cause must also relate to circumstances taking place after the order has been made. See _TPO v TPP_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGFC 82</span>.

24     None of the situations envisaged in _AGT v AGV_ are relevant in the present case. In fact, one of the situations (b) works against the mother as she had only enforced the nominal maintenance order in 2018 some 9 years after the original order was made. This indicates that she could largely support the child on her own and fortifies my view that she is only looking to the father now because of her present divorce proceedings.

25     For the same reasons as observed in relation to the change of circumstances, the mother cannot show any other good cause to vary the order. I reiterate that this was also not a case where the mother had a loss of income, nor has she proven any increase in L’s expenses. We also do not know what the parties’ financial circumstances at the time the order was made and why they agreed to the $1 nominal maintenance order in the first place.

#### The welfare of the child

26     In the interest of L, whilst counsel did raise such an argument, I also considered whether any other circumstances would justify a variation of the consent order. One possible circumstance would be if the child would be left with inadequate provision should the order not be varied. In making such a determination, I considered the reasonable expenses of the child and the present financial circumstances of the mother.

#### The child’s expenses

27     I assessed the L’s expenses as set out in the following table:

29     I accepted the mother’s claim for her share of the two younger children’s expenses in full at $1,456.[^15]

#### The mother’s income

30     As for the mother’s income, she submitted her take home pay to be $5,681.28[^16]. However, her IRAS statements indicate that this amount may be slightly higher, around $5,800 if one considers the average of the IRAS income less the amount which she contributes to CPF. I assessed her nett take home pay to be around $5,700.

31     Based on the foregoing, it appears that the mother still has $2,049 ($5,700-$2,195-$1,456) left after reducing her personal expenses and the expenses to her two younger children. Based on my assessment of the L’s expenses, being $1,585.5, it is clear that she is still able to maintain the child on her own with a surplus of $463.50. This is even allowing in full, claims such as overseas’ holiday expenses, entertainment, hobbies and sports for L.

32     It could not be said that L would be left without adequate support and I was not satisfied that her welfare would be compromised even if the order were not varied.

#### Tertiary school fees

33     The mother had also asked the father to pay half of the L’s tertiary education fees and expenses. The child is presently 15 and attending secondary 3. There is no evidence as to when she will commence tertiary education, if at all, or what institution she may be enrolled. Further, an appropriate amount or apportionment of expenses would also be better assessed taking into account L’s expenses and the parties’ financial circumstances closer to the time of enrolment.

34     The mother’s request was therefore premature and could be considered at an appropriate juncture in the future.

##### Conclusion

35     In the final analysis, it might appear intuitively “unfair” that the father only has to continue paying nominal maintenance for now, I reiterate that the present application is not a fresh application for maintenance. The maintenance payable is a result of the parties’ agreement at the outset and recorded as a consent order. As part of this consent order, orders were also made on issues such as custody and the division of assets. It was fair for parties to be held to their agreement given that L’s welfare would not be compromised. Unless the mother can properly prove a change of circumstance or good cause, it is not for the court to exercise unfettered discretion to vary the order simply because it considers that the father should now contribute more.

36     For the foregoing reasons, I dismissed the mother’s application.
