Family law – Family Violence – Harrassment

17 September 2019

### District Judge Wong Keen Onn:

## Introduction

1       This case involves an application by the Mdm ‘B’ (“referred to as “Complainant”) for a Personal Protection Order (PPO) against her father-in-law ‘C’ (referred to as the “Respondent”). The Complainant alleged that the Respondent had committed incidents of family violence against her by harassing her at her family’s home and through the distributions of insulting and/or offending notices or flyers to members of the public and to other organisations and to the Complainant’s father[^1], namely.

> (i)     typing and sending a letter dated 17 January 2018 to ‘D’ (“Letter of 17 January 2018 to D”)[^2];

> (ii)     harassing the Complainant at her parents’ home on 19 January 2018 at about 5.15p.m.;

> (iii)     distribution by the Respondent of a handwritten letter by him entitled “_Complaint on Ustazah ‘B’_ (“_Complaint about Ustazah ‘B’_ ”) to the possible attendees at the ‘D1’ Academy (the “_AA_”) where the Complainant was scheduled to give a talk at 7.45 p.m. on 20 January 2018 on the topic of “The Woman Islam Taught Me to Be”[^3];

> (iv)     hand delivering a copy of the Letter of 17 January 2018 to ‘D’, together with a copy of the “Complaint about Ustazah ‘B’ sent to Masjid ‘D2’ sometime on or about 21 January 2018 but before 25 January 2018[^4];

> (v)     sending a copy each of the Complaint about Ustazah ‘B’ to the mosques after 20 January 2018[^5];

> (vi)     sending a copy each of the Complaint about Ustazah ‘B’ annotated with and circled the “7 Dosa Dosa ‘B’ to the mosques (“_Annotated Complaint_”)[^6];

> (vii)     sending a further letter to ‘D’ sometime on or after 1 April 2018 and copying it to the Complainant’s father, ‘E’ (“E”) on the same[^7]; and

> (viii)    sending harassing letters to ‘E’ over the period 20 February 2018 to 23 May 2018 with the intention that the same and the contents therein would reach the Complainant[^8]; and

> (ix)     sending a harassing letter dated 13 June 2018 to the Complainant’s brother, ‘’F’ (“F”)[^9].

2       The Complainant called 8 other witnesses to testify on her behalf. The respondent called 3 witnesses to give evidence. The case was heard on 31 October 2018, 1 November 2018, 12 to 13 December 2018, 29 to 31 January 2019, 9 to 11 April 2019 and 18 April 2019. On 9 July 2019, after the conclusion of the trial and after having heard the evidence and the parties’ submissions, I granted a PPO for the Complainant against the Respondent. The Respondent has appealed against my decision and I now set out my reasons which will supplement the brief points which I had delivered on 9 July 2019.

## The law

3       The relevant provision for this application is Section 65(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353). It provides that:

> “The court may, upon satisfaction on a balance of probabilities that family violence has been committed or is likely to be committed against a family member and that it is necessary for the protection of the family member, make a protection order restraining the person against whom the order is made from using family violence against the family member.”

4       The words “family violence” and “hurt” are defined in Section 64 of the Women’s Charter. As the issue in this is one of harassment, paragraph (d) is reproduced below for ease of reference:

> “family violence means the commission of any of the following acts:

>> a)    …;

>> b)    …;

>> c)    ,

>> d)    Causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member,

5       It is settled law that a Complainant must demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, both

> (i)     family violence (or the likelihood of family violence) was committed or likely to be committed against her; and

> (ii)     necessity, namely it is necessary for a PPO be granted to protect the Complainant from the Respondent

6       I now turn to the evidence adduced by the parties and my findings on the evidence.

## The Complainant’s case

7       The Complainant gave evidence that she was a public speaker speaking on topics of Women and Islam and on Women empowerment. The Complainant was also appointed as a Ustazah, a certified and licensed preacher in Islam, and accredited by the ‘D’ (‘D’), the XXX of Singapore[^10]. She had married one ‘F’, who is the Respondent’s eldest son, in August 2013. According to the Complainant, cracks started to surface in her marriage sometime in 2015 after the birth of her second child “H”. Eventually her marriage broke down and on or around 8 January 2018, she took the 3 children with her and left \[address redacted\] and stayed with her parent’s place at \[address redacted\][^11]. The Respondent was working as a private tutor, giving tuition on the Economics subject to students. He was a University graduate and had previously worked as a teacher[^12].

8       Until 8 January 2018, both the Complainant and the Respondent had appeared to have a cordial relationship[^13]. Counsel for the Complainant submitted that “after 8 January 2018, the Respondent carried out a number of harassing acts over a period of time against the Complainant with the intent to cause her embarrassment, hurt, humiliation and more importantly, anguish, and what looked like personal vendetta by the Respondent against the Complainant, for the latter daring to leave ‘G’ and to work and focus on her career as a public speaker instead of being the subservient housewife that the Respondent (and ‘G’) expected the Complainant to be”[^14].

9       A brief summary of the evidence of the Complainant and the more material witnesses for the Complainant were as follows.

## The Complainant’s evidence

10     The Complainant tendered into evidence 4 affidavits CA-1, CA-2, CA-3 and CA-4[^15]. Her evidence was that she was the daughter-in-law of the Respondent. She married the Respondent’s son G (“G”) in August 2013 and then moved in to stay with her husband and the Respondent and Respondent’s wife and her husband’s four siblings at \[address redacted\] (“XXX”). The Complainant and her husband had 3 children of the marriage. The youngest child ‘J’ (“baby”) was born on XXX 2017 and was five months old in XXX 2018.[^16]. Things did not go smoothly between ‘E’ and her from 2015 onwards eventually her marriage, according to her, broke down around 8 January 2018 when she moved out of \[address redacted\] and went to stay at her parents place at \[address redacted\][^17].

#### Initial encounter on 19 January 2019

11     On 19 January 2018 at about 5.30pm, the Respondent came to the \[address redacted\] home after the respondent had made arrangements with her father saying that he wanted to visit her youngest son. When the respondent arrived, she informed him that her father was on the way home to meet him and offered the respondent a cup of tea. All of a sudden, the Respondent started taking photographs of the baby non-stop for about 10 minutes, including when she was carrying the baby[^18]. According to her, this made the baby uncomfortable. When she told the Respondent that the baby was scared, the respondent retorted that this was because of the Complainant. The Respondent shouted at her and called her a liar for not sending the baby to the doctor for treatment for the baby’s skin rash. When asked in cross-examination on their conversation, the Complainant said the Respondent had said words to the effect ““Nobody stopping you from going to the doctor. You’re a liar.”[^19] The complainant was shocked and taken aback and tried to explain that it was her husband ‘G’ and the respondent’s wife who refused to send the baby to the doctor and not her. The respondent then left the flat on his own. Complainant said in cross-examination that she did not ask him to get out of the house[^20] She said she was traumatised about what happened and immediately hid in her room with the baby and cried. She claimed that her brother, ‘F’, was at home inside his room and overheard the incident. Mr ‘F’ did not testify in Court as he was away overseas. She gave evidence that this incident was the start of the Respondent’s continual harassment[^21].

12     In re-examination on the topic of bringing the child ‘J’ to the doctor, Complainant said had have always wanted to bring her 3 children to the doctor but she was not allowed by her husband because her mother-in-law ‘K’ was a firm believer of homeopathy medicine. She had not by the 20 January 2018 brought her baby to see the doctor because she felt that she and her husband should be the ones bringing the baby to the doctor not her father-in-law and her mother-in-law[^22]. As the Respondent had started to send her messages about her baby’s skin reaction (eczema) after she left the \[address redacted\] flat on 8 January 2018, she “blocked” his message in Whatsapp but not in the normal messaging service (sms). She said before she left for 8th January, the Respondent had barely come to meet her with her baby and did not offer to bring the child to the doctor for the last 3 months[^23]. She also wanted to bring the baby to a specialist Dr ‘L’ but the Respondent and his wife wanted to take my baby to Dr. ‘M’ (who deals with natural medication)[^24]. She did not want any interference from her parents-in-law on bringing the child to the doctor. But eventually she did make a trip to fetch the child to see Dr ‘M’ but the clinic was closed[^25]. She did subsequently bring the child later to ‘L’ and ‘L’ clinic sometime in July 2018[^26].

#### First incident

13     Regarding the first incident, the Complaint gave evidence that she was one of the speakers for a forum on 20 January 2018 titled “_The Woman Islam Taught Me to Be: 10 Most Important Lessons to Know by Heart_” to be held at ‘D1’Academy (a religious institution)[^27] which would be at the ground floor of \[address redacted\] [^28]. She organised that event[^29]. She said in her affidavit that on 20 January 2018 at about 7.30pm, while she was on her way to the event venue at \[address redacted\] (‘event venue”), she received a call from her “close” friend and volunteer for that event, one ‘N’ (“N”), (a former student of the respondent for the subject of Economics), who informed her that the Respondent had appeared personally at the venue[^30]. ‘N’ told her that she (‘N’) had approached the Respondent to ask him if he was there to attend the Complainant’s talk but the Respondent ignored her question and instead passed her a piece of paper. She said she was told that “the respondent has been distributing copies of the same piece of paper to the 70 odd forum attendees at the Venue, calling that they were “notes” for the forum[^31]. ‘N’ told her that when she read the contents of the “notes”, ‘N’ was shocked to find that it had nothing to do with the forum but was instead a personal attack on the Complainant. Imam also told her that the Venue owners had chased the respondent out of the Venue upon realising what the “notes” contained[^32]. The Complainant immediately called her mother at about 7.35 pm. At that time, her parents were going to meet her at the Venue to fetch her baby ‘J’ to babysit her while she was at the forum. At that time, her parents were already in the surrounding area of \[address redacted\][^33]. She informed her mother that the Respondent had been seen at the Venue in front of the hall giving out “notes”.[^34]

14     At about 7.40pm, the Complainant arrived at the Venue. On her arrival, her team then showed her the “notes” that the respondent had allegedly distributed to the attendees of the forum. It was a _two piece handwritten note_ by the Respondent on foolscap paper. She said she recognised the Respondent’s handwritings as she is very familiar.[^35]I would refer to the Handwritten note as the ‘”**20 January letter**.” (“20 January letter”)

15     The complainant was shocked to read the Respondent’s handwritten note which consists of harsh lies and damming allegations about her personal life, education, marriage, children and career. _She felt traumatised and humiliated, sad, upset and confused. It was very painful to her and she was fighting back tears_. She did not know how to face the crowd[^36] She had to muster her strength and courage to compose herself especially when the forum was about to begin[^37]. She was badly affected by the Respondent’s handwritten note throughout the forum. When the forum ended, and when she could finally let out her emotions, she cried for half an hour. She said she was so hurt by the contents’ of the Respondent’s _20 January letter (or “hate-letter”)_. She was afraid of what else the Respondent could do. She was also anxious about the impact and the damage caused by the Respondent, especially since all the 70-odd attendees and even passers-by’ had sight of the _20 January letter_. _The contents of the letter were a personal attack on her by the Respondent, intended to caused her much anguish_. The respondent knew she was going to give a talk that evening to a sizeable audience and he intentionally chose to disseminate the “hate-letter” knowing the damage it could cause[^38].

16     The Complainant said that she was so affected on that night of XXX 2018 that she was afraid to even make the commute home on her own after the forum. ‘O’, ‘P’ and ‘Q’ (‘G’s cousins whom she was close to) came after the forum had ended and sent her home[^39]. On 22 January 2018 she made a police report on the incidents of 19 Jan and 20 Jan 2018[^40].

17     In re-examination, the Complainant said she felt “ashamed” as the _20 January letter_ “really said all the bad things about her, for example, her breastmilk was bad which touched on her privacy as a woman. She felt that the Respondent should not be talking about how she was not being a good wife when the Respondent did not really know about her relationship with her husband. She testified that the _20 January letter_ was calculated to embarrass because she gives motivational talk to people, suggesting that she was not fit to a public speaker to lecture about her religion if she could not save her own marriage. She said she thought her work and her personal life were two entirely different things. Just because they say that she was not a good daughter-in-law did not made her a very bad religious teacher or a public influencer[^41]

18     When asked why after seeing the _20 January letter_ she carried on the talk that evening, she explained that “it was a paid talk and have already paid the venue rental and also the refreshments, she decided to be responsible as a motivational speaker to continue with her commitment”[^42].

#### Other incidents

19     On the aspect of continual harassment by the Respondent from 22 January 2018, the Complainant said in her affidavit that on 22 January 2018 she received a call from ‘R’ (CEO of ‘D3’ Institute) (‘R’ or ‘Mr R’) who was her previous employer. ‘R’ informed her that several mosque and event organisers had received a “letter” and had asked him about the contents of the said “letter”. According to Mr ‘R’, they had received the same handwritten note which the Respondent had disseminated at the Venue on 20 January 2018. Mr ‘R’ said that he had also received a call from a representative from ‘D’ on the same day , asking about the content of the “letter”[^43].

20     As she was fearful of what more damage the Respondent would do or could do, she went on 25 January 2018 to lodge an application for a PPO[^44].

21     In court, the Complainant said that from her observation of the video recording made by her mother on 20 January 2018 showed that the 4 ladies walked past the Respondent when he was offering “notes” to passer-bys. The 3rd lady had a piece of paper. The 4 women were walking on the same pavement before the entrance of the venue and they were going towards the hall at the Venue where the talk would be held[^45].

#### Subsequent incidents after 25 January 2018

22     She then narrated on the subsequent incidents after the 25 January 2018 to substantiate why a PPO was necessary. She said that although she was given an EO, the Respondent continued to disseminate the handwritten note to more mosques. The contents of the handwritten note were the same as the one disseminated on XXX 2018 but it was edited to include a title namely ‘_B’: Utizah Palsu, 7 Dosa Dosa ‘B’_ (Translated into English it reads: ‘_B’: Fake ‘B’, 7 Sins of ‘B’_)[^46]. The other incidents included:

> (1)     On 12 February 2018, Mr ‘R’ Shared with her that he received a WhatsApp message (at 3.29 pm) from Ustaz ‘S’ from ‘D4’ Mosque stating that they received a letter (“from the letter box”) stating the contents at page 45 of Complainant’s affidavit[^47]

> (2)     On 13 February 2018, she received a Facebook message (at 1.14 pm) from Ustaz ‘T’ of ‘D5’ Mosque, informing her that they received a letter. The message (captured with a screenshot) shows the same _20 January letter_ by the Respondent and is at page 47[^48].

> (3)     On 14 February 2018, she received a WhatsApp message (at 9.32 am) from Ustaz ‘U’ of ‘D6’Mosque, informing her that “the mosque” received a letter. The message (captured with a screenshot) shows the same handwritten note by the Respondent and is at page 49[^49]

> (4)     On 14 February 2018, Ustaz ‘R’ shared with her that he received a WhatsApp message from Ustaz ‘V’ of ‘D7’ Mosque stating that the mosque just received the letter. The message (captured with a screenshot) shows the same handwritten note by the Respondent and is at **Tab J** at page 53[^50]

> (5)     On 22 February 2018, Ustaz ‘R’ shared with the Complainant that he received a WhatsApp message from his father Ustaz ‘W’ informing her that ‘D8’ Mosque had also received the same letter. This is shown in the WhatsApp message at Tab K pg. 56 (message says he _received from Hj ‘X’ and Hj ‘Y’_)[^51]

> (6)     On 22 February 2018 the Complainant said she received a message from Ustaz ‘Z1’ of ‘D9’ Mosque saying that the Respondent had received 2 copies to the mosque , one by snail mail (stamped mail) on 20 February 2018 and another through the mosque donating box on 23 February 2018.[^52]

23     The Complainant claimed that Respondent sent letters to her own family members, targeting to attack her to cause her anguish. These incidents were:

> (1)     On 20 February 2018 her father received an envelope by post with the handwritten note on foolscap size paper saying “Hello Mr mad dog You are shit. You picked fight with me. Make sure you win,” She claims she recognise the Respondent’s handwriting[^53]

> (2)     And on 3 April 2018, the Complainant’s father received 2 envelopes in the mail, addressed to him. In the envelopes were letters that the Respondent had written to ‘_Z2’_ on 29 March 2018 and to _’D’_ on 1 April 2018. The Complainant said that the contents of the letters clearly targeted her and were intended to cause her humiliation. She said it contained false and damaging statements about her personal life, marriage and her qualifications. She pointed that that the Respondent had claimed she was “sacked in early January 208” which was not true. According to her, it was mutually agreed between ‘R’ and her that she would not renew her contract with ‘D3’ Institute.[^54]

24     She added that on 27 April 2018, her father received another envelope. The Respondent in a letter dated 4 April 2018 referred to an article published by ‘_Z2’_ on 24 March 2018 featuring her. In the letter, The Respondent had make false and damaging statements about her, all of which were intended to and have caused her anguish[^55].

### ‘R’ s evidence

25     In his affidavit[^56], ‘R’, the CEO of ‘D3’Institute(“D3”), stated that the Complainant was not dismissed by XXX as what the Respondent claimed [^57]. They had “mutually agreed that, with the rise of her ability and her reputation in the community, they both felt that it was a good time for the Complainant to part ways with ‘D3’ and also because company’s finances were not good at that time”. He said she continued helping them and working with them and continue accepting invitations to speak at their events.”[^58]

26     ‘R’ stated that on 22 January 2018 he received a call from various mosque and event organisers that they had received a “letter” and they had asked him about the contents of the said “letter”. He gave instances of these in his affidavit and they include messages and phone calls from ‘D’ and a few mosques. They were :

> (1)     One was from the representative from ‘D’ (“D”), Z3, (deputy director or assistant director) on the same day (22 January 2018), asking about the content of the “20 January letter”.[^59]. And in February 12, 14 and 22 of this year, he received messages from various mosques that they had received those letters of Complaint against the Complainant[^60].

> (2)     Later he received a WhatsApp message from Ustaz ‘Z4’ (“Z4”) of ‘D2’ Mosque around 1.23pm on 22 or 23 February 2018 message asked about whether the complainant was still with ‘D3’ as Complainant’s father –in-law (Respondent) raised the issue that “she was dismissed by ‘D3’[^61]

> (3)     He said that he had been informed in person by mosque officer that they have received the “letter” when he went to ‘D9’ Mosque to lead Friday prayers on 23 January 2018, he was told personally that they received a letter, and they showed the same handwritten note by the Respondent (20 January Letter) (exhibit marked as “**T-1**”). He then shared this with the Complainant at about 1.09 pm on that day[^62].

### Evidence of ‘Z5’ (“Z5”)

27     ‘Z5’ (“Z5”) gave evidence as a representative of ‘D2’ Mosque. He was a full-time staff at that mosque[^63]. In his affidavit, he said that sometime after 17 January 2018 but definitely a few days before the Complainant’s talk at ‘D2’ Mosque on 28 January 2018, the mosque received through the letter box a white envelope (with a ‘D10’ logo) addressed to it. He clarified in cross-examination on the witness stand that he _remembered “he received it one week or more before the 28 January 2018” (which would mean the mosque’s staff received the document CA-8 sometime around 21 January 2018)_[^64]. The letter was dropped into the letter box[^65]. The white envelope has a PPIS logo at the left top hand corner and ‘D10’ contact information at the bottom left corner of the envelope. It was addressed to “the Secretary, Masjid ‘’D2’ and there was at the back of the envelope a handwritten note which reads “_note: ‘B’ was dismissed from ‘D3’_. The envelope contained two sheets, the first being a copy of the handwritten letter, photocopies on one sheet of A4 paper on both sides and the _second sheet was a 1-page typewritten letter dated 17Janaury 2018, addressed to ‘D’ (see_ **_Exh CA-8_**_)_. (“**the 17 January Letter**”). The _17 January letter_ was signed off by the Respondent with a contact number and copied to that mosque[^66].

28     In cross-examination, ‘Z5’ confirmed that when he opened the letter, he saw the contents as stated in his affidavit[^67] He could not remember if there are other documents but could not remember if there was another document in the letter.[^68] In cross-examination, he said he pass the envelope and its contents to the Ustazah ‘Z7’ of the XXX Committee because on that weekend the mosque had talk with ‘Ustaz’ ‘B’ and Ustazah ‘Z7’ and her committee had discussed and wanted to hand this over to the Complainant when she arrive to give her talk on 28 January 2018 [^69]. As mentioned earlier, he confirmed the mosque received the envelope and letters marked in _ATM-1_ about “1 week before 28 January 2018” or on 21 January 2018[^70]: He had shown it to ‘R’ when ‘R’ came to the mosque to give prayers and was told by him to keep that “letter”[^71]. When asked by the Respondent whether he would regard the letter as a gossip letter or hate letter, he replied that “it was not-related with the mosque but he regarded it as a hatred letter”_(sic_ hate letter)[^72]

### Evidence of ‘Z8’ and ‘Z9’

29     ‘Z8’, a representative from the XXX Mosque, gave evidence that the ‘D7’Mosque received the Annotated Letter (“20 January letter” with additions eg “Dosa”) (exhibit CA-7) on or about 13 February2018. He referred the matter to the ‘D’ but he did not do the follow up, He also communicated this to ‘R’[^73].

30     ‘Z9’, a representative from Mosque ‘D9’, testified that on or about 20th of February 2018, the mosque received the Annotated Letter through snail mail.

### Testimony of ‘Z10’

31     ‘Z10’, (Mdm ‘Z10’), the Complainant’s mother, testified that at around 7.35 pm, she received a call from the Complainant who said that she was on the way to the Venue and had received a call from her friend Imam who had informed her (the Complainant that the Respondent was at the Venue giving out a letter about the Complainant. At about this time, she and her husband were in the car at the surrounding area of \[address redacted\]. They were looking for a parking lot and son found a lot at \[address redacted\]. From inside their parked car, they could see the respondent by the road side in front of the Venue distributing papers to whoever was passing by or getting out of taxis or Grab[^74]. She was cross-examined as to what she did earlier. She replied that she went for a few minutes of prayers (which was then at 5.15 pm) and left. She and her husband ‘E’, did not “_ikut imam_”, “which meant that she did follow the whole procedures but just did their own prayers” [^75].

32     Mdm ‘Z10’ said in her affidavit that she noticed the Respondent was holding a blue plastic bag on his hand and there were a few pieces of paper on top of the bag. The Respondent was giving out the papers he had placed on top of the blue plastic bag. She also noticed he took out more papers from the blue plastic bag whenever he had finished distributing those on top. She then went out of the car to take one of the papers that the Respondent was giving out as she wanted to know what the Respondent was actually distributing. She approached the Respondent from the back. As the Respondent was busy handing out the papers, she was able to escape his direct notice and managed to take a copy of the said paper from the Respondent for herself. (The copy that she received from the Respondent was produced as HZ-1 at page 4 and 5 of the affidavit **CHZ-1**. That letter is the same as that exhibited at page 33 of the Complainant Affidavit dated 21 June 2018). Upon returning to the car, she gave the paper to her husband who read it with her[^76]. When asked how many people took the pieces of handout from the Respondent, the witness Mdm ‘Z10 said she saw 6 persons taking the pieces of paper given out by the Respondent[^77].

33     Whilst reading the paper, she looked up and noticed that the Respondent had moved to the pavement next to their parked car. She informed her husband of this and her husband asked her to take a video recording of the Respondent distributing the paper as evidence. She took the video clip using her mobile phone and the video clip and the transcription is reproduced in her husband’s (‘E’s) affidavit dated 2 August 2018 (para 7 to 9 and pages 4 to 5 of **CHZ-1**). [^78]The recording time on the mobile phone video showed that the recording was made at about 7.43 p.m. on 20 January 2018[^79]

34     In cross-examination, she said her daughter the Complainant and her 2 sons attended ‘D11’intuition from primary to secondary school (pg 167, 168. She (‘Z10’) said she went to fetch the Complainant but the Complainant went in the second car with ‘O’ and ‘P’ ( ‘G’s cousins) and ‘Q’ and they were right behind her. She denied the Respondent claim that para 30 (of the Complainant) that her version is false. According to her, the 3 witness were not there to attend the talk. They were not helpers in the talk. They were there to coax her daughter, the Complainant[^80].

35     When asked why the video clip was short, she replied that the Respondent was walking towards them in the car and so they stopped recording. She confirmed that video clip showed that the Respondent was giving a paper to someone The words “evidence, evidence, evidence” was uttered by ‘E’, her husband[^81]

### Video Recording

36     The video recording made by Complainant’s mother at the Venue using her hand phone on 20 January 2018 at about 7.43 pm was admitted in evidence as the Respondent (and his counsel) did not dispute the authenticity or the accuracy of the recording. The 6-seconds video recording was played in Court. It showed that on that day, 20th January 2018, at 7.43 pm that the Respondent initially was standing with his back to the camera and Respondent was holding some papers in his hand and a plastic bag and 4 ladies attired in Muslim garb walking past the Respondent. They were walking on the pavement towards the hall at the Venue. Three of them were shaking their heads and the Respondent followed all four of them for a short distance. Towards the end of the video, the Respondent turns then he turned back so that his right side faces the camera[^82].

## Evidence of ‘N’ (“N”)

37     ‘N’ (“N”) gave evidence in her affidavit CNI-1 that on 20 January 2018, she saw the Respondent appeared at the entrance of ‘D1’Academy at \[address redacted\] (‘the Venue”) at around 7.30 pm[^83]. She was part of the registration team for the event and was there at the venue early. She recognised the respondent as he was previously her economics tutor and she was also aware that the Respondent is the Complaint’s father-in-law. Imam approached the Respondent as she was surprised to see him there. She greeted him and asked him if he was there to attend the Complainant’s talk as the “Venue” (the “Event”). The Respondent response to her was whether she “know that ‘B’ is here without her husband’s permission and that she is going through a divorce”. ‘N’ then told the Respondent “Mr Mushy please stop it” as she did not want him to go on and on. At the same time, while they were talking, the Respondent took out a piece of paper from a blue plastic bag that he was holding and handed a copy of it to her. ‘N’ took the paper from him as it was a natural response and she went into the Venue[^84].

38     When she went inside the Venue she read the paper as it was dark outside. The paper was the same as that exhibited at page 33 of the Complainant’s Affidavit. A copy of the paper that the Respondent had handed to her on 20 January 2018 is exhibited at Nl-1 at page 4 and 5 of her affidavit (“**CNI-1**”) _(“20 January letter”)._ ‘N’ retained that paper and gave it to the Complainant when she (the Complainant) arrived at the Venue[^85]. ‘N’ was shocked at the contents written on the paper as the said contents had nothing to do with the Complainant’s talk but was a personal attack on the Complainant. She cried and told ‘Z11’, another friend was there with her. She informed the owners of the Venue, who then told the respondent to move away from Venue. Imam then at about 7.30 pm on that day 20 January 2018 made a telephone call to the Complainant to inform her that the Resident had appeared at the entrance of ‘D1’ Academy and informed her about what had happened and what she had read[^86].

39     After making the call, ‘N’ when taking registration of the attendees, also saw the respondent was handing our more papers from his blue plastic bag to attendees who were walking into or towards the Venue. She did manage to see, but not all the time, the Respondent distributing the papers outside the Academy venue[^87]. While waiting for the Complainant to arrive, ‘Z11’ and she decided that they should do damage control by collecting from the attendees the papers that the respondent had given to them. The papers that she and ‘Z11’ had collected were the same as that the Respondent had given to her (‘N’).”[^88]. They managed to collect back about 30 to 40 such letters, “_the 20 January letter_” and “destroyed all of them except for 1 paper to show as they did not want anyone to pick up to try to read it”.[^89]

40     In cross-examination, she totally disagreed with the Respondent’s versions in which he claimed he came at 7.40 pm, that he told her that he was here to meet the manager of the Academy, that he told her that the Complainant was going for a divorce, that she did not see seeing the Respondent distributing my papers to members of the public, and that he was lying about destroying the papers that she and ‘Z11’ collected [^90].

### ‘E’s evidence

41     ‘E’(“E”) gave evidence that the Respondent had made arrangements to come to his house at \[address redacted\] on 19 January 2018. He received a call that the Respondent was at his house. He asked the Respondent to wait for him. But when he returned home on that day, the Respondent had left. His evidence on 20 January 2018 were consistent and corroborated the Complainant’s mother’s evidence (Mdm ‘Z10’). He said that he had been on the receiving end of several letters from the Respondent, one on 20 February 2018 he received. His evidence was also consistent with the Complainant’s evidence on letters received on 3 April, 10 April, 27 April, 23 May 2018[^91]

## Respondent’s case

### Evidence of the Respondent

42     The Respondent said he went to see the Complainant at the \[address redacted\] on 19 January 2018 at 5.30 pm as his sole purpose was to see the baby. When he was there, the Complainant offered him coffee but he declined. He took some picture of the baby to show his irritated skin and told her to bring the baby to the doctor and suggested that his wife accompany the baby to which the Complainant agreed. Thereafter the Complainant then insisted that this was possible as her husband would not allow this. She got angry and told him to leave the house and chased him out.

43     As for the incident on 20 January 2018, he said he saw the poster on the notice board at ‘D1 Academy (AA) that advertised that the Complainant was giving a talk there. He was deeply affected by the poster as he felt strongly against the Complainant using the religious platform to educate other Muslims when she did not practice what she preached. He decided to approach the organiser of the event, the manager of AA and wanted him to re-consider the choice of the speaker and also to request his urgent assistance in persuading the Complainant to bring the baby to the doctor. He then wrote a letter to him which included all he main points that he wanted to impress upon the manager so as to persuade the Complainant.

44     He then headed off to the AA to pass it to him. He made 5 copies for safekeeping. When he met the organiser, he had a long talk with him when he passed him the handwritten letter. He told the manager that he was the Complainant’s father-in-law and expressed his concern for his grandson and that the Complainant was not-cooperative and refused to take the baby to the doctor and also did not allow anyone else to do so. When he was there at AA, he bumped into his relative and 2 former students. They enquired about his purpose of attendance at the talk cared to women. He passed a total of 3 copies of the letter to them and explained to them that he was trying to convince the Complainant to bring the baby to the doctor and had hoped that they could persuade the Complaint to do so. He said he gave out 4 copies but he did not distribute the letter widely to the audience of about 70 people as stated by the Complainant. He denied that the letter he gave out was a “hate letter” and it was not distributed to students, public and strangers. He denied distributing the above-mentioned letter/flyer to the Complainant’s students and members of the public[^92].

45     He denied that he disseminated the edited handwritten letter (with words on it) to the mosques and other institutions He said it was possible that these were disseminated by her critics in order to express their displeasure towards the Complainant[^93]

46     In cross-examination, he revealed that his wife Madam ‘K’, was a member of ‘D10’ (“D10”) and had resigned some time ago and she did receive and still receives ‘D10’ subscription letters in these envelopes similar to that in CA-8 (that was received by ‘D2’ Mosque). He agreed he had used a similar ‘D10’ envelope to send out a letter to The Complainant’s father because there are many lying in my house. He did use ‘D10’ envelopes to send out official letters that I wanted to, but denied sending anything in such an envelope and letter to ‘D2’[^94]

### Evidence of ‘K’

47     ‘K’ (Complainant’s mother –in-law and Respondent’s wife) (“K”) did not witness the circulation of the offending letter (20 January 2018). However, she was called as a witness to give evidence of the Complainant’s alleged bizarre behaviour in 2015 and her current relationship with the Complainant. She was a qualified homeopathy practitioner and that she was concerned that the Complainant had chosen to give fried food and poor diet to the baby and not allow the baby to receive insufficient medical attention (see “RA-3”).

48     In cross-examination, she admitted that she was still also a member of ‘D10’, and receive subscription letters from ‘Z13’ once a year. She had received the smaller ‘D10’ envelopes (same as the Exhibit CA-8) some 10 years ago or more because she was a vice president then about 12 years ago. She was the one in charge with newsletters. She conceded that she had those ‘D10’ envelopes lying around her house which she used for sending out letters because she was in charge of the membership also. Although the Respondent had used a 60th Anniversary ‘D10’ envelop to send a letter to the Complainant’s father in April 2018 (page 68 and 69 of CA-1), she denied ever seeing such an envelope[^95].

49     In cross-examination, she admitted the 17 January letter was written by your husband. Before it was sent out, Mdm ‘Z10’ saw this letter 17th of January before. The Respondent had emailed to her for her to vet before he printed it out and signed it[^96]. She now disagreed with the contents of the 17 January letter such as the sentence about the Complainant having only O levels. She confirmed that the Complainant has a diploma as she had seen the diploma before[^97]. She also admitted that the sentence that “_I (Respondent) note that she has very different views on women in Islam_” did not come from the Respondent but came from her and the daily interactions the Respondent had with the Complainant was mainly exchange of pleasantries like “Hello”, “Hi”, “How are you?”. On how the Respondent could have known of the Complainant’s view on Islam, she did not know of other interactions the Respondent had with the Complainant. ‘K’ also said she did not approve of some of the Complainant’s talks because the Complainant was doing some counselling even though ‘K’ herself neither do counselling nor attend any counselling courses and because in the earlier years, the Complainant was not so experienced. She knew that the Complainant’s husband did object to the Complainant’s talks even though the husband did not attend any of the Complainant’s talks. ‘K’ herself did not attend any of the Complainant’s talks. She also testify that having known of the contents of the 17 January letter, she did not want to send the letter under her name[^98].

### Evidence of ‘Z12’

50     ‘Z12’, one of the Respondent’s daughter, said in evidence that her father (the Respondent) never wrote hate notes.

## Evidence of ‘G’

51     ‘G’ was the Complainant’s husband. He did not witness the incident at \[address redacted\] and he was not aware of the 20 January letter and other letters. He testified as to the state of the relationship with the Complainant and the issue of bringing the baby to see the doctor.

52     In cross-examination, he confirmed that the Complainant had she has 2 diplomas and that she was accredited by ‘D’.[^99] He said that the Complainant had left him (and took the children with her) 5 times during the course of the marriage (this contrasted with the Respondent’s evidence that he ((father) father only knew one other occasion)[^100]. As for the issue of bringing the baby to see the doctor, he initially said that he had no idea that his father (Respondent) had insisted that the Complainant had to take baby to Dr. ‘M’. He testified that he would be agreeable to any doctor. Counsel for the Complainant then confronted him with his own evidence at paragraph 53 of his affidavit RA-5 wherein he had said “_On 15th January 2018, I informed her that I wanted to bring a---‘J’ to Dr. ‘M’. She refused this request and informed me she will bring him to the doctor by herself instead. She also stated that Dr. ‘M’ is not a Paediatrician_”. He then agreed that he had wanted to take ‘J’ to Dr. ‘M’ and tried to explain away the contradiction by saying that he assumed this as he had asked her which doctor she was going to bring the baby to[^101]. He said in his second affidavit RA-6 at paragraph 15 that he believed that Complainant had filed the PPO application to use it against him in her divorce in the Syariah Court.

## Complainant’s submissions

53     Briefly, the counsel for the Complainant submitted[^102] that the Respondent has committed the said harassing acts namely:

> (i)     typing and sending a letter dated 17 January 2018 to Islamic Religious Council of Singapore, ‘D’ (“Letter of 17 January 2018 to ‘D’”);

> (ii)     harassing the Complainant at her parents’ home on 19 January 2018 5;

> (iii)     distribution by the Respondent of a handwritten letter by him entitled “Complaint on Ustazah B” (“Complaint of Ustazah B ”) to the attendees at the ‘D1’Academy (the “AA”) where the Complainant was scheduled to give a talk at 7.45 p.m. on 20 January 2018 on the topic of “The Woman Islam Taught Me to Be”;

> (iv)     hand delivering a copy of the Letter of 17 January 2018 to ‘D’, together with a copy of Complaint of Ustazah ‘B’sent to Masjid ‘D2’ sometime on or about 21 January 2018 but before 25 January 2018;

> (v)     sending a copy each of the Complaint of Ustazah ‘B’ sent to the mosques after 20 January 2018;

> (vi)     sending a copy each of the Complaint of Ustazah ‘B’ annotated with and circled the “7 Dosa Dosa B” to the mosques (“Annotated Complaint”);

> (vii)     sending a further letter to ‘D’ sometime on or after 1 April 2018 and copying the Complainant’s father, ‘E’ (“E”) on the same; and

> (viii)    sending harassing letters to ‘E’ over the period 20 February 2018 to 23 May 2018 with the intention that the same and the contents therein would reach the Complainant;

54     According to counsel, the Respondent’s explanation for having carried out the aforesaid acts was that he was concerned for the Complainant’s 4 month old baby, who had skin rashes at that time, and that he was allegedly trying to get the Complainant to take the baby to the doctor, “_any doctor_” for his skin rash. In response to this, counsel for the complainant submitted that that cannot be true and could not be a justification for doing so. Counsel for the Complainant further submitted that the said harassing acts of the Respondent were “vindictive, and, meant to harass the Complainant”. The Complainant also said that the said acts were certainly _not_ carried out by the Respondent for the primary purpose of getting the Complainant to take the baby to the doctor but were meant to cause maximum anguish, humiliation and embarrassment to the Complainant, and all because the Complainant held different views and beliefs from him. According to her, although she (the Complainant) also obtained an expedited order (EO) for herself against the Respondent, the Respondent continued to harass her, by sending out, sometime in or about February 2018 to various mosques, a copy each of the **Annotated Complaint**. (Court will refer to the 20 January letter with added circling marks and comments as the “**Annotated Complaint**”)

55     She said that the Respondent was aware of the EO as the Respondent’s son had admitted in the witness stand that he had informed the Respondent that there was an expedited Order. She also argued that the subsequent letters that were sent to the Mosques were done by the Respondent as the circles and the words “dosa” had appeared on the letter and the same list is similar to those circled by the Respondent in the **annotated Complaint**. Further, the Respondent continued to write and send letters to the Complainant’s father, ‘E’ (“CAI-1 E ”), from 20 February 2018 to 23 May 2018. The Complaint argued that said letters were written not just for ‘E’ but also meant for the Complainant to read.

56     The Complainant submitted that the Respondent’s version that he arrived just outside the Venue (address redacted) at about 7.40 pm, that he only brought 5 copies of the letter, and that he had a 20-minute conversation with Ustaz ‘Z14’ were all **not** true. According to the Complainant, the Respondent was making up evidence of the witness box and his version were inconsistent with his video recording and the eye witness accounts. She submitted that the Respondent was therefore lying through his teeth when he insisted that he gave the said complaint to the said twins ‘O’ and ‘P’ and Dr ‘Q’ on 20 January 2018 at between 7.45 p.m. to 8.05 p.m. This was inconsistent with his wife’s (‘K’) testimony who said the twins, ‘O’ and ‘P’, and Dr ‘Q’ were at a cousin’s party at a different location in \[address redacted\]. According to the Complainant, the Respondent did not meet ‘O’ and ‘P’ at all and he had to make up the evidence so that he could dispel the actual fact that he was caught giving out the said complaint to many of the attendees of the talk given by the Complainant at the AA that evening. (_para 54, to 61 of Complainant’s written submissions_). Counsel also submitted to the Court to reject the bare assertion that these letters that were sent to the Mosque on 21 January 2018 to XXX mosque was done by the Complainant or the Complainant’s brother to frame him up as there was no supportive evidence to substantiate this allegation[^103].

57     Counsel urged the Court to construe the Respondent’s action of distributing multiple copies of the Complaint of Ustazah ‘B’as multiple harassing acts notwithstanding the same being carried out in proximity of time and location, as the same was being distributed to different individuals. Counsel submitted that this was akin to criminal charges where there are joinder of offences[^104].

58     The Complainant’s counsel submitted that right from 17 January 2018, the intention of the Respondent was to stop the Complainant from giving public talks and if that did not work, to cause her public humiliation such that she would have no choice but to stop giving talks. She submitted that the Respondent’s insistence that his only reason for which he wrote the said complaint was his concern for ‘J’s skin condition cannot be true[^105].

59     In conclusion, counsel submitted that on a balance of probabilities, based on the evidence given at trial and from the affidavits of evidence in chief, family violence was committed by the Respondent on the Complainant. She urged the Court to issue a personal protection order against the Respondent in favour of the Complainant with costs[^106]

**The Respondent’s submissions**

60     The Respondent’s case was a denial of these incidents (and that he did not circulate these Letters). His main submissions (as for the other points, I did not reproduce/narrate them here as they are found in the written submissions) can be summarised as follows:

> (1)     The Respondent denied the Complainant’s allegations that he circulated the Annotated letter to mosques in Singapore. He said the Complainant’s allegations was just a “bare allegation” based on arguments that there were similarities in the handwriting between the annotations and the Respondent’s admitted handwriting. However, the Complainant is unqualified to make such comparisons and no handwriting expert was called[^107]

> (2)     The alleged acts would amount to a statutory tort under the Protection from Harassment Act (“POHA”) and therefore the Complainant ought to seek relief (if any) under the POHA and not for a Personal Protection Order (PPO)[^108]

> (3)     Third, the act of distributing the letter on 20 January 2018 at the ‘D12’ Academy was an isolated incident and does not constitute harassment as not every act which causes some unhappiness or irritation to a complainant constitute harassment. The Respondent claimed that the Complainant admitted that the Respondent had distributed the letter at XXX due to his concern for the baby. (para 1.8 to 1.12 of RS-1). He also said he gave the papers /letter to 3 persons who were his ex-students, two of whom were his relatives ‘O’ and ‘P’.

> (4)     As for ‘N’, he asked the Court to reject her evidence as he claimed that Imam is an interested party as she is lying for the Complainant as she believes it was her religious duty. Respondent claims ‘N’ could not have seen him distributing the papers from the inner glass door as it was dark outside and the short passage way from the front door to the glass door is too narrow to get her an angle to see outside. He also claimed that she was busy with her registration to go out to see what the Respondent was doing. (para 7.10 of RS-1)

> (5)     Respondent claimed that it was suspicious that the Complainant did not tell the police that there are 2 CCTVs cameras along the corridor of \[address redacted\] and that it is the practice of the police to ask for CCTVs.”[^109]

## My Decision

61     The evidence that are not in dispute can be summarised as follows:

> (1)     It is not disputed that the Complainant is a “family member” as the Complainant is the daughter-in-law of the Respondent.

> (2)     It is not in dispute that the Respondent write the **20 January letter** (“letter CA-1”). He admitted to this in his affidavit and in his testimony.

> (3)     He admitted he also wrote, through the help of his wife, the **17 January Letter** (complaint letter to ‘D’) was written by him and he had sent a letter to ‘D’ directly complaining about the Complainant

> (4)     He had intended to issue this to certain persons to inform them of the contents of the letter. He had at least admitted to distributing it on 20 January 2018 to 3 persons. I will deal at a later point on whether the evidence supports his position that he only distributed not more than 3 copies on that evening

> (5)     He admitted the letter attached to the letter to XXX Mosque which the mosque received on or about 21 January 2018 was a copy of the **17 January Letter** (the same letter he had written to ‘D’)

> (6)     It is also not in dispute that he (Respondent) was (captured) in the video recording taken by Mdm ‘Z10’ at about 7.43 pm (that night) and it (recording) showed him approaching passers-by at \[address redacted\] and attempting to distribute some papers.

62     As for the other evidence (and after my assessment), I find the Complainant, Mr ‘R’, ‘N’, Mdm ‘Z10’ and ‘E’ to be credible witnesses and they were forthright in their testimony. Some of their evidence were corroborated by the objective evidence e.g the video recording (on the time the Respondent was near the vicinity of the Venue and that he was trying to distribute notices (20 January letter) to the public and their evidence were consistent with each other. I accepted their evidence. I also accepted the evidence that the Respondent was at \[address redacted\] and was seen by Mr ‘E’, Mdm ‘Z10’ to be approaching passers-by who were going to the talk on that evening and distributing the letters. I also accept that the respondent had also given such a letter to ‘N’ and to Mdm ‘Z10’ on that night.

63     I did not find the Respondent to be a credible witness as his testimony was inconsistent and was contradicted by the objective evidence such as the video recording of him on 20 January 2018 at 7.43 pm. The Respondent had claimed when he reached the Venue at 7.40 pm, he went straight to look for Ustaz ‘Z14’ to speak to him and he spent about 10 minutes. His version was totally contradicted by the video recording as he was seen distributing the 20 January Letter (notices) in public at 7.43 pm. I also accept the Complainant’s arguments that the Respondent was prevaricating in the witness stand when he testified that he met and gave the 20 January letter to the said twins ‘O’ and ‘P’ and Dr ‘Q’ (who was earlier parking the car) on 20 January 2018 at between 7.45 p.m. to 8.05 p.m[^110]. This was inconsistent with his wife’s (‘K’) testimony and his son’s (Complainant’s husband’s) testimony who said the twins, ‘O’ and ‘P’, and Dr ‘Q’ were at a cousin’s party at a different location in \[address redacted\] at that same time. In actual fact, the Respondent did not meet ‘O’ and ‘P’ at all and he had to make up the evidence so that he could dispel the actual fact that he was caught giving out the said complaint to many of the attendees of the talk given by the Complainant at the Venue AA that evening. Also, I find his paragraph 36, 37, to 39, 40, 42, 57 to 58 about only distributing 4 copies to the owner of the venue, a relative, and 2 former students were not true. First, if he had wanted to “make 5 copies for safekeeping” as in para 42 of his affidavit RA-1, then there was no reason for him to distribute all the copies (1 was taken by the Complainant’s mother). Two, he claimed the main purpose was to convince the owner of the venue to persuade the Complainant to bring the baby to see the doctor, and there was no justifiable reason make the other disparaging remarks about the Complainant, her beliefs and her personal matters such as “bad breastmilk”, her lack of qualifications etcetera. There was also no reason or logic to distribute the 20 January letter to other people such as Imam. Three, based on his version, he had given out 5 copies, and if it was true that he only had so few copies, then it flies in the face of logic that he was distributing letters/notices to the members of the public at 7.43 pm. The only reasonable and logical inference was that he had brought many more copies of the 20 January letter and distributed nearly 30 to 40 copies to the public and ‘N’and ‘Z11’ had to subsequently collect from the attendees these notices to do some “damage control”

64     As for the letter to ‘D2’, I accept the only reasonable inference from the evidence was that the Respondent had either sent or caused the 20 January Letter and the 17 January Letter to be sent to the ‘D2’ mosque. By 21 January 2018, the only person who had the 17 January letter was the Respondent. He was the one who produced and signed it. He did not dispute that the letter was signed by him. This 17 January letter was not distributed to anyone (except 1 sent to ‘D’ on or about 17 January 2018). I did not accept the Respondent’s allegation that this was done by the Complainant or the Complainant’s brother Mr ‘F’ in “an attempt to frame the respondent” as it was a bare allegation that was made at such late day in the trial and was not substantiated by any credible evidence. Moreover, the two letters were sent in a ‘Z13’ envelope that was available in the Respondent’s house and he admitted he had used such envelopes before to send out letters. On a balance of probabilities, he was the person who sent it or caused for it to be sent to the mosque.

65     As for the contents of the 20 January Letter, the Complainant and Mr ‘R’ clearly said that this was to embarrass the Complainant. The Complainant herself had testified that she felt harassed and anguished by the circulation of the letter that was a personal attack on her before the dates that she gave talks. I also find the Respondent’s intention of sending the 17 January letter to ‘D’ and the 17 January and 20 January letters to the management at ‘D2’ mosque (the venue of where the Complainant’s forthcoming talk was scheduled) was meant to publicly embarrass the Complainant and spread and disparaging, and inaccurate information (without any credible basis) about the Complainant and her views and qualifications so as to stop her from giving talks. That in my view amounted to harassment.

66     Looking at these 3 incidents, the distribution (of the 20 January Letter) to attendees or passers-by at \[address redacted\], the 17 January Letter that he had sent to ‘D’ before 25 January 2018 and the envelope/letter to ‘D2’ mosque containing the 20 January Letter and the 17 January Letter (the complaint letter and the copy of the letter to ‘D’) (handed on or about 21 Jan 2018), I find that it was sufficient to amount to a persistent conduct by the Respondent to harass the Complainant. Simply put, the Respondent’s acts amounted to continual harassment.

67     I also found that it was necessary to issue a PPO as the Complainant needed protection from the Respondent from continuing his course of conduct in harassing her. There was no dispute that after the EO was issued and after the filing of the PPO application, the Respondent continued to write disparaging letters attacking the Complainant’s character about to the Complainant’s father knowing that it was likely that this would be convey to the Complainant as she was living at her father’s place.

68     After considering all the evidence made available to me during the trial, and the totality of the circumstances of this particular case, I found that on a balance of probabilities, family violence had been committed by the Respondent against the Complainant. I also found that it was necessary for a PPO to be issued for the protection of the Complainant. I therefore issued a PPO against the Respondent for the Complainant

## Costs

69     The Complainant had succeeded in her application and therefore the usual costs would follow the event. The hearing took 11 ½ days including 1 day for submissions and ½ day for the delivery of the decision. I assessed costs for the first day to be about $1,600 and $1,200 for each of the other 9 hearing days, $800 for the day for submissions and $300 for attendance for delivery of the decision. I therefore ordered the Respondent to pay to the Complainant costs fixed at $13,500 including disbursements. The Respondent has filed a notice of appeal.
