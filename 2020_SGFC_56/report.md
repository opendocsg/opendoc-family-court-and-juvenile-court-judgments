Family Law – Personal Protection Order Domestic Exclusion Order

Section 65 Women’s Charter Cap.353

22 June 2020

### District Judge Muhammad Hidhir Bin Abdul Majid:

## Introduction

1       This was an application for a personal protection order (“PPO”) and a domestic exclusion order (“DEO”) under the Women’s Charter made by the complainant (“mother”) against the respondent (“son”) who is also her only child, for acts of family violence allegedly committed by him on the mother.

2       The son resisted the mother’s application. At the end of the hearing, I granted the mother a PPO as well as a DEO for the whole premises.

3       The mother had left the premises for some time after making a police report and was staying with her brother. To enable the son to move his personal belongings out of the premises, I ordered the DEO to take effect 2 weeks from the date of the order. The son has appealed against the orders made.

## The parties

4       The mother aged 75 year old is a retiree whilst the son aged 35 years is a commodity trader.

5       The mother is the owner of the premises, a 5-room Housing and Development Board flat, whilst the son is an occupier. The incidents were alleged to have taken place at the flat where only both of them were residing as the mother’s husband had passed away.

## The parties’ cases

### The mother’s evidence

6       In support of her application, the mother prepared a bundle of documents wherein she set out, _inter alia_, her written account of the five incidents wherein acts of violence were allegedly committed against her. Her bundle also comprised of photocopies of photographs, including those of the injuries she claimed to have suffered from one of the incidents[^1]. The documents were admitted without any objection raised by the son who had also sought to admit a set of documents including photocopies of photographs which were also admitted without any objection raised by the mother[^2].

### 1st incident [^3]

7       This took place on 8 January 2019 at about 8 in the morning. Both the mother and son had returned from a holiday in the Maldives and had an argument about something trivial which she was unable to recall what the issues were. The son was extremely rude and shouted at her. Arising from that, she told him that if he was not happy, he could leave the house.

8       The son walked away from her, after which she suddenly felt a hard kick from behind on both her legs. When she asked him why he had kicked her, his reply was that it was because she had knocked down his water bottle that was on the floor but which was still standing upright.

9       Later in the afternoon, she felt that both her legs were very painful and swollen. She then went to the Clementi Mall where she asked a lady who was in the toilet to help her take photographs of the bruises using her hand phone[^4]. She felt very depressed and sad due to what her son did to her but did not make a police report because she had forgiven him and did not want to create further trouble which could affect his career. She also felt that she should give him a chance for him to change. After this incident, they did not talk for a few days.

### 2nd incident [^5]

10     This took place a few days after the 1st incident at about late morning. The mother and her son were both in the living room. Her son became angry with her about something which she could not recall. His son was berating her but she kept quiet while he continued to berate her. Then, out of the blue, he took out a metal hanger and hit her face with it. She managed to turn her face away causing the metal hanger to hit her upper lip, causing a bruise. She did not make a police report as she again, had wanted to give him a chance to change. She felt very sad and depressed over the incident.

### 3rd incident [^6]

11     This took place sometime in the afternoon on a day in either February or March 2019. Her son was in the kitchen while she was in the hall watching television. He was telling her something which she did not hear. He then came out of the kitchen with a bottle of cooking oil, poured it on her body and then walked away. It was so sudden that she did not manage to react. He then went back to the kitchen as if nothing had happened. She again did not make a police report and forgave him as she thought he may be very stressed in his work. She again wanted to give him a chance to reflect and think. She cried in her head and even asked God why he treated her so badly.

### 4th incident [^7]

12     This took place on 30 November 2019 at about 2 o’clock in the morning when they were both on their own beds in the master bedroom. She thought the son had dozed off when the television was still on. When she asked him to switch off the television, he replied that if she were to ask him again, he will leave the television on until the morning. She ignored him and went to the toilet. After she returned to her bed, her son took a bottle that was filled with water and poured the water over her head. He thereafter went to the toilet to take a cup of water and again poured the water over her head. As she was drenched, she took a towel to dry herself. She added that she did not fight back as it was the early hours of the morning and she was not physically hurt. She decided to let it pass to give him another chance to repent. She also felt helpless and blamed herself for how he has turned out to be.

### 5th incident [^8]

13     This took place in the evening of 1 Dec 2019. Both of them did not talk to each other on this day. The son went out in the afternoon and later in the evening, the mother went out to buy dinner and subsequently, ran into her son outside the door of the unit. At about 6 pm, the son noticed that his plastic toy horse which he had since young was not in its usual place. The mother then informed him that she had thrown it away as it was already in a bad shape as the plastic had become “brittle and falling apart”. She did so as she was clearing and cleaning up the house for the upcoming Home Improvement Programme by the Housing and Development Board.

14     According to her, the son became really aggressive, started hitting and punching her face non-stop until she became “really giddy”. He then demanded that she should compensate him with $500 for throwing away the toy horse and threatened to smash up her things in the house.

15     She somehow managed to leave the house dazed and fearing for her safety. She feared that he might smash her belongings in the house and as such, she decided to transfer to him the $500 to appease him. As evidence of this, she produced a copy of the transaction history showing that on 1 December 2019, she transferred a sum of $500 out from her account[^9].

16     The mother could not take any more of the son’s physical and emotional abuses and decided to make a police report on 1 December 2019 at the Clementi Neighbourhood Police Centre (Clementi Police)[^10]. In the police report, she related the incident that occurred on 30 November (4th incident) and the 1 December. She was advised not to return home for her own safety and to stay with her brother. She was also advised to go for a medical check-up and did attend at the Ng Teng Fong Hospital but did not obtain a medical report as she was informed by the doctor that the medical report would be submitted to the Clementi Police.

17     In addition, she also exhibited a record of a WhatsApp message made by her to her son at about 6.23 p.m. on 1 Dec 2019 to inform him that she had already transferred the $500 to his account. In response to that, the son responded to her in the WhatsApp the following which she felt was insulting:

> “You can go fuck off and rot in hell. You are the dirtiest most worthless piece of shit in this household. You should just throw yourself away BEFORE YOU THROW AWAY ANYTHING THAT BELONGS TO ME, STUPID RETARDED MOTHERFUCKER.” [^11]

18     The mother also produced photographs taken of the state of her house which contained her son’s personal belongings[^12]. He had warned her not to touch any of his belongings and for fear of his anger and bad temper, he had left his belongings as they were.

19     In her evidence, she stated that she was very disappointed with the son whom did not treat her like a mother but like an animal. She felt very “down hearted” and very depressed for having such a son to whom she had given everything that he wanted, though she had treated him with respect and love[^13].

20     In cross examination, the son took issue with several parts of the mother’s evidence.

21     With regards to the 1st and 2nd incidents, despite the mother’s explanation, he questioned the mother as to why she had not made police reports or obtained medical attention after the incidents. In response to these questions, she reiterated that she did not make a police report as she wanted to give him a chance as he might be having pressure at work and that a police report might affect his career[^14]. She was also hopeful that the son would change for the better but when he continued to act in the same way in the 3rd, 4th and finally the 5th incident, she decided to make a police report. As for the 1st incident, she did not seek medical attention as the injury sustained only caused her to have a “blue black” bruise.

22     The son challenged the reliability of the photographs taken of her injuries in that there were material inconsistency in the location where the photographs were taken. He referred her to his copies of photographs of the location where the photographs were alleged to have been taken. The son alleged that the photographs were not taken in the female toilet as claimed by the mother on the basis that the floor tiles in the mother’s photograph were different from those in his photographs (in R7). Further, he claimed that the last 2 photographs in the mother’s bundle (in C3) were in fact taken at the flat as the flooring and the bench (seen in C3) resembled those seen in the photographs taken by him (in R8).

23     The mother’s response in relation to the floor tiles was that her photographs (in C3) were taken in the ladies’ toilet whilst that by her son were taken at the men’s toilet. Their photographs were thus taken from different locations. As regards the 2 photographs alleged to be taken at the flat, whilst the son had pointed this to me, the son did not, however, put any question to her on this aspect of his evidence.

24     As regards the 3rd incident involving the pouring of the cooking oil, he claimed that the mother’s evidence was “patently incoherent” as between the 3rd and 4th incident, a period of eight months, there was no incident despite there being three incidents in the three months period from January to March 2019[^15].

25     On the 4th incident, he noted that the mother’s evidence was that she had asked him to switch off the television as the mother thought he had dozed off, after which he took a bottle of water and poured the water on her. As the mother had acknowledged that he is hot-tempered and had problem with his anger, he questioned her as to why she still provoked him. He claimed that what took place was that the mother had actually walked towards where he was sleeping and took a look at his eyes to see if it was closed or opened. Further, he questioned her why she had not gone to see a doctor as she would have suffered burns from his acts of pouring the water on her.

26     In response, the mother denied provoking him or walking over to check if his eyes were closed or opened but that she was merely asking him to switch off the television as she thought he had dozed off. She also confirmed that thereafter the son got so angry that he took a bottle of water and poured over her head causing her to be drenched. As for the son’s mentioning of burns, she replied that the bottle contained cold water and that she never said it contained hot water.

27     As regards the 5th incident, the son questioned the mother on whether she thought it was wrong to throw away someone else’s property as the mother had thrown away one of his favourite childhood toy, that is, the plastic horse. In reply, she asked the son whether it was also wrong for him to throw away her pyjamas in the dustbin, an incident which occurred many months before she threw away the plastic horse. The son then used the two incidents to suggest that the motive for the mother taking action against him after the 5th incident was to get back at him for throwing away her pyjamas few months back, what he described as a “tit for tat”.

28     The mother explained that the plastic horse was in terrible condition, was all smashed up, useless, had no value and reiterated again that she was also trying to clear the house for the Home Improvement programme.

29     As regards the son’s other belongings, she informed that she would not touch them and would want the son to remove them on his own. When asked by the son on the events that took place that day, she reiterated that after he found out that she had thrown away the plastic horse, he got angry and had hit and punched her after which she compensated him with $500. She reiterated that she did so to appease him as she was afraid that he would smash all her belongings if she did not do so. The mother also said that she could no longer take the treatment by her son as he was disrespectful and insulting when he made the remarks in the WhatsApp message which to her, were “horrible”.

30     With regards to the police report of 1 December 2019, the son also took issue on the mother’s statement in the police report wherein she stated that since the beginning of the year, he had been hitting her and that she used to make a lot of report against the son the “last time”[^16]. He alleged her of lying as there had not been any police report of the earlier incidents including the 1st and 2nd incidents. The mother confirmed that she did not make any previous report on the earlier incidents involving the son but previously, there had been reports of violence against the son by her late husband.

## The son’s evidence

31     Much of what the son wanted to tell the court had been said in the examination of the mother. Notwithstanding that, he repeated the same in his evidence- in- chief, including reiterating why the mother had not gotten medical attention or medical reports and had not made police reports of the incidents other than the one made after the 5th incident.

32     In addition, in his evidence, the son added that his mother’s reason for applying for a PPO and a DEO was not motivated by her genuine need for protection from him but a “means to settle a score”.

33     He narrated that in November 2018, he had gone on a holiday trip to Finland and Denmark with the mother for about three weeks, and in January 2019, to Maldives for a week. If the mother had been badly treated, she would not have agreed to follow him on these trips. They also went to Vietnam in March.

34     As regards the allegations set out by the mother in the 5 incidents narrated by her;

> a)     He denied kicking her in the 1st incident and reiterated the discrepancies in the photographs taken by the mother. He also questioned if the injuries arose from a fall.

> b)     He denied to hitting her with a hanger on her face in the alleged 2nd incident.

> c)     He denied pouring the bottle of cooking oil on her in the alleged 3rd incident.

> d)     He denied the 4th incident, that there was an argument arising from the mother asking him to switch off the television but the pouring of the water over her was “just nothing more than a figment of her imagination”.

> e)     He denied the 5th incident where he was alleged to have hit and punched the mother.

35     In response to the son’s evidence in relation to the holiday trips, the mother stated [^17] that she had followed him on these trips as she thought that might change him and though she rejected his offer initially, she decided to come along as it would help in her bonding with him [^18] . However, during the trip, she informed that he also “tortured” her. She mentioned that on a day which was freezing cold in Finland, he threatened that he would not bring her home and that she could “stay under the snow for the whole night”. When she started to cry, he told her that she could cry and stay where she was.

36     In the cross-examination of the son, the mother put forth to him that all the incidents as alleged by her did happen. She added that in the 3rd incident, he even poured the oil on the floor to make it slippery so that she would fall. As regards the 4th incident, he had also poured a second round of water taken from the toilet. After the 5th incident, she confirmed that she did go to Ng Teng Fong Hospital for medical treatment but did not obtain a medical report as she was told by the hospital that they would send the same to the police.

37     In summing up her case, she reiterated that she needed a PPO and DEO for her own protection and would allow her son two to three weeks to move his belongings if a DEO was granted.

38     In his submission, the son stated that the whole of the mother’s case was “basically built on a figment of her imagination” and that due to the long standing issues between them in their relationship, the mother (whom he also referred to as an unhappy and a “very cunning individual”) was using the latest episode to advance her cause, namely to get back at him[^19].

## The Law

39     Section 65(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353) (the Act) states as follow:

> “The Court may, upon satisfaction on a balance of probabilities that family violence has been committed or likely to be committed against a family member and that it is necessary for the protection of the family member, make a protection order restraining the person against whom the order is made from using family violence against the family member”.

40     “Family violence” is defined in section 64 of the Act as follows:

> “Family violence means the commission of any of the following acts:

>> (a)    wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;

>> (b)    causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;

>> (c)    wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his will; or

>> (d)    causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that is likely to cause anguish to a family member,

> but does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age.”

41     “Hurt” is defined in the section 64 to mean bodily pain, disease or infirmity.

## Findings

42     The mother is clearly a “family member” capable of being protected under law. As regards “hurt”, the alleged acts of kicking in the 1st incident, the use of a clothes hanger to hit the mother’s face in the 2nd incident and the punching in the 5th incident would come within the definition of “hurt” as there would be bodily pain.

43     As regards the 3rd and 4th incident, the throwing of cooking oil and cold water would startle a person but would not cause bodily pain. However continual action of similar nature may qualify as “family violence” under limb (d) of the definition of “family violence” which reads as follow:

> “(d)  Causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that is likely to cause anguish to a family member.”

44     There is no definition of “harassment” in the Act but guidance can be obtained from _Chee Siok Chin and others v Minister for Home Affairs and another (_2005) SGHC 216 wherein VK Rajah J (as he then was) stated (albeit in the context of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance Act):

> “The fact that Parliament did not define the word “harassment” in ss 13A and 13B of the MOA is a strong indication that this word, like the words “insult” and “abusive”, is intended to be accorded a common-sense meaning. Harassment describes determined conduct which is directed at persons and is calculated to produce discomfort and /or unease and/or distress: see Malcomson Nicholas Hugh Bertran v Mehta Naresh Kumar (2001) 3 SLR (R) 379.”

45     With regards to the pictures of the mother’s injuries following the alleged 1st incident, I did not accept the son’s assertion that the mother’s photographs were not in fact taken from the female toilet of Clementi Mall just because the flooring in those photographs were different from the flooring of the male toilet shown in the photographs which the son had taken. The son could have gone to the Mall and with some assistance, obtain photographs of the flooring of the female toilet to disprove the mother’s evidence. As for the last 2 photographs (in C3), it was never put to the mother that these were in fact taken at home. However, even if I accept his assertion that the 2 photographs were taken at home, that did not lead me to a conclusion that the mother lied that she had suffered bruises arising from the assault. As such, I did not think her credibility has been affected due to this aspect of the evidence.

46     The mother had produced photographs to show the injuries she claimed to have been sustained. Looking at these alone and in the absence of any medical evidence from a medical practitioner, the nature or extent of the injuries could not be fully determined. However, at least one of the photographs did support the mother’s claim that she suffered “blue black” bruising from the kicks inflicted by the son[^20].

47     The son had also made an issue on the mother’s failures to make police reports or obtain medical reports on the 1stto the 4th incidents. I did not think that her failure to make the police reports should be taken against her. Her reasons for not doing so , that she wanted to give the son a chance to change and that she did not want to mar his career, were in my view, sensible and reasonable.

48     Her failures to get medical attention after the 1st to 4th incidents were also not to be faulted as, from the evidence, there were either no injuries with regards to the 3rd and 4th incidents whilst the 1st and 2nd did not give rise to any serious injuries . She finally made the police report after the 5th incident and did go to a hospital for her injuries but did not obtain the medical report as she was told that it would be send to the police. I also did not think that the absence of the medical report was fatal to the mother’s case as her description of the injuries she sustained, in particular the “blue back” marks which were likely bruises, were consistent with the description of the assault alleged to have been made. It would have been different if the injuries were consistent with a fall which the son had suggested but did not pursue further.

49     With regards to the 4th incident, the mother’s evidence was that she had called on the son to switch off the television as he thought the son had dozed off. From the evidence, it appeared that the son had in fact dozed off and the mother’s act had woken him up from his sleep and arising from that, he likely got angry. The son did not deny that he had anger management issues and even used that to his advantage when alleging that the mother had provoked him in relation to the 4th incident. Even if she had provoked him, there was no reason for him to retaliate in the manner he did by splashing water on her not once, but twice.

50     On the whole, I found the mother to be a truthful witness. Her testimony were consistent throughout and despite the repeated questionings and suggestions put forth by her son in the cross-examination, she came out unscathed and her responses to his questions were found to be reasonable and believable. For instance, while the son had attempted to discredit her for still wanting to accompany him for overseas trip despite his mistreatments, she reasoned that she did so in order to improve their relationship through bonding with him. Even on these trips, her evidence was that she was also mistreated by constant threats, an assertion that the son did not refute in his evidence.

51     The son’s version of the alleged assaults was a bare denial that the assaults took place, though he did not dispute that there were arguments during the 4th and 5th incidents. I also rejected his evidence and assertions that the allegations made by the mother were a “figment of her imagination” or was motivated by her to get back at him as what he described as a “tit for tat”.

52     Finally, the response made by the son to the mother’s after she transferred $500 to him was telling of how domineering he was towards the mother. Instead of thanking her, he told her off with the four-letter word and wished that the mother “rot in hell”. If that wasn’t enough, he accused her of being the “dirtiest most worthless piece of shit” before finishing off by calling her a “stupid retarded motherfucker”.

## Conclusion

53     Having considered all the evidence, I was satisfied, on a balance of probabilities that acts of family violence had been committed by the son against the mother. As regards the 1st, 2nd and 5th incidents, there was hurt caused by him.

54     Whilst the incidents relating to the 3rd and 4th incidents involving the throwing of cooking oil and water on the mother would not have caused hurt, i.e. bodily pain , I considered whether the five incidents committed within a span of less than a year, taken cumulatively, would also sufficiently qualify as continual harassment which caused the mother to suffer and did suffer mental anguish as she had expressed that she was “down hearted” and depressed with the son’s conduct. There was also the final act of sending the WhatsApp wherein, to add insult to injury, the son had “bombarded” the mother with the most insulting words in his WhatsApp message to her.

55     Looking at the five incidents, I was also of the view that, despite the 7 months gap between April to October 2019 where there was no incident alleged, there was continual harassment as the son’s conduct against the mother must have been calculated to produce discomfort and distress to her. Based on his actions, the mother did suffer mental anguish from her evidence which I accepted.

56     Further, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, I was also satisfied that a DEO was also necessary for the mother’s protection and safety. The son would continue to be a threat to the safety of mother if allowed to remain in the same flat with her, more so when there would be no other person living in the flat to protect her.

57     The mother was kind enough to give the son some time to remove his belongings whilst she continued to reside with her brother pending that. In view of that, I made an additional order for the DEO to take effect 2 weeks from the date of the order to enable the son to do so.
