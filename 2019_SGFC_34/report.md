Care and Control and Access to child

21 March 2019

### District Judge Nicole Loh:

1       This case related to cross applications for custody, care and control and access issues of a 2½ year old boy filed by both of his parents. In addition, the Father sought an order for the child to be enrolled in a particular childcare centre.

## Orders Made

2       Parties agreed to an order for joint custody and this was granted by consent.

3       After hearing parties, I made the following orders:

(a)     Mother shall have care and control of the child;

(b)     Father shall have access as follows:

(i)       Fridays 6pm to Sundays 8pm;

(ii)       One weekday dinner access from 6pm to 8pm on a fixed day to be agreed between parties;

(iii)       For alternate public holidays, with effect from New Year’s Day 2019, from 6pm of the eve of the public holiday to 6pm on the public holiday; and

(c)     Mother is to send the child to the Father at the start of access and the Father is to return the child at the end of the access;

(d)     No order on the enrolment of the Child into the specific childcare centre and the related access arrangement;

(e)     Father’s counsel to release the Child’s passport to the Mother forthwith;

(f)     Either party shall be entitled to travel with the Child provided the party provides at least 14 days’ advance notice of the travel itinerary, copies of the flight details, accommodation and contact details to the other parent;

(g)     No orders as to cost; and

(h)     Liberty to apply.

## Appeal

4       The Father has appealed against the entire order whilst the Mother has appealed against the weekend and weekday access order.

## Undisputed background facts

5       The parties were married on xx xxx 2014 and their child was born on xx xxx 2016.

6       After the marriage, parties lived in the Father’s parents’ apartment with them as parties’ matrimonial flat was not ready then.

7       The Father is 39 years old and is a full time employee. The Mother is 27 years old and used to be a Kindergarten teacher for about 5 ½ years but stopped work after their Child was born to take care of him.

8       On 20 July 2018, after a quarrel, the Mother left home. Despite a meeting the following day to try to resolve things, parties lived apart since then.

9       The Mother tried to take the Child with her but was prevented from doing so by the Father. In particular, on 23 July 2018, when the Mother visited the matrimonial home to see the Child, there was an incident between the Mother and the paternal grandmother which sparked off a Personal Protection Order application. Since 23 July 2018, the Father refused to allow the Mother to see the Child.

10     She then filed an application in person on 27 July 2018 for a care and control order of the Child.

11     At a case conference on 3 August 2018, the following interim orders were made:

a.     Mother shall care for the child from Mondays to Fridays between 9am to 6pm except when a public holiday falls on the weekday. This shall take effect from 6 August 2018.

b.     Mother shall pick up and drop off the child at the guardhouse of the Father’s residence.

c.     The Father shall care for the child otherwise.

d.     The above orders are not intended to prejudice parties in their positions at mediation/hearing.

e.     By consent, Mother is to hand over the Child’s passport to the Father’s counsel for safekeeping. The Child’s passport shall not be released to either party unless by court order or by mutual agreement.

f.     Neither party shall bring the child out of jurisdiction without consent of the other party or a court order

g.     Liberty to apply.

12     At a subsequent mediation on 31 August 2018, parties further agreed that the Mother will have overnight access on Monday nights.

13     The Father filed a cross application on 13 November 2018.

14     The interim arrangements set out in the Interim Order dated 3 August 2018 and agreement reached on 31 August 2018 continued until the case was heard on 20 December 2018.

## Care and control of the Child

##### Father’s case

15     The Father’s case for care and control was based on the following:

a.     He is the main caregiver of the Child;

b.     The Child will continue to live in his paternal grandparents’ home, which is a home that he has lived in since birth. In comparison, the Mother’s residence is fluctuating and is unknown;

c.     He has strong family support from his parents who have been actively caring for the Child since birth compared to the Mother who provided little detail of her family support;

d.     The Mother is emotionally unstable and has threatened suicide, thereby will be a source of danger for the Child;

e.     The Mother is unable to care for the Child by herself and was always assisted by the paternal grandparents. She often left Child in the care of the paternal grandparents due to her studies and other reasons;

f.     The Mother’s future plans are uncertain as she may be seeking employment; and

g.     It maintains status quo for the Child.

16     He therefore prayed for care and control and is agreeable for the Mother to have access as per the hours she has under the interim Order.

##### Mother’s case

17     The Mother’s case for care and control is based on the following:

a.     She has been the primary caregiver of the Child since his birth;

b.     She is better equipped with skills to care for a young child’s development being a trained young child educator with relevant work experience;

c.     She is available full time to care for the Child compared to the Father who works full time and has other fixed activities;

d.     She will be moving in to live with her mother and can rely on her mother and aunt for any family support, if necessary.

#### Who was the main caregiver?

18     There was a dispute over who was main caregiver of the Child prior to the Mother’s departure on 20 July 2018. Although the Father took pains to describe his involvement with the Child and sought to discredit the Mother’s caregiving extent, it is an undisputed fact that he is a full time employee. He also concedes every Monday night, he is involved in Meet the People sessions and therefore would not be home until such sessions end. He also concedes that he arranges Tuesday game sessions for his old friends, though it depends on the availability of his friends. I accept that when he is with the Child, he is a hands-on parent. However, it cannot be disputed that majority of the Child’s weekdays are not spent with him but with the Mother.

19     The Mother disputed the Father’s claim that she could not cope with the Child on her own and his parents were the main caregivers as she tended to leave the Child with them (to go out or to go for her part-time studies). Other than some photographs of the paternal grandparents taken with the Child, there was no other evidence to support the Father’s claim. I accept that the Mother would have required childcare support from the Father and/or his parents when she went for her night classes or if she went out. I find this reasonable and there is no evidence that she went out excessively to the neglect of the Child. The evidence provided by the Father showed him being supportive of her outing with her ex-boss, which does not corroborate his current grievance about her going out too often.

20     Therefore, despite the Father’s assertions, I find that the Mother was the primary caregiver of the Child. In fact, even post separation (save for the period between 20 July 2018 to 3 August 2018), she continued to be the primary caregiver of the Child based on the interim arrangement. The status quo which the Father sought to rely on post separation meant he took care of the Child at night on Tuesdays to Fridays, during which majority of the time, the Child would be sleeping. It was only during the weekends that he had to take care of the Child wholly.

#### Which is an appropriate residence for the Child?

21     I accept that the Father’s residence is familiar to the Child since the Child lived there since birth. However, this Child is young and adaptable. Given that parties are living separately, the Child will have to get used to having different homes with each parent. The Mother has informed the Court in her second affidavit of her plans to move to her parents’ home, which is a Housing & Development Board (“HDB”) flat. The Father did not ask for leave to reply to provide evidence on the unsuitability of the maternal grandparents’ home but relied on a submission that the Court was not apprised of details relating to the home. He made a similar submission that the Mother had not given details of her caregiving duties. I was not of the view there was a lack of sufficient details in the Mother’s case. Whilst parties should provide sufficient evidence and describe their proposed care arrangements of the Child, it is not a requirement that they should file affidavits providing minute details of what they did with the Child daily. The lack of address being stated in the affidavit is not fatal. The Father knows where the Mother’s parents live. The Court has been informed it is a 5-room HDB flat with 2 spare bedrooms for the Mother and Child to occupy.

22     Therefore, on this factor, there was little advantage to either the Father or Mother’s case. The Child can thrive whether he lived in the Father’s residence or in the Mother’s residence.

#### Is the Mother emotionally unstable and suicidal?

23     The Father’s submission emphasized this allegation on the basis of alleged incidents where the Mother threatened to jump out of the window as well as her erratic emotional outbursts. He exhibited a recording of an argument between them where there was reference made to the earlier threat by her to jump out of the window.

24     I was perturbed by the recording that was exhibited by the Father. The audio recording was obviously secretly done without her knowledge during one of the quarrels. The recording produced did not show how the quarrel started or what it revolved around. Quite clearly, the Mother had already been worked up to an emotional state at the start of the recording that was produced. It was also disturbing to me that it seemed the Mother had been baited by the Father during this quarrel as he repeatedly reminded her of her previous suicide threat and when she finally asked if he wanted her to jump now, he replied positively.

25     It is quite commonplace that parties involved in matrimonial disputes would not exhibit their best behaviour or even their normal behaviour. They are highly stressed and emotional and may even react illogically as emotions are high. The Mother disputed that she has erratic mood swings that have compromised the Child’s safety and wellbeing although she admits, even in her first affidavit, that her marriage has been a rollercoaster and they have had frequent quarrels. Other than this one recording which shows the Mother did threaten to jump down once(it also revealed she was highly distressed at that time as the Child had been taken away from her), there is no other evidence to support the Father’s allegations that the Mother is so emotionally unstable and suicidal.

26     If the Mother was so emotionally unstable and suicidal as claimed, then the Father’s conduct in goading her to commit suicide would be quite appalling. Contrary to the Father’s alleged fear for the safety of the Child, the Child remained to be directly cared for by the Mother even after separation. The Father himself comes to Court with the position that the Court should order the Mother to care for the Child every weekday. I therefore disbelieve the Father’s claim of the Mother’s mental state affecting her ability to care for the Child.

#### What is the best interest of the Child?

27     Given that I have found that the Mother was the primary caregiver of the Child and that she has specific training and experience in caring and educating young children, it would be in the best interest of the Child to return to the care of the Mother. Despite the Father’s case of asking that status quo for the Child to remain, the real status quo was that the Mother had been the main caregiver of the Child until she was separated from the Child from 20 July 2018. Thankfully, the Child continued to benefit from the Mother’s almost daily care from the interim orders put in place rather quickly. I therefore restored the true status quo, i.e. the Mother having care and control.

28     The Father’s application for care and control with access orders as per the interim arrangement was not in the Child’s best interest. This required the daily commuting of the Child between the 2 parents’ residence both in the mornings and evenings. This may have been workable as an interim solution but is not a suitable long-term arrangement.

29     Whilst the Father argued he had better childcare support, this was not a point that the application turned on as the Mother herself was available to look after the Child currently. I appreciated the fact that the Mother may eventually return to the workforce and she shared her plans of putting the Child into the same childcare centre that she would be employed at. Even if this was the case in the future, in view of the Child’s young age as well as the fact the Mother was his primary caregiver from birth, it would still be in his best interest to be in her care as compared to the Father.

30     I therefore ordered the Mother to have care and control of the Child and directed for the release of the Child’s passport to her as is the usual arrangement.

## Access

31     As pointed out in paragraph 18 above, I appreciated the fact that the Father is a hands-on father when he is with the Child. As the Child is still young and not burdened by formal school demands, I sought to provide as much access time to the Father as possible to maintain their bond.

32     The Mother offered one weekday dinner access from 6-8pm and weekly weekend access from Fridays at 6pm to Saturdays at 8pm. She also offered alternate public holiday access. I granted the alternate public holiday and weekday access as proposed by her. For the weekend access, I extended it to end on Sundays at 8pm. In making this order, I took into account that the Mother is currently unemployed and can plan her time with the Child during weekdays flexibly whereas the Father is limited by his employment hours.

33     The Mother objected to the Father having Sunday access as she claimed the Father had not been bringing the Child to church every Sunday. She exhibited an attendance sheet for xxx Playgroup between August 2018 to November 2018. I assume this is the Child’s Sunday School. The Father did not file a reply to this allegation therefore I do not know if there was a reason for the absences. However, in his first affidavit, he did state that he takes the Child to church every Sunday. I will accept that he does have the intention to take the Child to church although there may have been occasions this was not done. I did not adjust the timing of the access for the Mother to ensure the Child went to church every Sunday.

34     I will add that the orders for weekend access as well as for her to send the Child for access were largely affected by the current situation where the Mother is unemployed and the Father is employed. I indicated to the Mother that when the circumstances change, she can seek a variation of the access orders.

35     I ordered the usual notice that should be given to the other parent if one party wishes to bring the child out of jurisdiction.

## Child’s enrolment into a specific Childcare

36     The Father sought the enrolment of the Child into a childcare centre that both parties had agreed upon prior to their separation. Whilst I accept that both parties had agreed to this previously, this was on the basis of the family unit remaining intact and living at Scotts Apartment. Given that there is a substantial change in the circumstances, I did not see a need for the Child to be enrolled in this specific Childcare. It further did not seem to be in the Child’s best interest to be enrolled in a Childcare centre that is far from the Mother’s residence since she will have care and control of the Child. The issue of the Child’s enrolment into a childcare centre can be further explored between parties but there is no urgency for orders to be made regarding enrolment of the Child. He is after all, only 2 ½ years old and there is no specific registration cut-off period for childcare. I therefore made no order on this prayer.
