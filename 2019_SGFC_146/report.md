Family law – Custody, Care and Control – Division of Matrimonial Assets – Maintenance

27 December 2019 - Judgment reserved.

### District Judge Chia Wee Kiat:

## Introduction

1       The Plaintiff shall be referred to as the “Wife” and the Defendant shall be referred to as the “Husband”. The parties were married on 1 March 2003[^1] and an Interim Judgment of Divorce (“IJ”) was granted on an uncontested basis on 26 September 2018 by reason of the Husband’s adultery. Up to the date of the IJ, the parties had been married for 15 ½ years. They have two children, aged 7 and 10 this year.

2       The Wife is 45 years old this year and a banker.[^2] The Husband is 43 years old this year and a senior business manager in a bank.[^3] They currently reside with the children at the matrimonial home at Stratton Walk[^4] where they have lived since 2013.[^5]

3       The ancillary matters first came up for hearing before me on 6 September 2019. The matters that require determination are as follows:[^6]

> (a)     custody, care and control of the children;

> (b)     access to the children;

> (c)     division of matrimonial assets; and

> (d)     maintenance for the children.

4       The Wife is not claiming maintenance for herself.[^7]

5       At the hearing on 6 September 2019, I highlighted to counsel that it would be helpful to have a Joint Summary to identify the assets and issues in dispute. Parties have since filed a Joint Summary which has provided clarity and helped narrow the issues significantly, and I thank both counsel for their efforts and assistance. Parties have also filed Supplemental Submissions to update their positions.

6       At the further hearing on 25 October 2019, I reserved my decision to give full consideration to the parties’ submissions. I also directed parties to provide the court with an updated computation on their proposed division of the matrimonial assets and they have since done so. Parties have indicated that they have no objection for the decision of the court to be rendered in writing.

7       With these contextual remarks, I now set out my determination and orders with respect to each of the ancillary matters.

## Custody, care and control and access

8       Parties agree to have joint custody of the children. Both are seeking sole care and control.[^8]

9       If the Wife has sole care and control, her proposal on the Husband’s access is as follows:[^9]

> (a)     every alternate weekend from Friday 6 pm to Saturday 7 pm;

> (b)     other weekends from Saturday 6 pm to Sunday 7 pm;

> (c)     the Husband is at liberty to go over to the Wife’s home during the evenings on weekdays to spend time with the children and/or to have dinner with the children and the Wife;

> (d)     every alternate public holiday and on the Husband’s birthday;

> (e)     half of the school holidays;

> (f)     for Chinese New Year (“CNY”) – CNY eve, first day and second day (i.e. all 3 days collectively) every alternate year, such that the children can spend all 3 days collectively with the Wife in the other years, as the Wife intends to bring the children with her to her hometown in Segamat, Malaysia, for the said period of at least 3 days in the years when the children will not be with the Husband.

10     If the Husband has sole care and control, his proposal on the Wife’s access is as follows:[^10]

> (a)      Weekly Access

>> (i)       The Wife shall have overnight access from Friday 5 pm to Sunday 1 pm;

>> (ii)       The Wife shall pick the children up from the Husband’s parents’ place of residence by 6 pm on Friday and send them back to the same by 1 pm on Sunday;

>> (iii)       Each parent shall have the liberty to have reasonable telephone and/or video call access with the children when they are in the care/ access of the other parent;

>> (iv)       Each parent shall attend to the children’s education needs when the children are with him/her respectively;

>> (v)       Each parent is responsible for the children’s schoolwork and/or enrichment during their respective time with the children; and

>> (vi)       Each parent shall ensure that the children attend their existing tuition and/or classes during their respective care/ access time.

> (b)      CNY Access

>> (i)       The Husband shall have care of the children from 5 pm on CNY eve to 2 pm on the first day of CNY, upon which he shall drive them to the Wife’s family home in Segamat, Malaysia;

>> (ii)       The Wife shall have access to the children from their abovementioned time of arrival at her family home in Malaysia on the first day of CNY to 4 pm on the second day of CNY, upon which the children are to return to Singapore; and

>> (iii)       The Wife is to return the children to the Husband’s parents’ place of residence by 8 pm on the second day of CNY if it falls on a day which the Husband has care i.e. between Sunday and Thursday (inclusive).

> (c)      School Holiday Access

>> (i)       The Wife shall have access to the children in the first half of the June school holidays, while the Husband shall have care of the children in the second half of the same. Each parent may travel overseas with the children for a period up to 7 days during their care/ access time in the June school holidays;

>> (ii)       Parties’ care/access time shall alternate between the first and second halves of the year-end school holidays, beginning with the Wife having the children for the first half of the year-end school holidays and the Husband having the children on the second half of the same on even years, and vice versa on odd years. Each parent may travel overseas with the children for a period of up to 14 days during their care/access time in the year-end school holidays;

>> (iii)       Normal access applies on all other Singapore school holidays and public holidays e.g. March and September school holidays, Children’s Day, Youth Day and PSLE Marking Days etc;

>> (iv)       Neither parent shall travel overseas with the children during the March/September school holidays; and

>> (v)       Each parent shall give the other party at least one month’s notice for any overseas travel plans with the children and furnish the other parent with the itinerary and expected contact details of the children.

11     It is trite law that in deciding custody, care and control issues, the court must regard the welfare of the child as the paramount consideration: see s 125 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“WC”). In the present case, the parties have both set out their reasons for sole care and control of the children in their written submissions;[^11] broadly speaking, both have asserted that they have been the primary caregiver of the children[^12] and are the more suitable parent to be granted care and control.[^13] The Husband says that he is more concerned over the substance of the care to the children rather than the form and is willing to term the care and control as shared care and control as long as the terms of access as proposed by him remain.[^14]

12     In custody, care and control cases, the court is faced with the task of choosing the best of two or more imperfect solutions and there are often no right answers: see _CX v CY_ \[2005\] 3 SLR (R) 690 (at \[17\]). In the present case, the access arrangements proposed by both parties show that there is at least some broad agreement in dividing the access time equally for CNY and the June/December (year-end) school holidays. It is also clear that both of them are willing to ensure a continuing relationship between the children and the other party;[^15] for example, the Wife has offered for the Husband to go over to the Wife’s home during the evenings on weekdays to spend time with the children and have dinner with the children and the Wife, and the Husband has proposed to drive the children to the Wife’s family home in Segamat, Malaysia on the second day of CNY. In the early stage of the proceedings, the Wife had also proposed for the children to be picked up from school each day by their paternal grandparents after school and she would pick the two children up from the home of her parents-in-law after she finishes work each day.[^16]

13     Currently, the two children are living in the matrimonial home with the parties. They are sent to school and picked up from school by their paternal grandparents who reside at a nearby property[^17] and the Husband would pick up the children from his parents’ home after work.[^18] The children get to spend the evenings and weekends with their parents when the parties are not working.

14     The most significant difference in the post-divorce arrangements proposed by the parties is in relation to weekly access. The access proposed by the Wife is frequent and liberal (daily evening access and overnight weekend access) whilst the Husband’s proposal is for the Wife to pick the children up from the Husband’s parents’ place of residence by 6 pm on Friday and send them back to the same by 1 pm on Sunday.

15     In _ABW v ABV_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 769</span> (at \[20\]), it was observed that “\[c\]ontinuity of arrangements or stability is an important factor for the emotional well-being of a child”. In my view, this is a particularly relevant consideration in the present case given the relatively young age of the two children.

16     Between the two proposals for weekly access, I find the Wife’s proposal to provide greater continuity to the living arrangements of the children – the children will continue to reside in the home they are familiar with (the Wife has proposed to retain the matrimonial home post-divorce)[^19] and continue to have regular interaction and physical contact with both parents. They will also get to spend time with both parents in the weekend and during weekend access, they will get to spend time with the paternal grandparents.

17     In contrast, the Husband’s proposal will require the children to be uprooted from their home (the Husband has proposed for the matrimonial home to be sold in the open market with the first option to purchase given to the Wife)[^20] and the loss of daily physical contact with the Wife on most weekdays. There is no indication as to what the children’s living arrangement would be when the matrimonial home is sold. The Husband says that his parents are crucial in tending to the children’s needs on weekday afternoons and removing the children from this comfortable arrangement would be most disconcerting for them.[^21]

18     Whilst I have no doubt that it is in the interests of the children to maintain a close bond with the paternal grandparents, this should not be to the exclusion of the personal love and care of the parents. Young children would benefit from regular interaction and physical contact with both parents (see _BNS v BNT_ \[2014\] SGHC (at \[44\])); grandparents, however much they love the grandchildren, cannot be substitutes for the personal love and care of a parent (see _TQ v TR_ \[2009\] 2 SLR(R) (at \[18\])). Therefore, any access arrangements post-divorce must support the primary role and responsibility of the natural parents in the children’s upbringing and development.

19     Parental responsibility does not end even when a marriage does (see _AZB v AZC_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHCF 1</span> (at \[2\])). It is the primary responsibility of the parties, as parents, to work out the terms of access on their own post-divorce. No one is in a better position to help the children lead normal and happy lives in the post-divorce family than the parents themselves. These are personal and intimate matters and the court is, after all, a stranger to the family. As noted by Debbie Ong J in _UXH v UXI_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHCF 24</span> (at \[28\]):

> Barring exceptional circumstances where a parent is unfit, parents know their child best and are the most suitable persons to make decisions and bear responsibility for their child. Parenting decisions, even those made after a divorce, should be made by the parents themselves. When parents are unable to reach an agreed arrangement despite their best efforts and they seek the court’s intervention as the last resort, the court will consider all the circumstances to determine what is in the child’s welfare, but this does not change the reality that the court is not the child’s parent.

20     Furthermore, decisions made by the parties themselves allow for greater flexibility that is necessary to cater to changes to the schedules of the parties, the changing needs of the children and the vicissitudes of life that can never be fully anticipated in a court order. In the present case, both parties are capable individuals so there is no reason to believe they are incapable of working out terms of access on their own.

21     I pause here to note that the paternal grandparents have been intimately involved in the care of the children since they were born, a fact not disputed by the Wife.[^22] Unfortunately, the relationship between the Wife and the mother-in-law appears to have deteriorated since she filed the divorce proceedings.[^23] This does not augur well for the children who may find themselves caught in between the conflicts. However, such relational problems are not insurmountable. With a big heart and some measure of compassion, it is possible for the adults to put aside their differences and foster a harmonious relationship. Such effort will go a long way towards providing the children with a sense of comfort, stability and peace of mind especially during the most difficult period of transition.

22     For the above reasons, my orders on access are intended first and foremost to encourage the parties to work out the access arrangements themselves. This will require both parents to co-operate but I have no reason to doubt that they would not place the needs of the children before their own. Hence, it is only in the event that they are unable to agree will the specific access orders prescribed by the court prevail. Whilst it would have been preferable for the parties to decide for themselves, these specific access orders would nonetheless provide a pragmatic way for the parties to move forward should they face an impasse.

## Orders – Custody, care and control and access

23     For the above reasons, my orders are as follows:

> (a)     The Wife and the Husband be granted joint custody of the children with care and control to the Wife and liberal access to the Husband.

> (b)     The parties are to work out the terms of access on their own, always bearing in mind the children’s needs and school schedules. Parties should be flexible and accommodating to each other’s schedules.

> (c)     In the event that the parties are unable to reach an agreed arrangement despite their best efforts, the following access arrangements shall prevail:

>> (i)       The Husband shall have access to the children in the evening from 7 pm to 9 pm on Monday to Thursday;

>> (ii)       Every alternate weekend from Friday 6 pm to Saturday 7 pm;

>> (iii)       Other weekends from Saturday 6 pm to Sunday 7 pm;

>> (iv)       Every alternate public holiday and on the Husband’s birthday;

>> (v)       CNY – Collectively 3 days (CNY eve, 1st day and 2nd day) in 2020 and every alternate year thereafter. In the alternate years when the children are not with the Husband, the Wife shall be permitted to bring the children to Segamat, Malaysia to celebrate CNY for the said 3 days;

>> (vi)       Half of the June/December (year-end) school holidays. Each parent may travel overseas with the children for a period of 7 days during their care/access time in the June school holidays and up to 14 days in the December (year-end) school holidays. Each parent shall give the other party at least one month’s notice for any overseas travel plans with the children and furnish the other parent with the itinerary and expected contact details of the children;

>> (vii)       Half of the March/September school holidays. Unless the parties agree otherwise, neither parent shall travel with the children during the March/September school holidays;

>> (viii)       Normal access applies to all other school holidays;

>> (ix)       Each parent shall have the liberty to have liberal telephone and/or video call access with the children when they are in the care/access of the other parent;

>> (x)       Each parent shall attend to the children’s education needs when the children are with him/her respectively;

>> (xi)       Each parent is responsible for the children’s schoolwork and/or enrichment during their respective time with the children; and

>> (xii)       Each parent shall ensure that the children attend their existing tuition and/or classes during their respective care/access time.

28     The Husband believes that the Wife has approximately MYR 300,000 in this account but has no statements to prove so. The Husband submits that an adverse inference should be drawn in his favour.[^30]

29     The Wife’s position is that she gave this account as a gift to her father.[^31] She had disclosed this account in her first Affidavit of Assets and Means (“AOM”) where she explained that this is a bank account in Segamat, her home-town in Malaysia. Her father had some years ago told her about the account and she recall allowing the father access to the account for him to keep and retain the entire balance therein. She does not now have the documents relating to the account and her father also cannot recall the exact amount therein before she made the balance available to her father as a gift to him.[^32]

## Husband’s Assets

30     There are 14 assets under the Husband’s sole name. The parties agree that the following 14 assets are matrimonial assets with a total value of $464,724.98:[^33]

## Issues for determination

34     The Joint Summary and the parties’ computations (as set out in their respective letters dated 1 November 2019[^49]) have narrowed the issues to the following questions:

> (a)     Whether the Husband’s credit card debts amounting to $6,315.38**[^50]** should be treated as liabilities to reduce the net value of the assets in the Husband’s sole name;

> (b)     What is the ratio of the indirect contributions that should be ascribed to the parties;

> (c)     Whether a 60% weightage should be accorded in favour of the parties’ direct contributions; and

> (d)     Whether an adverse inference may be drawn against the Wife.

## Analysis and determination

#### Whether Husband’s credit card debts should be treated as liabilities to reduce the net value of his sole assets

35     The Husband submits that the expenses of $6,315.38 on his credit cards were used for the family and/or children expenses[^51] and has deducted this amount from the net value of his sole assets which reduces the net value to $458,409.60 ($464,724.98 - $6,315.38). The Wife submits that the Husband’s credit card liabilities should not be utilised to reduce his sole assets.[^52]

36     Although the amount in question is not significant, the issue nevertheless requires a determination as parties have not been able to resolve this. There are different ways to look at this matter but I would prefer the view that the credit card liabilities should not be deducted from the value of the Husband’s sole assets as these are unsecured debts that do not affect the net value of a property (see _Wan Lai Cheng v Quek Seow Kee and another appeal and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGCA 40</span> at \[64\] for an example of an encumbrance that affects the net value of a property).

37     However, this is not to say that the credit card debts incurred by the Husband for the benefit of the family are irrelevant. It is clear that under s 112(2)(b) of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353) (“WC”), “any debt owing or obligation incurred or undertaken by either party for their joint benefit or for the benefit of any child of the marriage” is a relevant consideration in the division of matrimonial assets. It is a factor to be taken into consideration in reaching a just and equitable result.

38     As the credit card debts were expenses incurred for the benefit of the family, it is also possible to consider such expenses as part of the Husband’s indirect contribution under s 112(b) of the WC. It is trite that indirect contribution under s 112(b) includes indirect financial contribution (see _TNL v TNK_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 15</span> at \[43\] & \[46\]).

39     In this regard, I note that the Husband has submitted as follows:[^53]

> In summary, it is submitted that the Husband ought to be given 70% for his indirect contributions owing to his large indirect financial and non-financial contributions …

> Further, as shown above, the Husband’s income is quite substantial. However, due to his greater contribution towards the household and children expenses, the Husband’s current savings are dwarfed by the same of the Wife’s …[^54]

40     It is clear from the above that the Husband has already included his expenses for the family as part of his indirect contribution.

#### Indirect contributions

41     The Wife submits than an indirect contribution of 80% should be ascribed to her[^55] as she had contributed more towards the indirect contributions of the family, both financially and non-financially. [^56] In attempting to conceive, she had to undergo significant physical hardship, including In-Vitro Fertilisation (“IVF”) procedures. This was in addition to having to pay for the procedures and consultations herself.[^57] She has been the primary caregiver for the children and has paid for most of the children’s expenses during the marriage and managed the household, though she acknowledges that this was done in part with the assistance of the Husband’s parents and domestic helpers.[^58] In addition to her role as a supportive mother, the Wife was also a supportive partner to the Husband throughout the course of the marriage.[^59]

42     The Husband says that he has made extraordinary contributions towards the household and children[^60] and ought to be given 70% for his indirect contribution.[^61] He has been the one bearing most of the family’s expenses throughout the marriage,[^62] including paying his parents $1,000 to $1,300 a month for providing the family’s weekday meals and care of the two children on weekdays [^63] and salaries and other related expenses for the period (2012 to 2015) when the parties had a domestic helper. [^64] He claims that as a result, the Wife was able to accumulate a huge amount of savings in her bank accounts and investments of over $2 m today, whilst he has only $130,000 of savings in his bank accounts.[^65] The Husband asserts that despite having a full-time job at a bank, he has not neglected the family and has instead prioritised them[^66] whilst the Wife’s focus lay on building up her own career.[^67] The Husband says that whilst parties had initially started out with roughly equivalent incomes in 2014, their income disparity eventually widened as he had focused on the upbringing of the children at the expense of his career aspirations and took on the greater burden in caring for them[^68] such as coaching them in their schoolwork. [^69]

43     In their respective affidavits filed for this ancillary hearing, the parties have gone into rather great details of their married life in an attempt to amplify their contributions. The Wife, for example, has exhibited over 300 pages of credit card statements dating back to 5 July 2009[^70] whilst the Husband has chronicled minute details of his contributions from 2003[^71] such as fixing the Wife’s shoes and booking taxis for the Wife[^72] and researching on pond measurements for the renovation of the matrimonial home.[^73]

44     The parties have each claimed to have contributed more towards the family and children’s expenses. While it is clear that both have contributed to the expenses, it is far from clear that one has contributed more than the other has. The position contended by both parties is not a conclusion that can be reached by looking at the credit card statements alone or from inferences drawn by comparing the parties’ incomes and savings.

45     The submissions on indirect contributions have, unfortunately, resulted in the parties assigning blame for the breakdown of the marriage. The Wife contends that she had to put up with the Husband’s frequent nights out and episodes of infidelity throughout the marriage and also put up with being bullied, shamed and abused.[^74] On the other hand, the Husband contends that the Wife did not fulfil her role as a wife and had completely neglected his needs.[^75] He says that the Wife often rejects physical intimacy and was uncaring towards him,[^76] even suggesting she had improperly associated with other men at her workplace,[^77] which is disputed by the Wife.

46     In light of the stance taken by the parties, it is worthwhile to revisit the observations of the court in _JBB v JBA_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 153</span> (at \[15\] and \[18\]):

> The notion of “no-fault” divorce was first introduced with the amendment to the Women’s Charter in 1980, and has since been repeatedly affirmed by our courts. … Given this regime, neither party is treated as being the one at fault in the breakdown of the marriage …

> …

> The “no-fault” divorce regime recognises that the breakdown of a marriage is a complicated matter and may be attributed to far more reasons than what can be set out in court documents. It is also undesirable to attribute fault to a party, as it can increase acrimony and resentment in the post-divorce family which requires cooperative parenting for the children of the marriage …

47     It is a trite that while the court is not precluded from considering the conduct of the parties in exercising its power to order the division of matrimonial assets under s 112(2) of the WC, the court only ought to have regard to conduct that is both _extreme_ (i.e, manifestly serious) and _undisputed_ for the purpose of ascribing a “negative contribution”: see _Chan Tin Sun v Fong Quay Sim_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGCA 2</span> (“_Chan Tin Sun_”) (at \[25\]). As stressed by the Court of Appeal, the hearing of the ancillaries is not intended to be another forum for parties to dredge up accusations and allegations relating to each other’s conduct. In the present case, I did not find any of the allegations made by the parties against the conduct of the other party to be relevant or helpful to the determination of the division of matrimonial assets.

48     Apart from seeking blame, both parties have also disputed or sought to downplay the contributions made by the other party. For example, the Husband asserts that the Wife would be late in returning home leaving the Husband to care for the children[^78] while the Wife contends that she has raised the children without much assistance from the Husband due to his travels and frequent nights out.[^79]

49     In _ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGCA 34</span> (“_ANJ v ANK_”), the Court of Appeal observed as follows (at \[24\]).

> Contributions in the form of parenting, homemaking and husbandry, by their very nature, are incapable of being reduced into monetary terms. No mathematical formula or analytical tool is capable of capturing or accommodating the diverse and myriad set of factual scenarios that may present themselves to court as to how the parties may have chosen to divide among themselves duties and responsibilities in the domestic sphere. It is in making this determination that what is known as the broad brush approach would have to come into play. What values to give to the indirect contributions of the parties is necessarily a matter of impression and judgment of the court.

50     Determining the parties’ indirect contributions is an exercise in “broad strokes”: see also _ARY v ARX_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGCA 13</span> at \[55\]. As noted in _UBM v UBN_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHCF 13</span> (at \[59\]):

> No useful purpose is served by parties litigating the matter in a mathematical fashion, filing affidavit after affidavit on every contribution they can come up with. Parties in a functioning marriage do not keep records of their transactions with a view to building a case should divorce occur, so gaps in the evidence, especially in long marriages, can be expected.

51     The following observations in _TIG v TIH_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHCF 12</span> (citing _Parra v Parra_ \[2003\] 1 FCR 97) (at \[23\] & \[25\]) also bear reiterating:

> … the outcome of ancillary relief cases depends upon the exercise of a singularly broad judgment that obviates the need for the investigation of minute detail and equally the need to make findings on minor issues in dispute …

52     In the present case, I have no doubt that many things were done out of love, concern and responsibility by the parties in happier times. The Husband, for example, has acknowledged that “from end-2003 to 2009, we equally shared the household chores since we were both working full-time”[^80] and the Wife has acknowledged that in the course of the marriage, the Husband did drive the Wife and the children to visit the Wife’s family in Malaysia “for which I am grateful for”.[^81] In happier times, the parties contributed in various aspects to the wellbeing of the family, not unlike what one would ordinarily expect in any functioning marriage.

53     At the core, this is a case where both parties are working full-time and had the assistance of the paternal grandparents and domestic helpers.[^82] Consistent with the broad-brush approach, the indirect contributions of the parties are best assessed from this broad perspective from which there can be little dispute. In this regard, the following observation in _ANJ v ANK_ (at \[24\]) bears reiterating:

> In most homes, even in a home where both the spouses are working full time, in the absence of concrete evidence it is more likely than not that ordinarily the wife will be the party who renders greater indirect contributions.

54     In my judgment, it is more likely than not that the Wife has rendered greater indirect contributions. This is particularly so considering the fact that the Wife had to endure IVF procedures in 2008 to conceive the first child.[^83]

55     As noted in _TYS v TYT_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHCF 7</span> (at \[43\]):

> The relevance of IVF treatment to indirect contribution, in recognition of the “high toll” it exacts on the mother, physically, emotionally and psychologically, was recognised by the High Court in _AVM v AWH_ \[2015\] 194 (at \[64\]).

56     The relevance of IVF treatment to indirect contribution was affirmed by the Court of Appeal in _BPC v BPB_ \[2019\] SGCA 03 (at \[83\] & \[83\]) (“_BPC v BPB_”) where, like the present case, the parties had two children and the first child was conceived _via_ IVF procedures. The High Court had taken the IVF treatment into consideration in determining the Wife’s indirect contribution which was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.

57     On balance, I find the scale tilted in favour of the Wife. However, I do not think the ratio of 80:20 proposed by the Wife is an accurate reflection of the parties’ indirect contributions. In my judgment, a ratio of 60:40 would be more appropriate.

#### Weightage

58     The Wife submits that given the size of the matrimonial pool and contributions from the parties, the length of the marriage and the involvement of the Husband’s parents and domestic helpers, the weight to be given to the parties’ direct contributions should be more than their indirect contributions. The Wife submits that an appropriate ratio between direct and indirect contributions ought to be 60% and 40% respectively.[^84]

59     The Husband submits that the parties’ direct and indirect contribution ratios should be weighted equally.[^85] The Husband points out that indirect contributions in general tend to feature more prominently in long marriages[^86] and so it is unclear how the length of the parties’ marriage herein is relevant in according a higher weightage to direct contributions[^87] when they have been married for over 16 years and have two children to the marriage.[^88] The Husband contends that the size of the matrimonial pool in the present case is not significant enough to warrant according an equal weightage to the parties’ respective contributions.[^89] The Husband submits that the assistance of the Husband’s parents on weekday afternoons and the hiring of domestic helpers equally benefit both parties and should not be relied on as a factor to accord a higher weightage to parties’ direct contributions.[^90] The Husband points out further that he had only hired domestic helpers for approximately 4 out of 16 years of the marriage, i.e. from 2012 to 2015.[^91]

60     As explained in _BPC v BPB_ (at \[89\]):

> The _ANJ_ Approach generally proceeds on the basis that the direct contributions and indirect contributions made by both parties carry _equal_ weight, but that the presence of some factors may require the calibrating of the “average ratio” in favour of one party to produce a just and equitable result: _ANJ v ANK_ at \[26\]. The circumstances that could shift the “average ratio” include: (a) the length of the marriage (in that indirect contributions generally tend to feature more prominently in long marriages); (b) the size of the pool of matrimonial assets and its constituents (in that if the pool of assets available for division is extraordinarily large and the whole pool was accrued by one party’s exceptional efforts, direct contributions are likely to command greater weight as against indirect contributions); and (c) the extent and nature of indirect contributions made (at \[27\]).

61     In the present case, the length of the marriage is about 16 years which is considered to be of moderate length (see _UVF v UVG_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHCF 21</span> at \[52\]). Whilst the marriage is not one that is so long as to require greater weightage to be attached to the indirect contributions, neither is it so short as to warrant a lesser weightage to be given. In other words, the length of the marriage is a neutral consideration in the present case and should not be a reason to accord unequal weightage to the direct and indirect contributions.

62     Leaving aside the issue of adverse inference (which will be dealt with in the later part of this judgment), the total value of asset pool in the present case is $3,954,045.90, which is well below the threshold of $5 m for the matter to be transferred to the Family Division of the High Court for hearing and determination pursuant to Para 86(2)(l) of the Family Justice Courts Practice Directions. It is difficult to see how the size of the asset pool can be described as “extraordinarily large”. This is also not a case where “the whole pool was accrued by one party’s exceptional efforts”. Out of the whole pool, the Husband contributed $1,068,019.13 whilst the Wife contributed $2,978,059.71.

63     I come now to the third consideration. As the Husband himself has stressed:[^92]

> From the outset, we emphasise that this is a dual-income household wherein parties are both working full-time and enjoy the assistance of the Husband’s parents in caring for the Children on weekday afternoons.

64     However, the Husband contends that the assistance of the Husband’s parents on weekday afternoons as well as the hiring of domestic helpers benefits both parties equally. As such, there is no reason to adjust the weightage. In this regard, the following observations of the Court of Appeal in _ANJ v ANK_ (at \[27(c)\] are pertinent:

> Not all indirect contributions carry equal weight. For instance, the engagement of a domestic helper naturally reduces the burden of **homemaking and caregiving responsibilities undertaken by the parties**, and to that extent, the weight accorded to the **parties’ collective indirect contributions** in the homemaking and caregiving aspects may have to be correspondingly reduced.

> \[Emphasis added\]

65     It is clear from the above passage that the rationale for according greater weightage to direct contributions rests on the fact that the assistance rendered by domestic helpers (or for that matter, grandparents too) reduces the burden of the homemaking and caregiving responsibilities undertaken by the parties _collectively_. As such, it is irrelevant whether such assistance benefits both parties equally. Since it is not disputed that the parties enjoy the assistance of the Husband’s parents and domestic helpers which has reduced their burden of homemaking and caregiving collectively, I find it appropriate to assign a 60:40 weightage between direct and indirect contributions to produce a just and equitable result.

66     Finally, the Husband refers to _UBM v UBN_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHCF 13</span> (“_UBM v UBN_”) where the court made the following observation (at \[26\]):

> Further, giving unequal weightage to direct and indirect contributions involves a measure of artificiality and may send the message that the court is constrained to adjust the ratio mathematically, when it is not so restricted; its discretion is, on the contrary, to be exercised in broad strokes.

67     In my view, the above observation should not be taken to mean that unequal weightage to direct and indirect contributions can never be appropriate under any circumstances. It is simply a reminder that the court is not constrained to adjust the ratio mathematically as its discretion is to be exercised in broad strokes. Clearly, how the court is to exercise its discretion must depend on the facts of each case. For example, it was observed in _UBM v UBN_ itself (at \[65\]) that a short marriage without children may present an exception to the general approach in that financial contributions could be given greater weight than other factors. Hence, it is important that the above extract be read in the context of the full judgment and the guidance that may be derived from precedent cases: see _ANJ v ANK_; _BPC v BPB; Twiss, Christopher James Hans v Twiss, Yvonne Prendergast_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGCA 52</span>; _ATE v ATD_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGCA 2</span>.

#### Adverse inference

68     The Husband submits that an adverse inference ought to be drawn against the Wife on the following grounds:

> (a)     The Wife had underdeclared her income in her affidavits and refused to provide further information on the same when the Husband sought clarification _via_ his first Requests for Discovery and Interrogatories;[^93]

> (b)     The Wife has persistently refused to divulge the magnitude of her investment earnings;[^94]

> (c)     The Wife has deliberately concealed her Malaysian Segamat Bank Account statements in these proceedings on the premise that she does not have access to them;[^95]

> (d)     The Wife has displayed her propensity to conceal and dissipate her assets in the thick of proceedings. By the time the parties’ first AOMs were filed, the Wife had already unilaterally expended approximately $1.25 m of assets under her sole name ($1 m paid towards the mortgage loan and $250,530.59 in full to purchase new insurance policies for the children in November 2018).[^96]

69     The Husband submits that it would be just and equitable to increase the Husband’s average percentage contributions conservatively by at least 2% more.[^97]

70     It is trite that the structured approach towards the division of matrimonial assets does not preclude the court from drawing an adverse inference where appropriate. In _ANJ v ANK_, the Court of Appeal noted as follows (at \[29\]):

> Finally, for the avoidance of doubt, we should add that nothing we have said thus far detracts from the court’s powers to draw adverse inference against either party whenever he or she is found to have failed to make full and frank disclosure of the matrimonial assets. It is trite that the party whom the court has found to have hidden away certain matrimonial assets would receive a lower proportion of the known assets (if the court has not already added a specific sum into the pool of matrimonial assets available for distribution to account for the undisclosed assets) (Yeo Chong Lin at \[66\]).

71     The requirements for drawing an adverse inference as set out by the Court of Appeal in _Chan Tin Sun_ (at \[62\]) and reiterated in _BPC v BPB_ (at \[60\]) are as follows:

> 60    The court is entitled to draw an adverse inference against a party who fails to comply with his or her duty of full and frank disclosure of the matrimonial assets: see ANJ v ANK at \[29\] and NK v NL <span class="citation">\[2007\] 3 SLR 743</span> (“NK v NL”) at \[57\]. The court may do so, provided that (Chan Tin Sun at \[62\]):

>> (a)    there is a substratum of evidence that establishes a p_rima facie_ case against the person against whom the inference is to be drawn; and

>> (b)    that person must have had some particular access to the information he is said to be hiding.

72     The inference to be drawn against the party who has failed to comply with his or her duty of full and frank disclosure is that the party’s assets exceeded what has been disclosed in the proceedings. The evidence adduced must be sufficient establish a _prima facie_ case against the party (_BPC v BPB_ at \[63\]).

73     In my judgment, the Husband has failed to establish a _prima facie_ case against the Wife. The Husband’s allegations touching on the Wife’s income, investment earnings and the Malaysian Segamat Bank Account are premised on inadequacies that he perceived in the Wife’s replies to his Requests for Discovery and Interrogatories.

74     The Husband has served a set of Requests for Discovery and Interrogatories dated 28 February 2019[^98] seeking a whole series of information and documents that included the Wife’s income, investment earnings and the Malaysian Segamat Bank Account. The Wife replied to the Requests _vide_ her counsel’s letter dated 14 March 2019.[^99] Not satisfied with the replies, the Husband served a second set of Requests for Discovery and Interrogatories dated 28 March 2019.[^100] In the covering letter dated 28 March 2019, the Husband asserted through his counsel that the Wife’s replies to the Request for Interrogatives dated 28 February 2019 were “inadequately answered or completely evaded”.[^101] The Wife replied _vide_ her counsel’s letter dated 4 April 2019 refuting the allegations that she “completely evaded” queries posed by the Husband as “baseless and unhelpful to the matter”.[^102] The Wife provided specific responses to some of the Husband’s requests and explained why she was unable to provide documents such as those pertaining to the incentive scheme.

75     As I have noted in _UQZ v URA_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGFC 2</span> (at \[101\]):

> In complex matrimonial litigation, it is not uncommon for parties to seek discovery of assets which may or may not eventually be found to be matrimonial assets. The mere fact that a discovery order has been made against a party is not a reason by itself to conclude that there was failure on the part of that party to make full and frank disclosure. It is not a ground by itself for drawing an adverse inference: see _Peh Seng Bee John v Xu Li Ming_ \[2014\] SGDC at \[96\].

76     In the present case, an application for discovery and interrogatories was not filed despite the Husband’s complaints that the Wife’s replies to his Requests for Discovery and Interrogatories were inadequate. As it stands, there has been no determination as to whether the Husband was correct to insist on the production of the documents and information in dispute based on established principles of discovery and interrogatories. The Wife, for example, has on her own accord disclosed the existence of the Segamat Bank Account in her first AOM.[^103] From the explanation given in her affidavit, this is an old account where the balance is not substantial and in any event has been gifted to the father some years ago. The question that arises is whether it is relevant and necessary for her to produce the bank statements for this account given the explanation that has already been provided in her affidavit. However, no application for discovery was ever taken out by the Husband and the issue remains undetermined. In the circumstances, I do not think it can be said that there was a failure on the part of the Wife to make full and frank disclosure.

77     The fourth ground raised by the Husband pertains to the Wife’s alleged concealment and dissipation of matrimonial assets by repaying down the mortgage loan after IJ.[^104] However, it is not disputed that the monies are still present in the asset pool and would still be found in the Wife’s sole assets if they are not considered as contributions to the matrimonial home.

78     As such, I find no reason to draw an adverse inference against the Wife on any of the grounds raised above.

79     Finally, the Husband points to the payment of $250,530.59 towards the insurance policies for the children as another instance of the Wife’s propensity to conceal and dissipate assets. The Wife says that the payment of the children’s insurance premiums is for the benefit of the children and she has not sought any contribution from the Husband.[^105]

80     In _TNL v TNK_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 15</span> (“_TNL v TNK_”), the Court of Appeal observed (at \[23\]):

> Second, and with respect to items (c) to (g), the issue is how the court should deal with substantial sums expended by one spouse during the period: (a) in which divorce proceedings are imminent; or (b) after interim judgment but before the ancillaries are concluded. We are of the view that **if, during these periods, and whether by way of gift or otherwise, one spouse expends a substantial sum, this sum must be returned to the asset pool if the other spouse is considered to have at least a putative interest in it and has not agreed, either expressly or impliedly**, to the expenditure either before it was incurred or at any subsequent time. Furthermore, **this remains the case regardless of whether: (a) the expenditure was a deliberate attempt to dissipate matrimonial assets**; **or (b) the expenditure was for the benefit of the children or other relatives.** The spouse who makes such a payment must be prepared to bear it personally and in full. In the absence of consent, he or she cannot expect the other spouse to share in it.

> \[Emphasis in bold added\]

81     In the present case, it is not disputed that the Wife had purchased two AIA Platinum Generations polices for the children which also provide for savings plan that can be used for their education in future at a cost of US$184,213.67 (S$250,530.59).[^106] Although the insurance premiums could be paid annually, the Wife decided on 23 November 2018 to pay the full amounts for the entire duration of the plan.[^107] However, AIA subsequently informed her that they could not allow advance payments for subsequent instalments and refunded the payment for the older child’s policy into her bank account.[^108] In the circumstances, only the payment amounting to US$101,381.67 (S$138,365.70) for the purchase of the younger child’s policy was successful.

82     As the sum of $138,365.70 was expended after IJ but before the ancillaries are concluded, the amount should be notionally added back to the asset pool even if the expenditure was for the benefit of the younger child. This is clear from the holding in _TNL v TNK_ (at \[23\]). As such, the amount of $138,365.70 shall be notionally added back to the asset pool and allocated as the Wife’s direct contribution (see _TBZ v TCA_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHCF 18</span> at \[56\]).

**Proportions of Division**

83     Both parties in this case have adopted the structured approach laid out by the Court of Appeal in _ANJ v ANK_ (at \[22\]) comprising the following steps:

> Using the structured approach, the court could first ascribe a ratio that represents each party’s direct contributions relative to that of the other party, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party has made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets. Next, to give credit to both parties’ indirect contribution throughout the marriage, instead of giving the party who has contributed more significantly than the other an “uplift” to his or her direct contribution percentage, the court should proceed to ascribe a second ratio to represent each party’s indirect contribution to the well-being of the family relative to that of the other. Using each party’s respective direct and indirect percentage contributions, the court then derives each party’s average percentage contribution to the family which would form the basis to divide the matrimonial assets. Further adjustments (to take into account, inter alia, the other factors enumerated in s 112(2) of the WC) may need to be made to the parties’ average percentage contributions ….

84     I agree that the structured approach is the appropriate approach to be applied in the present case. A summary of my findings in respect of the various components is as follows:

85     I have considered the other factors enumerated in s 112(2) of the WC but see no reason to make any adjustment to the parties’ average percentage contributions.

## Orders – Division of Matrimonial Assets

86     For the above reasons, I make the following orders:

> (a)     The pool of matrimonial assets comprises the assets set out at paragraph 84(a) and is assessed at a net value of $4,092,411.60.

> (b)     The matrimonial assets shall be divided in the proportion of 31.3% to the Husband and 68.7% to the Wife.

> (c)     The parties are at liberty to decide on how the order on the division of matrimonial assets is to be effected. If the parties are unable to come to an agreement, they are at liberty to apply for further orders to implement the order as to the division of matrimonial assets.

87     The parties should write to inform the court if they perceive any errors in computations or otherwise on the various figures stated, within one week from the date of this judgment.

## Maintenance for the children

88     The children’s total monthly expenses as quantified by the Wife is $4,666.37.[^113] The Wife is seeking maintenance of $3,000 per month for both children.[^114]

89     The Husband’s quantification of the children’s total monthly expenses is $4,714.48.[^115] The Husband’s position is that if he is given sole care and control, he is willing to offer a 50:50 split of the children’s expenses and seek only $2,350 from the Wife. If the Wife is given sole care and control, the Husband offers to pay $1,890 for both children in proportion to his 40% of the parties’ take-home pay.[^116]

90     When ordering maintenance for a child, the court is required to have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the factors set out in s 69(4) of the WC. In the present case, the difference in the quantifications of the children’s total monthly expenses is insignificant. It is also well within the means of the parties to share the expenses equally. As noted in _UEB v UEC_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHCF 5</span> (at \[13\]).

> While it is a very useful practice to determine whether each item in the list of expenses submitted by the Wife is a reasonable one, one should not be overly mesmerised by the approach of reaching a maintenance sum only by totalling up every item of expense as if it were a legal requirement. The law provides that the court shall take into account various factors in deciding the maintenance award. The law does not require that every specific item of expense be proved by receipts or assessed on specific values, as if on a reimbursement exercise. More exceptional expenses though, such as certain medical needs and costs, ought to be supported by evidence. A child’s needs and expenses may also fluctuate from month to month; similarly, household expenses may fluctuate over time. Setting out regular specific expenses nevertheless enables the other party and the court to assess broadly whether the expenses are reasonable. In this case, the very important factors in determining the Child’s maintenance are his needs and the financial capacity of the parents to provide for him.

91     Having regard to all the circumstances of the case, I adopt the Husband’s quantification of $4,714.48 as a rough estimate of the children’s total monthly expenses and find that a reasonable amount to be paid by the Husband as his contribution towards the maintenance of the children would be $2350 per month.

## Orders – Maintenance for the children

92     For the above reasons, I make the following orders:

> (a)     The Husband shall pay the Wife $2350 per month as his contribution towards the maintenance of the two children of the marriage;

> (b)     The payment shall be made with effect from 15 January 2020 and thereafter on the 15th day of each month into the Wife’s bank account to be designated by the Wife.

## Costs

93     I would encourage parties to agree on the issue of costs. If there is no agreement, they are to file and exchange submissions on the issue of costs within 2 weeks from the date of this judgment.
