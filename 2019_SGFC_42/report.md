Family Law – Mental Capacity Act

27 March 2019

### District Judge Toh Wee San:

## Introduction

1       This is an appeal by the Plaintiff brother (P) against my decision to dismiss his application under section 18 of the Mental Capacity Act (MCA), Chapter 177A to order the Defendant sister (D) to pay for their mother (M)’s medical bills and report/disclose Mother’s financial affairs as Mother’s donee.

## Background

2       P and D are siblings, both medically qualified and married with their own families. After the parties’ father passed away many years ago, D and her family moved into M’s house to stay with M. P and his family resided elsewhere. Subsequently D and her family migrated overseas. M followed D abroad but returned to Singapore on her own some years later. P and his family then moved in to stay with M until end 2017 when M’s property was sold and the present application was filed. In 2014, M appointed D as her sole donee under a lasting power of attorney (LPA). The LPA empowered D to act for M in all issues except to sell M’s house.

3       Around end 2017, Defendant returned to Singapore permanently. At that time, M fell ill. P admitted M into a private hospital thrice without consulting D. D was only informed much later. Parties were in conflict and disagreed over many issues including the care of M and sale of M’s property (the issues). D also got M tested and confirmed that M had lost her mental capacity. D notified P of this issue and that D was M’s donee. Around early 2018, D commenced a High Court suit (HC suit) against P for the issues. P commenced the current action against D as M’s donee to pay for M’s hospitalisation expenses and to report/account for M’s monies under D’s control.

4       After hearing parties, I dismissed P’s applications. I provide my reasons below.

## The Law

5       Section 3(5), 18(2) and 18(3) of the MCA empowers the Court to direct the donee of a LPA to act or decide in a certain way for a wide range of matters, as long as such actions or decisions were taken or made in the best interest of the donor. These matters include making decisions, rendering of reports, production of records and documents etc which such a donee has the authority to make/do. Section 6 of the MCA lays down the principles and considerations to determine a donor’s best interest. In particular, section 6(8)(c) requires the views of the donee of a LPA to be consulted if it is practical and appropriate to do so.

6       Sections 7 to 9 of the MCA deals with acts in connection with the care or treatment of the donor and related issues.

7       Clause 9.2.3(e) of the Code of Practice of the MCA (the Code) issued under section 41 of the MCA empowers the Court to direct the donee to furnish a wide range of information such as reports and accounts to the Public Guardian or the Court.

## Each party’s case in brief

8       P’s case was it was M’s wish to be admitted to a private hospital when the need arises. P produced a handwritten note by M to show M’s intent. P had fulfilled her wish by doing so and it was also in M’s best interest to do so. M was admitted to a private hospital thrice as detailed below.

9       P asserted that M had sufficient assets to meet her medical expenses and this was her wish. How-ever M’s monies were controlled by D as the donee. D refused to disclose/account for M’s monies and her utilisation to P. P also claimed to be troubled by D’s anxiety to control monies paid into the court for a separate High Court suit between parties, following the sale of M’s house. P alleged that D had neglected to arrange for M’s speedy discharge from the private hospital thereby increasing medical expenses. M was ready for discharge around 27 March 2018 but was only discharged around 20 April 2018.

10     D’s position was P had no legal basis to compel D to disclose M’s assets. D was bound by the MCA and the Code of Practice of the MCA and under such regulations, D was only required to report to the Court or the Public Guardian (PG), and not a third party. Even if P had a legitimate concern, D would report to the PG and not him.

11     D asserted that she did not agree with P that the private hospital selected was in M’s best interest. D opined that M’s wishes cannot be ascertained. Since P admitted M into his selected private hospital and contracted with the said hospital in his personal capacity, he was legally obliged to pay for those bills on his own accord. D was completely isolated from M for about 3 months, from 3 Dec 2017 to 27 Feb 2018. D was not allowed to see or speak to P and had no way of gaining access to M. P also did not consult or inform D about M’s three admissions. As early as 15 Dec 2017, D put P on official notice about M’s mental incapacity and D’s powers under M’s LPA but P chose to ignore both. D asserted that if she was consulted of M’s condition, she would have recommended another public hospital and it was this same hospital that D admitted M into after discharge from the private one. D opined that the private hospital selected for M was a not good choice as evidenced by the lack of treatment for M’s other underlying conditions. More-ever M was warded into the High Dependent Unit and not the Intensive Care Unit for one day on 15 January 2018 during her third admission and she was in the general ward for the rest of her hospital stay. D argued that this meant that M’s condition was not so bad that P had no time to contact D.

12     D further informed that as a result of P’s choice of a private hospital, M’s medi-save account had been completely depleted. Separately D informed about P’s purchase of an expensive private property costing a few million dollars and receipt of other big sums of money from M. Hence D questioned if it was morally acceptable for P to demand reimbursement from M for the hospital bills. The private hospital also permitted M to be discharged without payment of bills since they would look to P for payment. Hence D argued that she was not obliged to use M’s limited funds to reimburse P. P’s rebuttal was it was reasonable for P to believe that it was in M’s best interest to re-admit her to the same private hospital after her first admission, because the doctors there would be familiar with her medical history. On the contrary, it was impractical and unreasonable for D to require P to seek her views since it was an emergency (though disputed by D). D also acknowledged that by then, they had a very strained relationship. D’s suggestion of an alternate government hospital was an after-thought. D herself took many weeks to locate such an alternate care facility and move M there. P also argued that as M’s hospitalisation was necessary. Hence M and her donee had to pay a reasonable price for them.

## Decision and basis

13     I applied the relevant laws and was not persuaded to order D to disclose or account for M’s monies and D’s utilisation of such monies. P had no legal basis to compel or require D to carry out such reporting to him. Neither had P provided evidence that he has alerted the authorities of his concerns. Consistent with the Code, the court shall request the Public Guardian to review P’s concerns and follow up with appropriate actions, if applicable under section 32 of the MCA.

14     I was also not persuaded that I should direct D to pay the relevant medical bills incurred by M’s hospitalisation. My reasons were:

a.     D had written to P formally on 15th December 2017 to provide a medical report by an independent specialist that the mother had lost her mental capacity and to inform that D is the mother’s donee. This was not challenged by P. P is presumed to have knowledge that D has full powers and capacity to act on the mother’s behalf as set out in the LPA.

b.     P had not considered all the relevant circumstances nor taken the steps required under section 6(8) of the MCA to determine if M should be hospitalised in a private hospital. In particular, M’s handwritten note re her wish to be hospitalised in a private hospital was not conclusive. Details re the date and circumstance in which the note was prepared were lacking. P did not consult D who was contactable. I did not find P’s reasons (i.e. medical emergency and bad relationship) to be acceptable when seen in their entirety. P did not inform D about M’s medical condition for close to 3 months, until when he wanted D to bring M home and pay the bills. This did not show that P intended to consult or inform D at all.

15     On balance, I found D’s position as detailed above for not agreeing to pay the P to be reasonable.

16     I also did not find P’s case that the mother has to pay for necessary goods and services under section 9 of the Mental Capacity Act (MCA) to be made out. It was necessary for the mother to seek medical treatment for her illness, but the choice of the medical institution was another matter. P had no authority to decide on the mother’s choice of healthcare without consulting the donee. P also withheld such information from the donee for an extended period without good reasons.

17     In view of the above, I dismissed P’s applications. As cost follows the event[^1], I also ordered P to pay $2,000 (including disbursement) as costs to D.
