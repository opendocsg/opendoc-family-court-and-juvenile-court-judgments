Personal protection order, family violence

21 January 2020

### District Judge Jinny Tan:

## Introduction

1       The Complainant applied for a personal protection order (“PPO”) against the Respondent by way of SS1291/2019.

2       After hearing the evidence from both parties, and after both parties have presented their respective cases, and having considered the matter, I dismissed the Complainant’s application for a PPO.

3       The Complainant has now appealed against my decision to dismiss her application.

4       I now provide the full grounds of my decision.

## Parties

5       The Complainant was a South Korean citizen and the Respondent is a Singaporean. They met in Singapore in October 2013 and both started a relationship.

6       The Complainant came to Singapore at the end of July 2016. She became pregnant and parties then got married in Singapore on 8 November 2016.

7       Their daughter was born in April 2017, and is now about 2+ years old.

8       On 20 June 2019, the Complainant filed this application for a PPO. An expedited order was granted in her favour, as the court was satisfied that there was imminent danger of family violence being committed against her by the Respondent based on the facts stated in her complaint.

9       The Complainant has since left the house and is staying at a shelter with their daughter.

## The alleged incidents relied upon

10     Throughout these proceedings, the Complainant has changed her position in relation to the incidents she was relying upon in her application for a PPO.

11     In her complaint filed on 20 June 2019, the latest incident she relied on was the incident of 15 June 2019. She also gave brief details of past incidents, namely about the Respondent pushing her with force once a month since October 2017 and also an incident in January 2019 which caused her to return to Korea.

12     In her Affidavit, she listed a whole litany of events, and the incidents raised by her were from as early as 2016 shortly after their marriage and the birth of their daughter. She also had filed a supplementary affidavit, detailing the Respondent’s alleged breach of the expedited order.

13     In the closing submissions, the Complainant’s case was then narrowed down to three incidents - 18 October 2017, 26 December 2018 and 15 June 2019.

## Complainant’s Account and evidence

#### 18 October 2017 incident

14     The Complainant alleged that she was busy washing the baby’s laundry, and the Respondent did not help with the chores nor help look after the baby. The baby started crying and she asked him for help. The Respondent then became upset and shouted vulgarities at her. He then carried the baby into their room and tried to close the door on her. She resisted and tried to keep the door open with her arms and legs while he tried to close the door. As a result of which, she suffered bruises on her arms and legs[^1].

#### 26 December 2018 incident

15     In the Complainant’s affidavit, she was not able to state specifically the date of the incident alleged. The date of the incident was vaguely stated in her affidavit to be “sometime end December 2018”.

16     She alleged in her affidavit, that parties had an argument. The Respondent pushed her and verbally abused her using vulgarities. He then punched the wall in front of her, and she feared that he would hit her. She then left for Korea with their baby without telling him. She arrived in Korea on 1 January 2019[^2].

17     She later returned to Singapore after the Respondent flew to Korea to find her.

#### 15 June 2019 incident

18     In her affidavit, the Complainant alleged that she was cooking lunch in the kitchen, and their baby came towards the safety rail in front of the kitchen and cried for her. The Respondent asked her if he could give their baby a snack, and she said no as lunch was ready soon. The Respondent then told her that he had ordered lunch via Grab Food. She then became upset and asked why he ordered food online even though he knew she was cooking. The Respondent then became furious and kicked the safety rail.

19     She then walked out of the kitchen into the bedroom, and the Respondent took a pillow to hit her back, and slapped her once on the head. The Respondent was carrying the baby roughly and the baby cried. The Complainant panicked and tried to reach for their baby but could not reach her. When she finally managed to carry their baby in her arms, she fell on the bed, and the Respondent then slapped both of her calves multiple times. She then grabbed her handphone to try calling the police. The Respondent then grabbed the baby car mobile and threw it at her. She fended off the flying toy with her arm.

20     The Complainant then alleged that she was frightened and carried their baby and ran out of their house shouting for help along the corridor. The Respondent chased after her. A neighbour who was walking along the corridor saw them and the Complainant hid behind that neighbour. The neighbour blocked the Respondent as she stood behind their neighbour.

21     She then went into their neighbour’s house while their neighbour called the police[^3].

## Respondent’s evidence

#### 18 October 2017 incident

22     The Respondent denies any violence inflicted by him on the Complainant. He alleged that the Complainant behaved rashly and erratic and displayed alcoholic characteristics when they were living together, drinking up to 14 cans of beer a day[^4].

#### 26 December 2018 incident

23     The Respondent stated in his affidavit that in or around 26 December 2018, parties had a heated argument and a week later, she took their child and left Singapore without giving him prior notice and without seeking his consent.

24     He was frantic when he discovered that both the Complainant and their child were missing, and called the police. He was informed that the Complainant had left for Korea.

25     The Respondent then flew to Korea on 10 January 2019 to look for her and eventually found her and persuaded her to return to Singapore. Both parties and their child returned in or around mid January 2019[^5].

#### 15 June 2019 incident

26     The Respondent claimed that the Complainant’s reply to him was “are you crazy” when he had asked if he could feed their child a small piece of cookie. He thought that her reaction was out of proportion and uncalled for. Even though he was upset at her reaction, he did not kick up a fuss and instead asked what she would like to eat so that he could order food delivery for the both of them. The Complainant ignored him and then spoke to him in a rude and brusque manner. He then asked the Complainant to speak in a more cordial manner. The Complainant was agitated by what he had said and ignored him and went into the master bedroom to retrieve her luggage.

27     The Respondent then became upset and concerned when he saw that she was retrieving her luggage. He was afraid that she would leave with their child again.

28     In frustration, he then swung a pillow at her, to ask her to stop packing and leaving with their child. The Complainant jeered at him and taunted him further, saying that she knew he would lose his cool with her.

29     The Respondent was extremely upset with her and called his sister.

30     After ending the call with his sister, he went to pick their child up from the living room and held their child close to him, as he did not want the Complainant to snatch the child away. The Complainant then made several attempts to snatch their child from him, by shoving and prying his hands. He later released their child to the Complainant.

31     The Complainant then sat on the bed, and continued to jeer at him and insult him. He became frustrated, and could not exactly remember what took place during the argument, but he might have accidentally used his fingers to poke the Complainant in her head twice and accidentally slapped her calves.

32     The Complainant then jumped up from the bed, ran out of the house and into the corridor, shouting for help.

33     The Respondent denies ever throwing any toy at the Complainant on that day[^6].

## The Law

34     The court’s power to grant a PPO is stated in Section 65(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353 Rev Ed 2009). The section provides as follows:

> _The court may, upon satisfaction on a balance of probabilities that family violence has been committed or is likely to be committed against a family member and that it is necessary for the protection of the family member, make a protection order restraining the person against whom the order is made from using family violence against the family member._

35     Therefore, for the court to grant a PPO, two limbs have to be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities:-

> 1)     Family violence has been committed and is likely to be committed against the family member; and

> 2)     It is necessary for the protection of the family member for the protection order to be made.

36     The Women’s Charter also provides the definition of “family violence” and “hurt” in Section 64. It provides as follows:-

> _Family violence means the commission of any of the following acts:_

>> _a_)     _Wilfully or knowingly placing or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;_

>> _b_)     _Causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;_

>> _c_)     _Wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his or her will; or_

>> _d_)     _Causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member_

>>      _But does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age._

> _Hurt is defined as “bodily pain, disease or infirmity”._

## My decision

#### 18 October 2017 incident

37     This incident was not specifically listed in the Complainant’s application for PPO. She only raised this incident in her Affidavit.

38     Instead, what was in the Complainant’s complaint was a vague statement that the Respondent pushed her with force once a month:

> _“Since October 2017 until the last incident reported to the police, the respondent used to pushing me with force once a month.”[^7]_

39     If the Complainant was fearful of the Respondent due to various incidents including this incident, one would have expected her to specifically list this in her complaint.

40     The Complainant relied on some photographs to show that she had suffered some bruises on her arms and legs[^8]. However, these photographs do not have a time stamp on them, to show when these were taken. There are no contemporaneous documents such as medical reports, or police reports made in relation to this incident.

41     Even if the Complainant suffered some bruises, I find that the Complainant has not proven that the bruises were caused by the Respondent, and/or that the Respondent had committed family violence on her. Based on the Complainant’s evidence, what happened on 18 October 2017 appeared to be a tussle between the parties. One wanted to close the door, the other wanted to keep the door open.

42     It would appear that the bruises were likely to be caused because the Complainant herself, tried to keep the door open with her arms and legs.

43     I also found that the Complainant was not consistent in her evidence regarding this incident. In her Affidavit, the Complainant’s recount of this incident was contained in one paragraph. When asked about this incident during cross examination, the Complainant then added in details which were not even mentioned in her Affidavit.

> _Q:_      _Madam, will you --- will you not agree therefore that you had suffered bruises on your arms and your legs because of your own doing? He wanted to shut the door and you resisted it. Will you not agree with that?_

> _A:_      _When I – when I tried to kept – keep the door open, my husband pushed at me and grab my arms, my wrist and that’s when – ho—how I got hurt.[^9]_

44     Such important details regarding being grabbed by the arms and wrist should have been in her Affidavit. Yet, by leaving out such important details, and only raising it at cross examination and when confronted by the argument that the injuries she suffered are from her own doing, it would appear that the Complainant only raised this as an afterthought.

45     The Complainant therefore has not shown that the Respondent has inflicted family violence on her, or that it is likely that he will inflict family violence on her. The injuries (if any) could have been a result of the tussle between the two parties.

46     Moreover, after the incident, the Complainant and the Respondent continued to live together as a family. Parties even went to Osaka for holiday with their baby[^10].

47     It would therefore appear that the Complainant was not in fear or placed in a position of fear by the Respondent. If she was indeed fearful, she would not continue staying with the Respondent under the same roof and go on holidays with him.

#### 26 December 2018 incident

48     I found the Complainant’s evidence in relation to this incident rather vague and sketchy.

49     In her complaint, she stated that the incident happened in January 2019. She did not mention anything about the Respondent punching the wall. What she stated in her complaint regarding this was as follows:-

> “_Since October 2017 until the last incident reported to the police, the respondent used to pushing me with force once a month._

> _It happened usually after he took away our child from me and I reacted to his action by trying to take back my child._

> _Some time in January this year, the above incident happened once again. We previously discussed the matter and agreed not to be violent in front of our child and not to use violent words during our quarrel._

> _As such I went back to Korea…”[^11]_

50     From her complaint, it appears that the Complainant was alleging that the Respondent had pushed her with force and had used violent words during their quarrels.

51     In her Affidavit, the details of the incident she is now relying on were contained in one paragraph and the allegations were that the Respondent pushed her, verbally abused her and then punched the wall in front of her[^12].

52     The allegation of punching the wall, if indeed happened, is a serious one yet the Complainant did not mention it in her complaint.

53     Even in her affidavit, the Complainant’s evidence was vague and did not even provide significant details of what happened that day. If the Respondent had punched the wall, was the wall damaged, was there a hole on the wall, how loud was the sound, was his hand injured, how far away was she standing, what happened immediately after the punch, did she remain in the house, did she call the police, did she call her family members or friends? All these are significant details which the Complainant should have and could have provided in her affidavit.

54     Not only was her evidence lacking in details, the Complainant could not even confirm the date of the incident.

55     In her complaint, she stated that the incident happened in January 2019. At the witness stand, the Complainant did not at any time state that the incident happened on 26 December 2018.

56     The Complainant’s counsel, in her closing submissions, explained that since the Respondent could pinpoint the date to be 26 December 2018, the Complainant therefore took that date as the date of the incident she was referring to.

> “_… So, since by my – my client’s recollection is that she had this ar—I—arguing – ar- argument incident with the Respondent and the Respondent could pinpoint directly on the 26th December, so we follow to take the same date because thereafter she – that was the incident where she then asked to return to him that to—to get tickets and she went on to Korea – left for Korea….”_[^13]

57     If the Respondent had indeed committed family violence on the Complainant and which caused the Complainant to be fearful for her life, one would expect to the Complainant to remember the date and the event very well.

58     Therefore, I find that on a balance of probability, the Complainant has failed to prove that the Respondent has committed family violence on her, or that the Respondent is likely to commit family violence on her.

59     The evidence also did not support the Complainant’s contention that she was fearful of her life as a result of the incident as she continued to stay with the Respondent for a few days before leaving for Korea. During cross examination, the Complainant confirmed that she left for Korea a few days after the incident, and from the date of the incident to the date she left for Korea, she was living with the Respondent in the same house.

> _Q:_      _is it not true that after this incident, you left for Korea?_

> _A:_      _Yes_

> _Q:_      _but you left on 1st January 2019, correct?_

> _A:_      _So, at—exactly, I left the 31st of December which is a several days after that incident._

> _Q:_      _So you left on 31 December 2019 – 2018?_

> _A:_      _Yes_

> _Q:_      _According to your own evidence now, Madam, you said that you left only several days after the incident, correct?_

> _A:_      _Yes_

> _Q:_      _So between the day, the incident itself and the day when you left for Korea, you were living in a home with the re—with my client, correct?_

> _A:_      _right.[^14]_

60     When questioned by the Respondent’s counsel at cross examination that the Complainant was not in fear of her own safety since did not make any police report or leave home, the Complainant explained her ignorance about seeking for assistance.

> _A:_      _I was confined mostly it – in my home with the – for 3 years in Singapore. I did not known anything. I didn’t even know how to call police. I only thought I could get help from Korean government. The reason it took several days to arrange the trip was because I wanted to take a morning flight for the sake of baby[^15]_ .

61     Her explanation does not appear to be credible. She had been living in Singapore for 3 years. She would have known how to call the police. Moreover, she could have run out of the house and approach any neighbour. This was what she had done on 15 June 2019.

62     Moreover, it is undisputed that the Complainant came back to Singapore after the Respondent flew to Korea to find her. If she was indeed fearful for her life, she would not have returned to Singapore. She would have continued to stay in Korea, which was a country she was familiar with.

#### 15 June 2019 incident

63     I found that again, the Complainant’s evidence in relation to what happened, to be inconsistent.

64     In her complaint, she annexed a police report which was made on 19 June 2019. In her police report, she said that parties had a fight, the Respondent got angry, slapped her multiple times on both calves, threw a toy car at her and slapped her once on her head. In short, she alleged that the Respondent did three things to her – slapping her calves, throwing a toy car at her and slapping her head[^16].

65     In her Affidavit, she said that the Respondent kicked the safety door and the door flew into the living room. In the bedroom, he took a pillow to hit her, slapped her on her head, slapped both calves multiple times, and threw a toy car at her. So in short, she now alleged in her Affidavit that the Respondent did five things to her[^17].

66     The kicking of the safety door and the hitting her with the pillow were not mentioned in the police report, and were only mentioned in the Affidavit. The police report was made just shortly after the incident, and the events would still be fresh in her mind. If the Respondent had indeed kicked the safety door and hit her with a pillow, the Complainant would have recorded down in the police report.

67     What is clear from the evidence is that there was an argument between the parties, which resulted in the Complainant going into the master bedroom. She wanted to take her luggage and the Respondent wanted to stop her from taking the luggage and leaving Singapore. The Respondent wanted to stop a repeat of what had happened earlier in the year. There was an altercation between the parties.

68     Any father/husband would react if his wife threatens to leave the home with their child, and it is understandable if there was some physical tussle which resulted in some minor superficial injuries.

69     This is a situational conflict and does not appear that the Respondent had the intention of causing hurt onto the Complainant.

70     The Complainant sought to rely on a doctor’s memo which listed the injuries suffered by her. However, the doctor was not called as a witness. While the injuries had been noted by the doctor in the memo, the causation of the injuries has not been established. There is nothing to point to the fact that the injuries sustained were consistent to the account of the incident given by the Complainant. The injuries could have been sustained as a result of the parties shoving each other and trying to get the baby out from the spouse’s arms. It could have been sustained when she fell down onto his bed.

## Conclusion

71     Based on the above, therefore, I am dismissing the Complainant’s application for PPO as she has not proven on a balance of probabilities that family violence has been committed by the Respondent against her or that family violence is likely to be committed by the Respondent against her.

72     The Complainant’s counsel submitted that the acrimony between the parties may increase because the Complainant will be seeking maintenance from the Respondent, and that a PPO will be a form of restraint against the Respondent for causing further hurt.

73     A personal protection order is not given based on what one thinks may happen, but rather based on events that have happened. From the evidence thus far, it appears that the incidents relied upon by the Complainant were due to arguments or altercations between the parties, and the Respondent was reacting to the situation.

74     The Complainant, in her affidavit, stated that she intended to return to the matrimonial flat, and therefore hoped that the PPO would give her protection. However, even with the protection of the expedited order, the Complainant had not returned to the matrimonial flat. It therefore begs the question as to whether the Complainant has the intention of returning to the home.

75     It is clear that there are problems to be worked on in this marriage. It could be that the birth of the child has caused more stress in their marriage. It could be that the Complainant does not appreciate certain behaviour of the Respondent. To come to court to apply for a PPO, any applicant must make sure that the elements of the provisions in the Women’s Charter are satisfied and the rules of evidence apply during the trial.
