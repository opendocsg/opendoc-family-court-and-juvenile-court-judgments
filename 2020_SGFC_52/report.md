Division of matrimonial assets; spousal maintenance; costs

8 June 2020

### District Judge Jen Koh:

## Background facts

1       The parties were married in 4 December 2009. They do not have children. The wife is 37 years old and works as an administrative officer. The husband is 36 years old and works as an actuary.

2       The divorce proceedings were commenced in September 2018. The parties resolved the divorce proceedings to proceed on an uncontested basis and an Interim Judgment was granted in February 2019 on the fact of the husband’s adultery.

3       The parties could not agree on the length of the marriage.

4       The husband said that the parties resided separately since June 2018 and he asserted that this was a marriage that subsisted less than 9 years. The wife said it was a marriage that lasted 9 years and 9 months. From the date of marriage to the grant of the Interim Judgment, the marriage subsisted 9 years 2 months. I determine the length of the marriage from the date of the marriage to the date of the separation as that would be the date/period that consortium ended. The marriage therefore lasted about 8 years 6 months.

5       The ancillary matters were contested and the issues to be determined included:

> a.     Division of the former matrimonial home, a flat at Ang Mo Kio (“the flat”)

> b.     Division of matrimonial assets excluding the flat

> c.     Spousal maintenance

> d.     Costs of the proceedings.

6       The parties filed their ancillary matters affidavits, Fact and Position Sheet and Written Submissions. After hearing parties, I made the ancillary matters orders on 16 March 2020. It is against these orders that parties have appealed and I now set out the reasons for my decision.

## Operative date to determine the pool of the matrimonial assets

7       Both parties agreed that the operative date for the determination of the matrimonial pool of assets would be the date of the Interim Judgment: _ARY v ARX and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 2 SLR 686</span> at \[31\]; _BPC and BPB and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGCA 3</span> at \[26\].

## Operative date to determine the value of the matrimonial assets

8       The wife said that the value of the matrimonial assets should be the date of the Interim Judgment referring to _Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo Nancy and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 2 SLR 1157</span> at \[36\]. In the case, the Court of Appeal held that it does not follow there can be only one operative date and that multiple dates are distinctly possible depending on the nature of the assets and the circumstances surrounding the acquisition. The Court of Appeal also held that the adoption of an operative date or dates may not be that critical as compared to arriving at a just and equitable division. The wife did not elaborate her reasons for using the date of the Interim Judgment.

9       The husband submitted that the operative date for the determination of the values to be the date of the ancillary matters hearing: _USA v USB_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHCF 5</span> at \[33\]. However, for the values of bank accounts and CPF accounts, he referred to \[35\] of the case and submitted that these are unique assets in that their value is tied to the quantum of funds therein and as such these should be valued as the date of the Interim Judgment. For non-monetary assets eg the flat, this should be valued as at the date of the ancillary matters hearing.

10     The values provided by the parties of their bank accounts and other investment accounts were either February 2019 (date of the Interim Judgment) or in April 2019 the later date being the most current values before they filed their respective affidavit of assets and means. I accepted their values as provided and the parties did not raise an issue of this.

11     As for the value of the flat, both parties submitted the value to be $320,000 as at April 2019 (the parties’ Fact and Position Sheet). In submissions, the wife said that the valuation as at October 2019 was $270,000. The husband said the flat was valued at $320,000 as at February 2020. Both parties did not conduct a proper valuation of the flat. I will deal with the value of the flat further in these grounds.

## On the division of matrimonial assets

#### Pool of assets other than the flat

12     The wife’s assets were undisputed. The wife submitted that the value of her assets amounted to $363,572.47. The husband agreed with this value.

13     The parties could not agree on the value of husband’s assets. The wife said that the husband’s assets were at least $395,405.35 plus undisclosed amounts in margin accounts. The husband disagreed as the wife had included 3 disputed sums as set out in s/no 19 of her written submission (PWS) at page 11: Saizen shares amounting to $33,703.30, Ascott shares amounting to $37,507.57 and iREIT amounting to $27,662.34.

#### Wife’s submission on the husband’s margin accounts, trading accounts, shareholdings etc

14     In view of their dispute, I examined the evidence and the submissions presented by the parties.

15     The wife said that the husband had not make full disclosure of his margin accounts. She said that they had similar shareholdings in stocks and REIT (real estate investment trust) because whilst they maintained their finances separate from each other, they discussed their investments. She therefore submitted that his shareholding would be in the region of $138,455.64 (similar to hers of $135,867.67) and not the amount he declared of $34,963 in his CDP account.

16     In particular, she said that he sold his iREIT shares in October 2017 and dissipated $27,662.34 without informing her. He sold his Ascott shares in September 2018 and dissipated $37,507.57 and after the delisting of Saizen, he received and dissipated $33,703.30. The total dissipated sums amounted to $98,873.21.

17     The wife submitted that the husband deliberately made unusual repayments of his credit card bills after the divorce papers were served on him in September 2018.

18     The wife therefore asked for an adverse inference to be drawn against the husband and submitted that minimally, the sum of $98,873.21 (paragraph 16 above) be added back into the pool.

#### The husband’s reply to the wife’s allegations

19     The husband said that the wife had been unreasonable during the course of proceedings. As an example, he had furbished his bank statements with the OCBC bank but the wife challenged the format notwithstanding that the bank had changed the format and it was not something within the husband’s control. He also provided statements that he obtained through e-banking services which the wife likewise refused to accept thereby causing him to incur unnecessary expenses to produce the statements in the format that she wanted. He said that he had made disclosures in accordance with her requests and denied that he had not made full and frank disclosures.

20     He submitted that the wife did not have evidence to substantiate the allegations she made including allegedly huge withdrawals from his bank statements or making unusually large repayments of his credit card bills. He said there were no overpayment and any excess would be carried over to the next billing cycle.

21     As for the sale of shares, he explained with supporting documents as follows:

> (a)     The iREIT shares were purchased with a $18,000 loan from Citibank in April 2017 to be repaid within 6 months. The total cost of the shares inclusive administrative fees amounted to $27,000 plus $56.17. In October 2017, he sold the shares and the net proceeds of $27,662.34 were deposited into his OCBC account. He repaid the Citibank loan with interest amounting to $18,259.20. The figures as stated showed that he did not make a profit. The documents evidencing the above were exhibited in his affidavit of assets and means at pages 649 to 661 read with pages 60 and 69.

> (b)     The Ascott shares is a margins account and when sold in September 2018, the husband used the sale proceeds of $37,507.57 to repay the margin account of $12,960.09. He then transferred a sum of $24,492.80 into his OCBC account. From this sum, he paid rental arrears of $7,200, purchased Etiqua savings plan of $6,000 in November 2018, paid the wife legal costs of $6,500 in January 2019 and his legal fees of $2,190. The supporting documents were exhibited at pages 579, 582 to 584, 628, 663, 664 of his second ancillary matters affidavit.

> (c)     The Saizen shares bought a first block of these shares for $13,077.16 in February 2015 and a second block for $13,001.97 in July 2015. In March 2016, the shares were delisted and finalized in March/April 2017. The husband received 2 payments of $32,823.65 and $879.65 into his OCBC account and used a sum of $23,748.18 to purchase Starhill Global REIT. The supporting documents were produced at pages 675 and 676 of his second ancillary matters affidavit.

22     The husband submitted that he had therefore conclusively explained and traced the sale of the shares and the wife’s allegation of a dissipated sum of $98,873.21 was without merit.

#### Court’s findings of the value of the husband’s shares

23     Having considered the evidence:

> (a)     I did not accept the value of the iREIT shares to be $27,662.34 as alleged by the wife nor add this amount into the pool of matrimonial assets. The breakdown of the marriage was in June 2018 and there was no other evidence that the husband was dissipating assets and/or hiding his monies from October 2017. The husband’s sale of the iREIT share could not be said to have been contrived as this was an isolated sale. The wife did not point out other alleged dissipation during the period. There was no reason to disbelieve or discredit the husband’s account of the sale and the resultant value as set out in paragraph 21(a) above. There was therefore no value to be attributed to these shares.

> (b)     I also did not accept the value of the Saizen shares at $33,703.30 as alleged by the wife nor add this amount into the pool of matrimonial assets. The husband received the monies in March 2016 and April 2017 from the delistment and the monies less purchase of the Starhill Reit remained in his bank account. The bank balance was included as part of the matrimonial pool. There is no prejudice to the wife as the amount is considered in the Starhill Reit. To include this again would be double counting and in fact prejudicial to the husband

> (c)     As for the Ascott Reit, the timing of the sale of this was more suspect and drew an irresistible inference that it was sold because of the divorce proceedings. I included this into the pool but took into account the margin account of $12,960.09, $20 to maintain the account and $6,000 for Etiqua which appeared already as one of the husband’s asset. The amount to be clawed back into the pool would therefore be $18,492.80 ($24,492.80 less $6,000).

24     The sum total of the husband’s pool of assets was therefore $280,885.79 (see page 8 of the husband’s written submissions (DWS) plus $18,492.80 (paragraph 23(c) above) totalling $299,378.59.

## On the issue of the parties’ direct financial contribution (DFC) for the flat

25     The parties are joint tenants of a flat at Ang Mo Kio which they bought in 2011. This is a 3-room flat. According to the wife’s matrimonial property plan, this was purchased with an initial capital payment of $380,000. This is not correct as there was an outstanding mortgage on the flat in the region of about $170,000 as at October 2019. Both parties paid for the flat but their factual presentation of the DFC was at total variance with each other.

#### Cash downpayment of $63,600

26     The main issue of contention was the cash downpayment of $63,600.

#### Wife’s version

27     The wife said she paid the entire sum and elaborated this in a breakdown as set out at page 17 of PWS. The breakdown was as follows: cashier’s order of $4,000 on 28 October 2010, cash of $1,000, cashier’s order of $57,400 dated 27 December 2010 and towards the agent’s commission of $1,200. The monies came from loans from family and a friend ($15,000 which she paid off solely), monies from her accident claim and the use of foreign currencies ($2,200) which she said parties kept at home.

#### Husband’s version

28     The husband conceded that the wife paid $9,800 as this was substantiated by a deposit slip produced in page 84 of her affidavit of assets and means. As for the loan of $15,000, the husband said that both made payment and as such, half of the sum was to be attributed to each of them. With regard the foreign currencies, as this was kept in the home, he likewise submitted that a half share should be attributed to each as the monies belonged to the both of them.

29     He submitted that he contributed a sum of $17,200 and this was corroborated with a cash withdrawal from his bank account on 18 December 2010 (see pages 88 and 111 of his affidavit of assets and means). He also provided a cashier’s order of $7,529.60 dated 29 November 2010 and this was consonant with the entry detail in his bank statement at page 110 of his affidavit of assets and means.

#### Court’s findings on the issue of the cash downpayment

30     In page 9 of PBD, the wife said that the sum was $61,400. The difference was the cash sums of $1,000 for booking fee and $1,200 for agent’s commission. She said that she made the payments as evidenced in 2 cashier’s orders dated 29 October 2010 ($4,000) and 27 December 2010 ($57,400). She then submitted that she had the means to pay the amounts because of monies she had amassed between January and December 2010. Counsel however conceded that she had no direct evidence of the sums being channelled into the cashier’s orders through her bank balances ie she could not show that she had the funds she said she built up through the monies she referred to page 9 of PBD.

31     The husband said that he paid $17,200 and passed the sum to the wife on 18 December 2010. He was able to furnish the bank statement evidencing this. The date of the withdrawal was also in proximity to the completion of the purchase in December 2010. He also had evidence of payment to the conveyancing lawyers for the sum of $7,529.60. On the other payments in cash, he said it should be attributed equally. He agreed to attribute a sum of $9,800 as the wife’s contribution - substantiated by documentary evidence (cashier’s order).

32     After considering the documents and submissions, there were discrepancies in evidence which I highlighted:

> (a)     The wife said she paid $63,000 at page 17 of PWS. This must also include the sum of $9,800 referred to by the husband (see paragraph 28). The cashier’s order shows a deposit of the sum into her bank account in October 2010 which he assumed allowed her to make the payments she referred to as her contribution to the cash payment. However, the wife’s reference to this sum was that it originated from loans (from her family) that she has since repaid. There was no evidence of the repayment nor evidence of what amount was loaned from what family member. The wife was unable to explain further at the hearing.

> (b)     The wife said that she paid their friend a sum of $15,000 and referred to a deposit of $17,200 at page 9 of her PBD. However, the evidence showed that the amount was actually withdrawn from the husband’s account on 18 December 2010. This was the timeframe for the completion and as such it threw doubt on her submission that the monies came from her (as she claimed to be the only one who paid off the loan of $15,000). A further question was simply why she would deposit $17,200 (and from where) to pay a $15,000 loan. It did not add up and cast issues on her credibility. It did not help that she could not explain the discrepancy at the hearing.

> (c)     Both parties did not explain why the husband separately paid a sum of $7,529.60 to the conveyancing lawyers on 29 November 2010. There was no explanation as to whether this was part of the completion as they did not produce the completion account. However, given the proximate date, it was applied to the purchase.

> (d)     No one could inform the court the date of completion or show the completion account. The Court had no assistance on the downpayment or the completion sums.

33     Against this backdrop, I could only give credence to contributions supported by documents.

34     The following sums as supported by documents were therefore attributed accordingly:

35     I refer to page 17 of PWS. The sum of $57,400 referred to in the chart was therefore reduced by $9,800 and $17,200 = $30,400. Whilst the wife said she paid this amount, I refer to the discrepancies and issues I have raised in paragraph 32. In the absence of direct and incontrovertible evidence to the contrary, the balance sum of $30,400 would be attributed to both parties equally leading to:

## Parties’ indirect contributions

#### Indirect financial contributions

36     Both parties claimed that they contributed towards household expenses. However, the general consensus was that the husband paid the outgoings until he left and even then he continued some of these payments whilst incurring rental for alternative accommodations.

#### Indirect contributions (non-financial)

37     Not unexpectedly, both parties claimed substantive indirect contributions on their respective parts. I make a note here: both parties work fulltime and both sat for professional courses examinations. They had a part time helper for a spell.

38     The wife also related accounts of the husband’s infidelity and how he promised her the flat. The issue of the infidelity was dealt with at the divorce stage and is one of many factors the court considers in Section 114, specifically in Section 114(2). It is pertinent to note that for purposes of Section 112, the reference to Section 114 is confined to Section 114(1) leaving out the issue of conduct in the determination of division. Whilst the wife referred to this alleged agreement, in light of the husband’s position at the hearing, the wife’s retention of the flat is also subject to the legal principles. Accordingly, I placed little weight on this ‘promise’ given the emotional volatility between the parties upon the discovery of the husband’s infidelity.

## On the issue of liabilities

39     The wife has submitted that her legal costs is a liability that is to be deducted. On the issue of deducting legal costs as a legitimate liability, there is authority to say that this is not desired. In _AQT v AQU_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGHC 138</span>, the Court held that it was ‘highly unusual’ for legal fees to be deducted from the pool of matrimonial assets as it would set an ‘unwise precedent’. I therefore did not agree with the wife’s submission on this issue.

## The division award

40     The pool of matrimonial assets is therefore as set out:

\*corrected from the figures at the hearing and decision

41     As set out in paragraph 11, both parties did not conduct a valuation on the flat and they were then invited to submit on the values. The Plaintiff then submitted a value of $270,000 and said that it could be as low as $230,000. She had no supporting documents to substantiate her submission of the value. In the absence of any other valuation, the Court therefor relied on the HDC Resale Flat Prices as provided by the Defendant. The Court took the average of the resale transactions for flats in the levels similar to the flat in issue: $320,000 and $335,000 in June 2019. The average of the resales transactions prices was $327,500 and this was the value that I used.

42     Both parties had also given different values for the outstanding loan.  I took the latest figure to achieve a just and equitable result and this appeared to be $165,958.41. The net value of the flat was thus $161,541.59. The wife’s share was 43.7% (see paragraph 35 for derivation of her DFC) amounting to $70,593.67 and the husband’s share (56.3%) was $90,947.92.   

43     Applying the structured approach as set out in _ANJ v ANK \[2015\]_ 4 SLR 1043, I first expressed a ratio to the parties’ direct contributions relative to each other, having regard to the amount of financial contributions each party made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets. I arrived at the following percentages:

44     I then expressed a second ratio of the parties’ indirect contributions relative to each other, having regard to both parties’ financial and non-financial indirect contributions as well as considered the weightage to be ascribed to DFC _vis a vis_ the indirect contributions and whether adjustments should be made taking into account the other relevant factors of Section 113 or Section 114(1) of the Women’s Charter, Cap 353. I found as set out below:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="0"><colgroup><col width="10.46%"> <col width="20.8%"> <col width="11.06%"> <col width="15.22%"> <col width="42.46%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>S/No:</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Item</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Wife</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Husband</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Remarks (if any)</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DFC</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">52.7%</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">47.3%</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Indirect contributions&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">50%</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">50%</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">I am of the view that the husband contributed more than the wife for indirect financial contributions but that the wife may have done more housework and the like (indirect non-financial contributions).&nbsp; The authorities now state that the court should not differentiate the two spheres of indirect contributions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As this was an equal division was fair in the circumstances.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">I was also not minded to adjust the weightage as there was no particular reasons to do so.

45     The husband’s share is thus 49% of $662,930.01 ($824,471.65 less $161,541.59 as this is a value used for DFC percentage and not to be added as a value of the parties’ assets) = $324,835.70.  As he retains $299,378.59, the balance due to him is $25,457.11\* (\*corrected from the hearing and the decision because of the final figure at paragraph 40).

46     As the wife indicated that she wished to retain the flat, she was given the right of first refusal to do so by paying to the husband his share. I also included an alternative order in the event that the wife was unable to satisfy HDB’s eligibility conditions to retain the flat.

## On the issue of maintenance for the wife

#### Parties’ positions on the issue of the wife’s maintenance

47     The wife said that she required maintenance from the husband for several reasons. These reasons included: that she sacrificed her career and rejected opportunities for betterment to prepare for motherhood at the husband’s request; that she was suffering from depression as a result of the discovery of his infidelity; that she incurred medical expenses as a result thereof; that she required long term treatment for her depression and that the husband had promised to support her, even promising her the flat. She was concerned that she would lose her job and she had been assigned a reduced role at work as a result of her depression.

48     She sought an order for lump sum maintenance of $320,000 at the rate of $2,000 per month over a period of 10 years and including backdated maintenance of $2,500 over a period of 8 months (when the husband left the flat). Alternatively, she sought periodic monthly maintenance of $2,500 per month.

49     She submitted that the husband was in a position to pay maintenance including the backdated maintenance amount she sought because his expenses of $7,450 per month were exaggerated and that his income was $10,227.35 per month to her $5,588 per month.

50     The husband said that the wife earns a good income of about $8,000 per month, has a professional qualification, a good career and is more than capable of earning a good living and providing for herself. He submitted that her expenses were excessive and that she had inflated many of the expenses of $9,262 per month. He submitted there should be no orders as to maintenance for the wife. Although she claimed to have been demoted or performing a reduced role at work, there was in fact no change to her income.

#### Court’s findings and decision on this issue

51     The wife was about 36 years old when she filed the divorce in 2018. She would be about 38 years old in 2020. In her affidavit of assets and means, she listed her occupation as an Accountant. She elaborated that she was working as an Analyst until April 2019 and since then she was given light administrative duties. She declared her income to be in the region of $6,490 gross per month with a take home pay of $5,288 per month. She said that she was ‘demoted’ as a result of her mental state brought about by the discovery of the husband’s infidelity.

52     The husband was about 35 years old when the proceedings were filed. He would be 37 years old in 2020. The husband works as an Actuary and declared his income to be $9,300 gross per month with a take home pay of $8,097 per month. His expenses were declared at $7,450 per month.

#### The parties’ incomes

53     I evaluated both parties’ incomes on the documents provided.

54     Premised on her Notice of Assessment for 2018, the wife’s assessable income was $95,853 or $7,983.33 per month (see page 29 of her affidavit of assets and means). However, on examination of her payslip, the year to date (YTD) income for December 2018 exhibited on page 23 of her affidavit of assets and means showed income of $77,240 as ordinary wages and $23,640 for additional wages amounting to $100,880 for 2018. The wife was unable to explain what these additional wages were for and why the amount on the payslip in December 2018 for the year 2018 ($100,880) differed from her Notice of Assessment 2018 ($95,853). Even without considering what the additional wages were, her ordinary wages of $77,240 for 2018 amounted to $6,500 per month.

55     As for the husband, his Notice of Assessment for 2018 showed $103,276 and this averages $8,606.33 per month. We went through his payslips at page 559 of his second ancillary matters affidavit which showed an income of $8,245 per month. Because the wife insisted that his income was more than $10,000 per month, we went through more payslips which showed his pay for January 2019 to be $7,966.26, February to be $7,997, March to be $8,257, April to be $8,297 and the same for May and June. On an average, his income was $8,000 per month.

56     I therefore made a finding that the wife’s income was in the region of $6,500 per month and the husband’s income was in the region of $8,000 per month. I also noted to parties that despite a reduction in her duties at work, the wife did not suffer a reduction of income/pay.

#### The parties’ expenses

57     In order to assess her needs, I went through the wife’s expenses. I found her expenses to be on the high side. In particular, I found the following expenses to be inflated: $800 per month for eating out expenses, $500 per month for clothes, shoes, gym wear, $400 per month for hair care, $1000 per month for travel expenses and $600 per month for transport to and from work. She also listed course fees of $400 per month and described these as IT courses and personal interest courses suggested by her therapist. This appeared to be something that she was contemplating as there were no further details and would not be a recurrent expense nor could this be considered a necessity. She said she was giving her mother a monthly allowance of $1,000 but there was no indication of this in her bank statements. Further, if she was struggling with her expenses, she could perhaps speak with her mother on the struggle and consider a reduced sum for a spell.

58     A further sum of $1,900 per month was listed for her psychiatrist and psychological expenses and other miscellaneous expenses. However, as pointed out by the husband, an examination of the supporting documents showed that the average expense for this item was about $792.70 per month and not $1,900 per month.

59     On the whole, the total monthly expense listed by the wife of $9,262 was extravagant and inflated.

60     On a reasonable estimate, the wife’s monthly expenses in my assessment would be $3,500 to $4,000. Her medical/dental bills should be covered by her company and the only odd item in this description was the psychiatrist bills. I disallowed the legal costs as this was not a monthly recurrent expense. The allowance to her mother was within her control as well. As she was providing for travel and going to the gym as well as undergoing courses, it would appear that the depression had not so crippled her that she could not get around and up and about. Let me make it clear that I in no way belittle her issues; I have no doubt that she is in great emotional pain but what I assess was the frequency and continued provision of this expense for the purpose of her maintenance claim.

61     I also had to consider the various factors as set out in Section 114 of the Women’s Charter, Cap 353. Her income remained steady and contrary to her assertion that she was at risk of losing her job, she was paid her ‘normal’ pay for a ‘reduced’ role. I had considered her expenses as set out in paragraphs 57 to 59 above. The wife also set out in her affidavit that parties kept their finances apart and that they paid for different items in the marriage.

62     In the same vein, I was of the view that the husband’s expenses were inflated and many of these expenses were unnecessarily high. He listed food, beverages, groceries, transport and utilities bills to be $1,600 per month. He provided a sum of $650 per month as retirement savings and this really could not be considered an expense. As for the fees for his actuarial examination and study material at $400 per month, this was not a monthly recurrent expense. With the division of the flat, he may no longer have to incur $1,500 per month as rental income. On a reasonable estimate, the husband’s monthly expenses in my assessment would be $3,500 to $4,000.

## Decision on the issue of maintenance

63     The crux of the matter is simply whether the husband was in a position to pay maintenance and whether the wife requires it bearing in mind her income and expenses. Maintenance is ordered because there is necessity to do so. It is not meant to pad up a spouse’s income nor used for luxuries or non-necessities. The quantum ordered therefore is really dependent on the facts of each case.

64     Having considered the matter and the facts of this particular case as well as the factors of Section 114, I am of the view that the husband should pay some form of maintenance to the wife but limited in terms of quantum as well as period. The wife’s largest expense appeared to be her medical fees. Having considered the circumstances, I was of the view that the husband should assist her with this expense for her psychiatrist upon production of receipts on a monthly basis. I ordered this as her visit to the psychiatrist was directly referable to the conduct which led to the breakdown of the marriage. The husband is to be responsible for this expense capped at a monthly sum of $1,000 for a period of 1 year with effect from March 2020. To clarify, the husband shall pay the sums as invoiced up to a monthly cap of $1,000. The maintenance liability shall cease after the expiry of 1 year.

65     As for the wife’s claim for backdated maintenance, having found that she did not require monthly maintenance, I was not minded to order backdated maintenance. The wife stayed on in the flat with the husband continuing to pay some of the outgoings. That was a contribution from him to her in that sense. Having assessed the parties’ incomes and expenses, there was no necessity for backdated maintenance.

## Costs of the proceedings

66     I had referred parties to the Court of Appeal decision of _Tham Khai Meng v Nam Wen Jet Bernadette_ \[1997\]1 SLR(R) 336 in which the Court of Appeal held the ancillary matters flowed from the divorce and ordered the husband who committed adultery to pay the costs of the ancillary matters. There has been a deliberate movement away from the principles therein in view of the ethos of family justice with the set up of the Family Justice Courts in 2014. Much depends on the facts of the individual case and how parties had conducted themselves throughout the proceedings eg delays in filing affidavits, dissipation of assets which led to tracing, lack of disclosure.

67     I did not find any misconduct by the husband in the course of these proceedings notwithstanding the wife’s assertions as to the lack of full and frank disclosure on the husband’s part, which she was unable to substantiate. The husband also fired his own salvo against the wife as to her alleged non-disclosures and her litigious conduct in these proceedings. I was not minded to award costs in the circumstances in the hopes that parties can salve their wounds and attempt to move on.

68     This was a case in which the facts warranted the parties to bear their own legal costs.
