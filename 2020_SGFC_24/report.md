Family law – Enforcement of maintenance order – Women’s Charter (Cap. 353), section 71 – Application of section 121(3) of Women’s Charter (Cap. 353)

18 February 2020

### District Judge Guy Ghazali:

## Introduction

1       This is an application by the Complainant for enforcement of a maintenance order in an Interim Judgment dated 4 July 2011 (“the Interim Judgment”). The maintenance order is for the benefit of the Complainant and the parties’ two children, aged, 14 and 10 years.

2       The relevant paragraph of the Interim Judgment, namely, paragraph 3(2) is reproduced below:-

> _“2_.     _The \[Respondent\] shall pay monthly maintenance of the sum of $2,000-00 each for the two (2) children of the said marriage and the sum of $1-00 to the \[Complainant\] commencing on the 1st day of the calendar month from the date of this Order of Court by way of the \[Respondent\] depositing the sum of $4,001-00 on or before the 1st day of each succeeding calendar month into the \[Complainant’s\] Standard Chartered Bank Account No. xxxx xx9 663 with Ion Orchard Branch”._

3       The above order was made by the consent of the parties.

4       The Complainant claimed arrears in the sum of $271,085.00 in her Complaint. In her affidavit that was filed later, this sum was revised to $258,012.20. In the Wife’s Counsel’s written submissions, the final sum claimed was $273,779.60.

5       For her maintenance, the Complainant claimed arrears from May 2016. As for the children’s maintenance, the Complainant claimed arrears from August 2011 (less deductions that were considered to be acceptable by the Complainant). It was the Complainant’s Counsel’s submissions that whilst section 121(3) of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353) applied to wife’s maintenance, it did not extend to children’s maintenance. The Complaint was filed on 12 April 2019.

6       Section 121(3) of the Women’s Charter reads:-

> _“(3_)     _No amount owing as maintenance shall be recoverable in any suit if it accrued due more than 3 years before the institution of the suit unless the court, under special circumstances, otherwise allows.”_

7       The Respondent took the position that there were no arrears due or to be enforced by the court.

## Preliminary issue on the applicability of section 121(3) of the Women’s Charter on children’s maintenance

8       I will deal first with the preliminary issue as to whether section 121(3) of the Women’s Charter applies to children’s maintenance. As set out above, it was the Complainant’s Counsel’s submissions that whilst section 121(3) of the Women’s Charter applied to wife’s maintenance, it did not apply to children’s maintenance. The Respondent’s Counsel submitted that section 121(3) of the Women’s Charter applied to children’s maintenance as well.

9       I accept the Respondent’s Counsel’s argument that section 121(3) is also applicable to children’s maintenance. My reasons are as follows.

10     The present order for the maintenance of the children is part of the ancillary matters orders made in the divorce suit. Hence, it is an order made under section 127 of the Women’s Charter. The said provision reads:

> _“127. - (1_)     _During the pendency of any matrimonial proceedings or when granting or at any time subsequent to the grant of a judgment of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage, the court may order a parent to pay maintenance for the benefit of his child in such manner as the court thinks fit._

> (_2_)     _The provisions of Part VIII and IX shall apply, with the necessary modifications, to an application for maintenance and a maintenance order made under subsection (1).”_

11     The provisions of Part VIII therefore apply (with the necessary modifications) to a maintenance order made under section 127(1).

12     One of the provisions under Part VIII is section 74. Section 74 reads:

> _“74_.     _Section 121 shall apply, with the necessary modifications, to any order for the payment of maintenance under this Part.”_

13     Reading section 127(2) with section 74, I am of the view that section 121 applies, by “modification”, to orders made under section 127(1).

14     In my view, this interpretation is reasonable. The present maintenance order is an order made under section 127(1) as there was a divorce and the maintenance for the children was resolved as part of the ancillary matters. If there were no divorce, the order for children’s maintenance would have been sought and made under section 69(2) of the Women’s Charter. Similarly, for Muslim parties whose divorce is dealt with by the Syariah Court, the divorcing or divorced parties will seek an order for children’s maintenance from the Family Justice Courts under section 69(2) of the Women’s Charter. For these two scenarios that I have stated, section 121 clearly applies by virtue of the express language of section 74 (as section 69(2) is a provision under Part VIII).

15     Additionally, section 121, by virtue of section 74, also applies to maintenance orders made under section 69(1) (which is a provision under Part VIII). Section 69(1) relates to orders for the maintenance of a wife or an incapacitated husband.

16     As section 121 is one of the provisions under Chapter 4 of the Women’s Charter (Financial Provisions consequent on Matrimonial Proceedings), it also clearly applies to orders made under section 113 (which is a provision under the same Chapter). Section 113 relates to the power of the court to order maintenance to a wife or an incapacitated husband in the course of any matrimonial proceedings as well as to a former wife or an incapacitated former husband at the granting of or subsequent to the grant of a judgment of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage. These are orders made, not under section 69(1) of the Women’s Charter, but in matrimonial proceedings such as a divorce suit. These orders can be interim maintenance orders, maintenance orders made as part of the ancillary matter proceedings or subsequent variation of these orders.

17     Accordingly, if the Complainant’s Counsel’s submissions were to be accepted, it would appear that a maintenance order made under section 127(1) would be the only anomaly where the restriction imposed by section 121(3) does not apply. This, in my mind, cannot be the intent of section 121(3).

18     In the circumstances, and considering that the Complainant had not established “special circumstances” that would allow a recovery of arrears beyond 3 years before the institution of her complaint, the Complainant could only recover arrears from May 2016 onwards. Her complaint was filed on 12 April 2019.

19     The following paragraphs will therefore be focused on facts that occurred after May 2016.

## Payments made by the Respondent to the Complainant

20     The Complainant’s evidence was as follows:

> i.     The Respondent paid $3,000 per month from May 2016 until January 2017, both months inclusive.

> ii.     No further payment was made thereafter, until July 2017.

> iii.     The Respondent paid $935 for July 2017 maintenance.

> iv.     Maintenance for August 2017 was unpaid.

> v.     The Respondent paid $3,000 for September 2017 maintenance.

> vi.     Maintenance for October 2017 and November 2017 was unpaid.

> vii.     The Respondent paid $3,000 per month for December 2017 and January 2018 maintenance.

> viii.     No payment was made thereafter, until April 2019.

> ix.     The Respondent paid $4,001 per month from April 2019 onwards per the maintenance order.

21     It is noted that the Complainant did not seek arrears for April 2019 onwards. On the Complainant’s case, the Respondent had paid her a total sum of $36,935 from May 2016 until March 2019.

22     Based on the Respondent’s evidence, he had paid $37,695 during this period. However, in the Respondent’s calculation, he had included two additional deductions. The first is a sum of $300, which appears to be expenses related to the younger child’s birthday party. The second is a sum of $460, being the Respondent’s reimbursement payment to the Complainant. The Complainant had planned a trip to Bintan for the children. She paid for the expenses in advance but was unable to go for the trip at the last minute. The Respondent voluntarily took her place and reimbursed her for the expenses that had been paid.

23     In my determination of arrears, I have not included these two deductions, as they do not fall within the scope of the maintenance order. I have however taken into account the total sum of $36,935 that had been paid by the Respondent from May 2016 until March 2019.

## The email dated 19 November 2014 from the Complainant to the Respondent

24     Parties agreed that from May 2016 until January 2017 (both months inclusive), the Respondent only paid $3,000 per month towards maintenance and not $4,001 per month as required under the maintenance order. In fact, if we look at the evidence for the period preceding May 2016, the Respondent was paying $3,000 per month from November 2014.

25     According to the Respondent, there was a variation of the maintenance order, by the agreement of the parties. In this regard, the Respondent relied on the Complainant’s email dated 19 November 2014 to the Respondent. The email _inter alia_, reads:

> _“As per our conversation last weekend (when you were staying in my house). You are required to continue paying for the children’s insurance (that you are currently paying). And you can stop payment for \[the children’s\] Learning Lab through your credit card, I will take over their Learning Lab payment and \[the elder child’s\] new Maths home tutor. However, I require the SG$3,000 monthly maintenance to be given to me from November onwards. This weekend, kindly give me the next 6 months in post dated cheques. 1st day of each month please.”_

26     According to the Respondent, the above email amounted to a variation of the maintenance order from $4,001 per month to $3,000 month.

27     The Complainant contended that she was under a mistaken belief that the maintenance amount was $3,000 per month as that was the amount mentioned by the Respondent in their conversations. She maintained that there was no intention to vary the maintenance order. According to the Complainant, she was too distraught at that time, due to the events that were happening then, to verify whether the maintenance amount was $3,000 or otherwise. It was also the Complainant’s testimony that she only realised what the actual sum was (namely, $4,001 per month) after she consulted lawyers in 2019. By way of her former solicitors’ letter dated 21 March 2019 to the Respondent’s solicitors, the Complainant expressly informed the Respondent that “no such agreement was reached between the parties to vary the monthly maintenance to S$3,000.00”.

28     Whilst I am of the view that the Complainant’s email dated 19 November 2014 did not amount to a variation of the maintenance order, it would appear from the parties’ subsequent conduct that they both accepted (whether under the Complainant’s alleged mistaken belief or otherwise) that the amount payable was $3,000, until at least March 2019 when the Complainant’s former solicitors clarified that there was no agreement to vary the maintenance order. With regard to the Complainant’s position that she was operating under a mistaken belief, I am of the view that the Complainant could have verified the amount simply by referring to the Interim Judgment but she chose not to. As a result, for a period of almost 4.5 years, both parties conducted themselves on the basis that only a sum of $3,000 per month was due and payable to the Complainant.

29     In the circumstances, I am of the view that it will not be equitable to enforce more than $3,000 per month during the period from May 2016 until March 2019 (less the amounts paid during this period).

## The Respondent’s claims for set-offs

30     The Respondent claimed that during the period from May 2016 until April 2019 (although the Complainant’s claim is only until March 2019), he has made various payments for the children. This included a total sum of $74,210.75 for the children’s insurance premiums, a total sum of $11,474 for the children’s medical and therapy and a total sum of $62,033.30 for the children’s education and miscellaneous expenses. The Respondent therefore asked for these amounts to be deducted from the arrears.

31     The Complainant objected to the Respondent’s claim for set-offs.

32     It is not disputed that the children’s various insurance policies have been in existence since the time of the Interim Judgment. Despite this, the payments for the insurance premiums were not provided for and included in the Interim Judgment. Instead, at all material times, the issue of payment for the children’s insurance policies was governed by a separate arrangement between the parties. This is demonstrated by the Complainant’s email dated 19 November 2014 to the Respondent. The email, which was sent more than three years after the Interim Judgment was made, _inter alia_, reads:

> _“There are insurance being purchased for both girls to assure that when they both turn 18 years old, they have a sum of money to fund their way to University. I started paying their insurance from the start when they were born. You started to chip in 2020 and one in 2014. I looked at the report which was sent to me from Prudential due (sic) your inquiry. And I did a calculation of the contribution we both made towards our Children’s insurance._

> _To date: you have paid about $59,315. And I have paid about $89,477._

> _Shall we split the difference of $30,000 then between us since I believe your earlier email to me was about how I am paying $441 lesser than you per month?_

> _The $30,000 difference which I have paid in the past would be more than 88 months of the difference ($441) you are asking me to pay for now._

> _So kindly advise me what do you want to do now? You have had a much better end of the bargain and you never even realised it.”_

33     This separate arrangement can also be gleaned from the shift in payment responsibilities that has taken place independent of the maintenance order. For instance, the Respondent was originally paying for five of the children’s 15 insurance policies. Pursuant to a change in arrangement between the parties, he is now paying for only two of these policies.

34     It was also the Complainant’s position that payment for the insurance policies should not be viewed as maintenance for the children. The two policies that the Respondent is continuing to pay are in his name. When these policies mature in the next few years, there is a possibility that the Respondent will retain these monies for his own use instead of utilising them for the benefit of the children.

35     Having considered the evidence, I have not accepted the Respondent’s claim for set-off in respect of the payments that he has made towards the children’s insurance premiums as they do not fall within the scope of the maintenance order.

36     As for the other payments that the Respondent has paid towards the children’s expenses (medical and therapy, education and miscellaneous expenses), I have also not taken these into account in determining the arrears payable. Although I note that the Respondent has made these payments over and above his obligations under the Interim Judgment, there was no agreement or mutual understanding between the parties that these payments would be accepted as proper payments under the Interim Judgment. In my view, a party cannot voluntarily and unilaterally make payment of a separate expense (not provided for under a maintenance order) only to thereafter deduct it from his obligation under the maintenance order.

37     I have nevertheless taken into account the Respondent’s payments towards the elder child’s school fees in an international school (for the equivalent secondary level). While the present maintenance order did not contemplate or envision the children’s school fees on the basis of international school (as the children attended local primary school), I note from the Complainant’s oral testimony that the maintenance amount was intended to cover, among other things, school fees. It was the Complainant’s testimony that there was an agreement for the Respondent to bear the elder child’s international school fees while she would bear the younger child’s international school fees (after the younger child has completed local primary school). Although the Respondent denied that there was such an agreement, I note that the elder child is no longer attending international school but is homeschooled while the younger child is still in primary school. Taking the Complainant’s case at its highest, there appears to have been an agreement between the parties that the children’s international school fees were to be borne equally between them (except that it was arranged in a manner that each parent would be responsible for one child’s school fees). Even if the younger child will be enrolled in an international school in the future (after she has completed her local primary school education), in the absence of an agreement as to how the international school fees will be apportioned between the parties, the Complainant may apply for a variation of the present maintenance order to have this issue determined. However, with regard to the elder child’s international school fees that have already been paid by the Respondent, the Complainant has not contributed her share.

38     In the circumstances and considering that the maintenance order is intended to cover school fees, I am of the view that it is only fair for half of the international school fees that have been borne by the Respondent to be set off from the arrears that are outstanding. As the total fees paid are $54,976.50, half of this works out to $27,488.25.

39     In addition to the above expenses, the Respondent claimed to have made a total payment of $102,268.01 towards his Audi A8 car loan instalment payments. The car was in the Respondent’s name. However, the Respondent relied on paragraph 3(7) of the Interim Judgment, which reads:

> _“7_.     _The motor car, an Audi A8, bearing registration No. \[number redacted\] registered in the name of the \[Respondent\] shall be delivered to the \[Complainant\] for her use free from payment for which the \[Complainant\] will take over solely the servicing of the loan from Citibank Singapore Ltd.”_

40     It is not disputed that the Complainant was paying for the car loan instalment payments until February 2015 when she ceased payment. From the evidence, it was established that the Complainant had ceased use of the car from February 2015 and the car was used by and/or in the possession of the Respondent.

41     I am of the view that based on the express language of paragraph 3(7) of the Interim Judgment, the Complainant is obliged to pay for the car as long as she has use of the car. It therefore follows that if she is not provided with the use of the car, she is not obliged to make the payment. Accordingly, I have not accepted the Respondent’s claim for set-off in respect of the car loan instalment payments that he had made for the car which he had the benefit of using to the exclusion of the Complainant.

## Determining the arrears

42     Pursuant to my finding in paragraph \[29\] above, the total amount payable by the Respondent towards maintenance from May 2016 until March 2019 is $105,000 ($3,000 x 35 months). Taking into account the total sum of $36,935 that has been paid by the Respondent during this period and deducting the Complainant’s share of $27,488.25 for the elder child’s international school fees, the arrears are $40,576.75.

43     I have ordered for the above sum of $40,576.75 to be paid in one lump sum within three months of my order, namely, by 4 February 2020.

44     I am satisfied on the evidence that the Respondent is capable of making this payment. He is a sole director of an established company in Malaysia. Even though the Respondent claims that he has not been drawing a salary from the company for the last 7 years, the company reimburses him for his personal and business expenses. He is a member of a global organisation of business leaders. He travels for business forums and corporate retreats, which his company pays for. Based on the Respondent’s expenses, the Respondent has also demonstrated an ability to bear significant expenses, including the elder child’s international school fees.

## Costs

45     The Complainant’s Counsel sought costs in the sum of $10,000. The Respondent submitted that there should be no order as to costs but if this court was minded to order costs in favour of the Complainant, it should only be $2,000.

46     I am of the view that no order as to cost is appropriate in the circumstances, especially given that the amount eventually enforced is significant less than the amount originally claimed by the Complainant.
