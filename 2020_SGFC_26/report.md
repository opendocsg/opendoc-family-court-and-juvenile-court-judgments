Family Law – Ancillaries – Matrimonial Assets – Custody – Maintenance

28 February 2020

### District Judge Lo Wai Ping:

## Background

1       This case concerned a marriage of about 11 years. The parties were married in India in May 2006. Shortly thereafter, the Defendant-wife (“**Wife**”) came over to Singapore to join the Plaintiff-husband (“**Husband**”). She gave birth to a son in February 2007 and a daughter in March 2012 (“**Children**”). The Children will turn 13 and 8 this year.

2       The Husband and Wife are permanent residents of Singapore but retained their Indian citizenship. Both are university graduates. The Husband (in his early forties) is a software manager whilst the Wife (in her late thirties) is an accountant.

3       In January 2008, the Husband bought a 4 -room HDB flat that was registered under his sole name (“**Matrimonial Home**”). At the time of the purchase of the Matrimonial Home, the Wife was not working and away in India. She had returned to India in December 2006 to prepare for the delivery of her son there. In February 2008, she returned to Singapore with the son (who was 1-year old by then) and the family have been staying in the Matrimonial Home since. She started working in September 2010 and was working full-time at the time of the hearings before me.

4       Although the family was staying together in the Matrimonial Home, it was not disputed that parties’ marital relationship had become strained by 2012. By 2015, parties had commenced proceedings against each other in India and in Singapore. In Singapore, the Wife had commenced proceedings (“**OSG 127/2015**”) against the Husband under the Guardianship of Infants Act (Cap 122). In April 2016, a consent order was recorded in OSG 127/2015 that parties would have joint custody, care and control of the Children. In 2016, the Wife had also obtained maintenance orders against the Husband under section 69 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353). Thereafter, there were other proceedings taken out by each party against the other. Suffice to say, by 2017, their relationship was acrimonious.

5       In February 2017, the Husband commenced these divorce proceedings and interim judgment for the divorce of the parties was granted in June 2017 on an uncontested basis (“**Interim Judgment**”) on both the Husband’s claim as well as the Wife’s counterclaim. Both claims were premised on the unreasonable behaviour of the other party.

6       Following Interim Judgment and pending the hearing of the ancillary matters (“**AM Hearing**”), an order of court was granted on 8 February 2018 in these divorce proceedings setting out, amongst other things, how parties were to share in the maintenance of the Children and the common household expenses including the maid’s expenses. Consent orders were also recorded on that date that parties were to continue, in the interim, with their joint custody, care and control of the Children. Thereafter, parties filed further applications even though they were already in the midst of preparing for the AM Hearing. It was agreed at case conference that the matters set out in these further applications would be considered with the ancillary matters at the AM Hearing and directions were given accordingly.

7       I heard the ancillaries over several sittings, starting from 22 March 2019 and on 30 August 2019, I made orders (the “**Relevant Orders**”) relating to:

> (a)     the division of the matrimonial assets;

> (b)     the custody, care and control of the Children;

> (c)     the maintenance of the Wife;

> (d)     the maintenance of the Children; and

> (e)     the payment of an agreed sum of $4,643.20 by the Wife to the Husband, as the net maintenance sum payable under the aforementioned order of court dated 8 February 2018 (“**Interim Order**”), for the period from February 2018 to July 2019.

Both parties were legally represented. They appealed against some of the orders set out in the Relevant Orders.[^1] For convenience, any reference to a particular Order number shall refer to the corresponding order set out in the Relevant Orders.

## Orders appealed against

8       Both Husband and Wife appealed against the entire Order 1 relating to the division of the pool of matrimonial assets in the ratio of 58 (Husband): 42 (Wife). Under Order 1, to effect this division, the Husband was permitted to retain the Matrimonial Home and he was ordered, _inter alia_, to transfer a certain amount from his CPF account(s) to the Wife’s CPF account(s) and to make a cash payment to the Wife. The Wife also appealed against Orders 3, 4 and 5. As will be shown below, these orders were not substantive orders but were orders made consequential upon and for the operation of Order 1.

9       The parties did not appeal against Order 2 which stated that (save as set out in Order 1), parties were to retain all their other matrimonial assets held in their respective names and possession.

10     The parties did not appeal against Order 6 which stated that there was to be no maintenance for the Wife.

11     On the issue of the Children’s custody, the parties had agreed to joint custody of the Children as set out in Order 7.

12     Order 8 dealt with the issue of care and control of the Children. It provided that the parties were to continue to have shared care and control of the Children and that with effect from 1 December 2019, the Children were to reside with the Husband and the Wife in their respective homes in accordance with the terms set out in Orders 8(a) to (j).

13     The parties did not appeal against the order granting them shared care and control of the Children. However, there were appeals by one or both parties against the following orders relating to the exercise of their shared care and control of the Children:

> (a)     Order 8(b): Arrangements during term breaks and school holidays;

> (b)     Order 8(d): Arrangements whenever each parent was away from Singapore for a period of 5 consecutive days or more during his or her allocated care period;

> (c)     Order 8(f): Arrangements whenever each parent took the Children overseas during his or her allocated care period, and

> (d)     Order 8(g): Arrangements relating to the keeping of the Children’s passport and other important documents.

14     As for the orders relating to the maintenance of the Children, these were set out in Orders 9 to 15. Both parties appealed against Order 11 where I had ordered that the expenses listed therein were to be shared by them in the ratio of 60 (Husband): 40 (Wife). There were no appeals against the other orders made in connection with the maintenance for the Children.

15     Both parties also appealed against the entire Order 16 which concerned the outstanding maintenance (as agreed) owing under the Interim Order.

16     I will set out below the reasons for my decision on the orders that were appealed by the Husband and or the Wife. However, before doing so, I wish to set out some additional background information relating to this case:

> (a)     Before these divorce proceedings were commenced in Singapore by the Husband in 2017, the Husband had commenced divorce proceedings in India in July 2015 and according to the Wife, these proceedings were still ongoing at the time of the hearing of the ancillaries. The Husband did not deny this.

> (b)     For the ancillaries, there were allegations and counter-allegations of non-full disclosure of assets, some in India. A total of 12 affidavits were filed by the parties inclusive of their affidavits of assets and means (“**AOMs**”) - 5 by the Husband and 7 by the Wife. Some of these were filed by the parties (during the hearings) to provide further evidence mainly in relation to the allegations of the non-full disclosure of assets. The Wife’s father and the Husband’s mother had also filed affidavits. Parties had also taken up discovery proceedings and served interrogatories against each other.

> (c)     For the purposes of the hearing of the ancillaries, the parties filed written submissions before the date of the first hearing in March 2019. However, in the course of the hearings, certain adjustments and changes were made to their original positions set out in the written submissions. I took the positions that were submitted to the court during the hearings as the final positions of the parties.

## Division of Matrimonial Assets

17     During the hearings, both counsel accepted that the date of Interim Judgment (i.e. 28 June 2017) was the operative date for determining whether an asset fell within the pool of matrimonial assets for division.

18     As for the valuation of the matrimonial assets, there was no dispute that the hearing date for the ancillary matters was to be taken as the operative date. However, where monies were concerned (such as CPF accounts and bank balances), it was accepted that the values taken would be the balances in these accounts as at the date of Interim Judgment. Nevertheless, where both counsel had agreed at the hearing to a particular value for a matrimonial asset, I adopted in my decision that agreed value. Save for such agreed values, I took for each matrimonial asset the available value as close as possible to the relevant operative date for that asset in question.

## Division of Matrimonial Assets

#### Pool of matrimonial assets

19     Based on the evidence before me, I found the following assets to be in the pool of (disclosed) matrimonial assets for division:

> (a)     Assets in the Wife’s sole name as shown below in Table A:

> The values of these assets set out above in Table B were values that were also agreed and accepted by both counsel during the hearings except that there were some issues with respect to the Husband’s car and insurance policy at items 7 and 8.

> For the car (item 8), it should be noted that the Wife’s counsel had subsequently accepted the Husband’s evidence tendered at the hearing (on 16 August 2019) that its current market value was about $11,264. As the outstanding loan for the car was accepted to be $7,689.50 (as of 28 August 2019) based on documents tendered at the hearing, the net value of the car was therefore taken to be $3,574.50.

> For the LIC insurance policy (item 7), the Husband argued that he had bought the policy 2 years before the marriage. But, as the Husband had continued to pay premiums over the course of the marriage, I held that it was acquired during the marriage and included its agreed value of $10,759 in the pool of matrimonial assets. In coming to this finding, I had regard to the High Court’s decision in _BUX v BUY_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHCF 4</span> at \[13\] where a similar issue arose and the High Court stated as follows: “_The value that the court adopts for insurance policies is the surrender value, which increases over time as premiums continue to be paid. It may be said that premium payments, rather than the mere act of purchase, constitute “acquisition” of insurance policies. Further, insurance policies may lapse if premiums are not paid when due. Since the Wife continued to pay premiums over the course of the marriage, I found that the Great Eastern policy was acquired during the marriage.”_ The High Court then went on in that case to include the policy’s full surrender value in the pool of matrimonial assets as it did not have evidence of the pre-marriage value of the policy or the date of its purchase.

> On the issue of liabilities (item 10), I accepted that the Husband had existing loans of $30,000 and that they were taken for the welfare of the family.

> (c)     Matrimonial Home registered in Husband’s sole name

> At the hearing, the agreed market value of the Matrimonial Home was $630,000 and the agreed outstanding housing loan for the Matrimonial Home as of March 2019 was $172,244.20. Therefore, the agreed net value of the Matrimonial Home was taken to be $457,755.80.

#### Alleged undisclosed assets belonging to the Wife

20     The Husband alleged that the Wife had not disclosed the following assets:

> (a)     Her personal jewellery;

> (b)     Gold jewellery which he had bought for her and the Children;

> (c)     Investments with APEX wealth management (“**APEX**”);

> (d)     Several properties belonging to her in India, and

> (e)     Her life insurance policy which was purchased in India.

21     On the Wife’s personal jewellery, the Husband alleged that the Wife had bought about $25,000 worth of jewellery for herself. Separately, he had also purchased (since their marriage) about another $25,000 worth of gold jewellery for her and the children mainly at Mustafa’s Departmental Store in Singapore (“Mustafa”). He alleged that she had hidden all the jewellery in a locker account in India. In support of his claim, he produced documents evidencing his credit card payments for purchases at Mustafa which were dated in 2012 and after 2012.The Husband did not tender any documents evidencing his purchase of jewellery for the period before 2012.

22     The Wife’s position was that the personal jewellery (in her possession) were given to her by her parents as gifts, and they were not purchased by her husband. The Wife stated that her family was reasonably well off. She explained that the chain that she was shown wearing in the photo exhibited by the Husband was given to her by her parents as a wedding gift (and it did not bear any Mustafa mark as alleged by the Husband). There were other jewellery gifted by her parents to her during her wedding but these other items of jewellery had been taken away by the Husband earlier. He had told her that it was family custom for the mother –in-law (his mother) to safeguard the daughter-in-law’s jewellery. The Wife admitted that she currently also wore another chain but that was also gifted to her by her mother when her daughter was born.

23     The Wife submitted that by 2012, her relationship with the Husband had deteriorated. I noted that this fact was admitted by the Husband. He had affirmed in his affidavit that parties had started living apart (in separate rooms) in 2012. The Wife explained that the Husband’s purchases at Mustafa (as evidenced by his credit card documents) were his purchases of jewellery in Singapore for his family members who had visited him. They had quarrelled over the fact that he had bought his family members gold but had not bothered to do so for her. As the burden of proof lay with the Husband, I was not satisfied that he had proved, on a balance of probabilities, that he had purchased $25,000 worth of jewellery for the Wife and Children since their marriage (in 2006), or that the jewellery in the Wife’s possession (given by her parents to her) should form part of the pool of matrimonial assets.

24     The existence of a locker facility maintained jointly by the Wife and her father was also not proof of the Husband’s claims that he had purchased gold jewellery to the tune of $25,000 for the Wife and children during the marriage. During the hearing, the Wife’s father filed an affidavit (in May 2019) explaining that he had opened the locker account in the joint names of himself and the Wife (his eldest daughter) long before her marriage to the Husband. He did it then as the Wife was his first daughter and he did not change it thereafter. The Wife also filed affidavits (in July 2018 and in July 2019) explaining that whilst there was a locker opened in her father’s name and her name earlier on, the locker was used by her father and she had nothing to do with the locker and she had not kept any of her possessions there.

25     The Wife also denied the Husband’s claims that she had investments with APEX. What he had exhibited were just flyers/brochures sent to the home. The Wife’s affidavits (in May and July 2019) contained correspondence from Professional Investment Advisory Services (PIAS) explaining that APEX was a branch of PIAS and confirming that she had only purchased one product via PIAS (specifically, an NTUC IncomeShield (policy no XX)) and that this product had no surrender value. I accepted the Wife’s evidence on this.

26     I turn now to the Husband’s allegation that the Wife had several properties in India with an aggregate value of about $600,000. In his AOM, the Husband claimed that the Wife had “2 houses worth $600,000 in India _by way of inheritance_”. Subsequently, in his second affidavit, he claimed that she had 3 Indian properties - “a flat and 2 independent houses worth $600,000 in India”. It should be noted that he did not identify the 3 properties prior to the start of the AM hearing in March 2019 save to state that the Wife’s father had brought him to one of the houses in 2006, and in 2013 the Wife’s father had brought him to ‘another site in Chennai’ where the Wife’s father was seeking money from the Wife to build a house. The Husband’s allegation that she had these several properties was also apparently premised on his reading of CIBIL (Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited) reports which he said showed that the Wife had taken up bank loans from 2011-2014. The Wife’s position was that she did not own any real properties in India and that she did not take up any loans as alleged. The said reports also did not show any such loans having been taken by her.

27     In the course of the hearings (in April and May 2019), the Husband then identified several Indian properties that he claimed were owned by the Wife solely and or jointly with her father. The Wife’s father then filed an affidavit (in May 2019) to disprove the Husband’s allegations on this issue. Property search reports, encumbrance certificates and title documents were also obtained for the same purpose, to disprove the Husband’s allegations. None of the properties in India as identified by the Husband were found to be registered in the name of the Wife. In summary, I found that the Husband’s allegations were not substantiated.

28     As regards the Wife’s non-disclosure of her life insurance policy that was purchased in India, the Wife explained in her affidavit (of 17 May 2019) that whilst she had bought one earlier in India, the policy had no value and it had lapsed for non-payment. The Wife agreed that she had made some payment initially but there had been “_no recurring payments thereafter as evinced from \[her\] HDFC account_”. However, she did not provide any supporting evidence from the Indian insurers to substantiate her statement. She also did not explain why she could not have done so.

#### Alleged undisclosed assets belonging to the Husband and other claims made by the Wife

29     The Wife made several allegations against the Husband. The details of these allegations were set out mainly in her second affidavit of 23 July 2018. Briefly, they were as follows:

> (a)     She alleged that after the breakdown of their marriage, the Husband had been dissipating monies from his bank accounts between 2012 and 2017 by (i) extending loans to family members and friends, and (ii) making (what she termed as) bulk cash withdrawals, without her consent and knowledge. It was the Wife’s case that all these had been done systematically by the Husband to thwart her lawful claim to a share of these monies as matrimonial assets. She had discovered this only through her applications for discovery and interrogatories. The Wife submitted that all the monies he had siphoned from his accounts should be added back into the pool of matrimonial assets for division.

> (b)     She alleged that he had failed to disclose his Maybank Account No. XX (“**Maybank Account**”) and invited the Court to draw an adverse inference against his refusal to disclose his Maybank statements.

> (c)     She showed supporting documents of the establishment of a company in India (“**Indian Company**”) where the directors and shareholders of the company were the Husband’s parents. The Indian Company was incorporated on 24 March 2016. The purported business carried on by the Indian Company was the provision of IT services, something which was within the domain knowledge and expertise of the Husband. As the Husband’s parents were in their 70s and 80s and by the Husband’s admission, sickly and frail, the Wife invited the court to lift the corporate veil and to hold that the Indian Company was in fact owned and controlled by the Husband and that the Husband’s parents were just a front for the Husband. She submitted that she should have a just and equitable share of the Indian Company.

> (d)     She claimed that she was entitled to a half share of the rental proceeds that he had earned from the subletting of a room in the Matrimonial Home during the marriage and she also sought the return of her jewellery (gifts to her by her parents during the wedding) that had been taken away by the Plaintiff and kept in his mother’s custody.

30     As regards the Maybank Account, I noted the Husband’s explanation in his affidavit of 17 August 2018 that he did not have any live account with Maybank and accepted his evidence of a letter dated 16 August 2018 from Maybank confirming that there was no transaction made in the Maybank Account which was opened in June 2015 and closed on July 2018.

31     As regards the Indian Company, the Husband had exhibited in his same affidavit (of 17 August 2018) a copy of his parents’ letter dated 16 August 2018 to the Family Court explaining why they had started the company in March 2016 and that since the start, they have not been able to concentrate on their company’s activities and that the company has had no returns. They gave proof of this by providing copies of their Indian income tax returns submitted for the company for assessment years 2016-2017 and 2017-2018. It was not disputed that the Husband’s parents had come to Singapore in July / August 2016 to stay with him and that they have been residing in the Matrimonial Home. Whilst the Wife was entitled to have her doubts as to the real ownership and control of the Indian Company given the advanced ages of the Husband’s parents and their background, she was not able to provide any evidence to support her claim. Mere suspicion on the part of the Wife alone, in the absence of any other supporting evidence, was not sufficient for me to hold that the Indian Company was controlled by and beneficially owned by the Husband. As such, I declined to draw any adverse inference against the Husband on account of the Wife’s allegations relating to the Indian Company.

32     As regards the alleged various ‘bulk cash withdrawals’ made by the Husband from his UOB and POSB accounts referred to in paragraph 29(a)(ii), having read the Husband’s explanation in his affidavits (of 17 August 2018 and 27 May 2019) for each of these withdrawals and having considered the supporting documents adduced by the Husband in relation to these withdrawals and the evidence of the Husband’s income and his expenditure (personal as well for the family and home), I was of the view that the Husband had adequately explained these cash withdrawals in that they were withdrawals of monies from his accounts for genuine transactions. Some were spent for the welfare and benefit of the family and some were for his own purposes such as the payment of legal fees incurred for his court proceedings. The Husband had also explained his practice of taking loans to repay existing loans. In this regard, he had adduced (in his affidavit of 27 May 2019) documentary evidence in the form of text exchanges between the parties in March 2014 (“**Text Messages**”) which showed the following: (a) that the Wife was asking him what had happened to the ‘house purchase’ and whether he was still intending to buy it and his response that he had not done so yet, but was intending to do so soon and so, he had no funds to give her; (b) that the Wife then wanted him to borrow some funds for her (as she was planning to buy a property in India if he was not going to do so) and the Husband’s response then was that he “_can’t go for any more loans_”, that he needed “_money to settle monthly instalments_”, and that he was “_borrowed to \[his\] limit and can’t stretch any more_”.

33     I now address the Wife’s allegations referred to in paragraph 29(a)(i) on the loans extended to family members and friends. The Wife had identified certain sums of monies that the Husband had sent to his father, his 2 brothers, his sister and brother in law and 5 friends during the period from 2012 to 2017 as loans that were made by the Husband without her consent or knowledge.

34     The Husband admitted in his affidavit of 17 August 2018 that some of the sums identified by the Wife were indeed loans. He had lent various sums to his 2 brothers, his brother-in-law and a few of his friends but the loans had all been repaid by them. I noted that most of these loans were for small amounts. For instance, whilst the Husband had admitted to lending a close friend $15,000, this was in fact an aggregated amount lent over a long period of about 5 years (between 2012 and 2017). As for his loans to his 2 brothers in India, these were in 2 sums in 2015 and 2017 and totalled about $14,000. There was documentary evidence adduced which proved that a part of these loans to one brother had been repaid into the Husband’s Indian bank account in 2017. The Husband explained that he had collected the rest in cash from his brothers and had used these monies during his overseas trip with the Children in India. As for the monies transferred to his sister in India (about $8,800), the monies were also given over a period of about 4 years (between 2013 and 2017). The Husband had explained that these monies were not loans but monies he had paid his sister for a variety of reasons such as for her assistance in paying his insurance and helping him with his rental accommodation and care arrangements for the Children whenever his family stayed in India.

35     As for the monies which the Wife had alleged were 3 tranches of loans that the Husband advanced to his father from 2013 to 2017, the Husband’s evidence was that these were not loans to his father.[^2]

> (a)     Firstly, according to the Husband, the monies under the alleged “first loan” and “second loan” were monies that came from his Wife and loans he had taken from several banks in Singapore for an intended property purchase in India. Briefly, his evidence on this was as follows:[^3]

>> (i)       In December 2012, his Wife had remitted $22,460 (INR 1,000,000) into his HDFC account.

>> (ii)       In January 2013, he had remitted 2 sums, $22,500 (INR 955,350) and $56,268 (INR 2,400,000) amounting to about 3.3 million INR into his HDFC account. These monies were from credit card loans obtained by him from a few Singapore banks.

>> (iii)       In January 2014, he had then transferred INR 900,000 to his father for payment of the Indian property. This was evidenced by the narrations in the bank statements which stated that the transfer of this sum was for “Property Deposit”. He had also paid one “NM” INR 100,000 (vide cheque) for the property purchase. Therefore, a total of about INR 1,000,000 was transferred from his HDFC account for the advance payment towards the property purchase in January 2014. He had used the Wife’s monies (INR 1,000,000) referred to in sub-paragraph (a)(i) above for such payment. However, he had stopped the property purchase later due to differences with his Wife, and as such, these monies that were paid were forfeited. However, he could no longer find the documents relating to the said property transaction.

>> (iv)       As for the credit card loans from the Singapore banks that he had taken under his name, his elder brother (who was planning to repatriate back to India from Singapore at the time) helped him with the repayment of these loans. In September 2015, using the funds referred to in sub-paragraph (a)(ii) above in his HDFC account, he had transferred INR 4,800,000 to his father’s account.

> (b)     As for the monies alleged by the Wife to be the “third loan” to his father during the period from August 2014 to June 2017 (about $17,000), his evidence was that the narrations for these various transfers in the bank statements showed that the monies were withdrawn to pay for his rental accommodation in India and to settle debts, maintenance and family expenses.

36     I noted that the Text Messages between the parties in March 2014 did reveal that the Wife was aware of an intended “house purchase” at the time and was agreeable to her funds being used for it. However, there was no documentary evidence adduced on the alleged property transaction and when it was aborted and the forfeiture of the payments made. On the available evidence before me, I took into account the Wife’s monies ($22,460) as part of her indirect financial contributions (see paragraph 35(a)(iii)).

37     As for the monies referred to in paragraph 35(a)(ii), whilst the Husband did show that the loan monies $22,500 (for the first transfer of INR 955,350) from his OCBC account were derived from a loan given by ANZ Bank, he did not produce any documentary evidence showing that the second transfer of $56,268 came from the other alleged credit card loans obtained by him. Although again, the Text Messages in March 2014 did support his position that he had taken on many loans at that time and was not in a position to borrow more from the banks.

38     The Husband's father wrote a note about the sums he had received in September 2015 from his son to settle loans and that he had immediately transferred the funds to the other party. He also showed his September 2015 bank statements as proof that the amounts (INR 4,800,000) sent to his account had been paid out in full shortly within the same month.[^4] However, there was no affidavit filed by the Husband’s father with documentary evidence to substantiate with details where these monies went to and for settlement of what loans even though he said he was a witness to these transactions. Based on the Husband’s position referred to in paragraph 35(a)(iv), these sums should have been used to repay the Husband’s elder brother who had earlier helped the Husband to repay (in full or part) his credit loans from the Singapore banks. However, this was not mentioned in the written note submitted by the Husband’s father and the note merely stated that the monies which went into the Husband’s father’s bank account were taken out immediately for the payments to the other party. All considered, there were significant gaps in the Husband’s explanation relating to the sums referred to in paragraph 35(a)(ii) and its eventual utilisation which the Husband was not able to properly account for.

39     As the Matrimonial Home was in the Husband’s sole name, I rejected the Wife’s claim referred to in paragraph 29(d) that she was entitled to a half share of the rental proceeds that he had earned from the subletting of a room in the Matrimonial Home during the marriage. I also did not entertain the Wife’s claim for the return of her jewellery (that was gifted by her parents to her) as there was no evidence before me as to what these items of jewellery were or their values.

#### Structured approach in ANJ v ANK

40     For the division of matrimonial assets, both parties in their submissions adopted the structured approach set out in the Court of Appeal case of _ANJ v ANK_ (2015) SGCA 34 (“**_ANJ v ANK_**”). I accepted that the structured approach in _ANJ v ANK_ was applicable as this was a dual -income marriage. The approach has been summarised by the High Court in _TIT v TIU_ (2016) 3 SLR 1137 at \[21\] as follows:

> _“(a_)     _express as a ratio the parties’ direct contributions relative to each other, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets;_

> (_b_)     _express as a second ratio the parties’ indirect contributions relative to each other, having regard to both indirect financial and non-financial contributions; and_

> (_c_)     _derive the parties’ overall contributions to each other by taking an average of the two ratios above (the derived ratio shall be referred to as “the average ratio”), keeping in mind that, depending on the circumstances of each case, the direct and indirect contributions may not be accorded equal weight and one of the two ratios may be accorded more significance than the other. Adjustments could also be made in respect of other relevant factors under s 112 or s 114(1) of the Women’s Charter…”_

41     In relation to the above structured approach, I was also mindful of the Court of Appeal’s comments in _ANJ v ANK_ at \[24\] and \[25\] that the approach was not intended to operate as a rigid mathematical formula and that the broad-brush approach was in no way replaced by it:

> _“24_      _In relation to indirect contributions, the problem with ascertaining the extent of the parties’ contributions with precision is further compounded… Contributions in the form of parenting, homemaking and husbandry, by their very nature, are incapable of being reduced into monetary terms. No mathematical formula or analytical tool is capable of capturing or accommodating the diverse and myriad set of factual scenarios that may present themselves to court as to how the parties may have chosen to divide among themselves duties and responsibilities in the domestic sphere. It is in making this determination that what is known as the broad brush approach would have to come into play. What values to give to the indirect contributions of the parties is necessarily a matter of impression and judgment of the court. In most homes, even in a home where both spouses are working full time, in the absence of concrete evidence, it is more likely than not that ordinarily the wife will be the party who renders greater indirect contributions. That said, even in a home where the wife is a full time homemaker, it would be an exceptional home where the husband renders no indirect contribution at all. What values to attribute to each spouse in relation to indirect contributions would be a matter of assessment for the court and in that regard, broad strokes would have to be the order of the day. In seeking to arrive at a ratio that represents both parties’ comparative indirect contribution towards the family, the court must, in the final analysis, exercise sound discretion along with a keen emphasis on all the relevant facts of each case._

> _25_      _We would reiterate that while we seek to bring in some system into the question of determining how the matrimonial assets of a marriage are to be divided, we do not pretend to be scientific. The broad brush is in no way replaced as we recognise all too clearly in any marriage many things are done unrecorded – out of love, concern and responsibility – and not with a view to building up a case in the event the marriage fails…”_

#### Direct contributions

42     I set out below, in Table C, my determination of the parties’ respective direct financial contributions to the pool of matrimonial assets. The Husband’s direct contributions towards the acquisition of the Matrimonial Home amounted to about $252,001. I did not accept the Wife’s claim that she had made any direct contributions towards the purchase or improvement of the Matrimonial home. My reasons are set out in paragraphs 41 and 42. As for the other assets in the matrimonial pool, I took a broad brush approach and used their agreed or determined values (as set out in paragraph 19 above) as reflecting the parties’ respective direct financial contributions.

43     Based on the figures set out in Table C, the ratio of direct contributions was 73.77% (Husband): 26.23% (Wife). From the Court’s records, I noted that I had wrongly deducted the sum of $30,000 (as part of Husband’s liabilities) from the Husband’s total direct contributions of $429,121.28. The liability of $30,000 should only have been deducted for the purpose of determining the net value of the pool of matrimonial assets and not the Husband’s direct contributions. The wrongful deduction resulted in a reduced sum of $399,121.28 attributed to the Husband’s direct contributions. This affected the percentages of direct contributions of the parties determined (using the lower figure), with the percentages so derived as 72.35(Husband): 27.65(Wife). However, this computational error was not significant as compared to the correct direct contribution percentages of 73.77 (Husband): 26.23 and did not affect the final overall average ratio (as set out in paragraph 51 below) that I had determined to be a fair and equitable division of the pool of matrimonial assets of the parties.

44     On the issue of direct contributions towards the acquisition or improvement of the Matrimonial Home, the Wife claimed that the Husband had been given in 2 sums, the total amount of $47,000 for the purchase of the Matrimonial Home. This was denied by the Husband. I did not accept the Wife’s evidence on this for the following reasons. Firstly, at the outset in her AOM, the Wife had stated that she did _not_ make any direct financial contributions towards the acquisition or improvement of the Matrimonial Home. Her claim of having contributed $47,000 was only set out for the first time in her second affidavit of 23 July 2018 filed about one year later. In it, she now alleged that: (a) her parents had given her in Indian currency (about $30,000) in June 2007 when the Husband came to India and she in turn had given the monies to him and he had spent it later on furnishings for the home, and (b) when they got married in 2006, her parents also gave the Husband a cash gift in Indian currency (about $17,000) as the Husband had said then that he wanted to buy a flat. It was difficult to see how she could have omitted all these important matters in her AOM as the amounts (of $30,000 and $17,000) were not insignificant.

45     Secondly, there was also no objective documentary evidence adduced by the Wife on the withdrawals or movements of these alleged sums at the material time. It should be noted that whilst the Wife’s father had also filed an affidavit (in May 2019) during the hearing to explain these sums allegedly given by him, he did not adduce any documentary evidence to show his withdrawals or movements of these monies (in Indian currency) at the relevant times in 2006 and 2007. Further, his version of what happened in 2007 was also inconsistent with that of his daughter’s. He had alleged that he had given the second sum in Indian currency (about $30,000) to the Husband and not to the Wife (as was alleged by the Wife) and that it was given for the down payment of the flat for the family. Given the above contradictions and inconsistencies and the lack of any supporting documentary evidence, I did not accept the Wife’s claim that she had made direct financial contributions of $47,000 towards the purchase or improvement of the Matrimonial Home.

#### Indirect Contributions

46     For the parties’ indirect contributions to the marriage and the welfare of the family, the Husband submitted that this should be apportioned between the parties in the ratio of 60 (Husband):40(Wife). On the other hand, the Wife submitted that the apportionment should be in the ratio of 40 (Husband):60 (Wife). Based on the parties’ respective submissions, it would appear that both parties acknowledged the indirect contributions of the other party although quite naturally, each party felt that he or she had contributed slightly more than the other party.

47     I noted that for the first 4 plus years of their marriage (from May 2006 to September 2010), the Husband was the sole provider and the Wife was the homemaker and primary caregiver for the son (who was born in early 2007). However, it should also be noted that during the period from December 2006 to February 2008, the Wife was actually residing in India with her parents for the delivery of the son and she looked after the son in India until he was about 1 year old before she returned to Singapore with him. Whilst she was in India during this period, her expenses and the child’s expenses (including delivery expenses) were taken care of by her parents. And thereafter, upon her return in February 2008 and until September 2010 (when she started full-time employment), the Wife was looking after the household and the son whilst the Husband was working and studying.

48     In his AOM, the Husband acknowledged that as the family expenses were high, the parties had decided then (in 2010) that the Wife should find a job to help support the family. As she was going to be working full-time, a maid was thus employed in September 2010 to help parties look after the home and child. Notwithstanding, the Wife did not have an easy time juggling her 2 roles at home and at work. When her second child (the daughter) was born in March 2012, the Wife continued with her employment and her parents came over for most of 2012 to help her with the baby as the maid could not cope. By 2012, both parties agreed that their relationship had become strained. But, they continued to live in the same house. I noted that whilst the Husband had paid for all the outgoings of their home, its furnishings, the car expenses and for their first maid (from September 2010 to May 2013), the Wife also did her part. After she started working, she did contribute towards the groceries for the family, the expenses of their subsequent 3 maids (salary, hiring expenses and levy) for the period from June 2013 until May 2016 and the children’s expenses.

49     Further, during the period from December 2012 to February 2014, the Wife had also transferred monies from her account into the Husband’s account (as evidenced by the bank documents produced).[^5] The Wife stated that these transfers were made upon the Husband’s request. The transfers alone amounted to almost $50,000 during this period and included monies which were requested for the repayment of loans he had taken and contributions towards a property purchase in India and the down payment of their first car. The Husband did not deny the receipt of these funds and certain cash withdrawals that were given to him. All these amounted in total to about $57,700.

50     When the marriage soured, the parties nevertheless continued to live in the same home and since 2016, they have each also been trying to carry out their responsibilities as joint care-parents for the Children pursuant to the interim custody orders that were granted by consent. Based on the evidence before me, both parties were working full-time and working hard to bring up their Children. And, since 2016 until the hearing of the ancillary matters in 2019, interim maintenance orders were also obtained setting out how they were to share in the maintenance of the Children and the common household expenses including the maid’s expenses. In the circumstances of this case, having considered all the evidence and on a broad brush approach, I found it fair and just to attribute to the parties (in respect of their indirect (financial and non-financial) contributions to the family, an equal ratio of 50:50.

#### Final Ratio

51     Based on the average of the proportions determined for both the direct and indirect contributions, I then arrived at the overall average of 61.88 (Husband): 38.11 (Wife). Whilst the Wife had not adequately accounted for the value of her life insurance policy in India, the Husband had also not given an adequate accounting of all the monies that he had transferred from his Indian account to his father’s Indian account as highlighted earlier (see paragraphs 35 to 38). Having regard to this and taking a broad brush approach on the particular facts of this case, I made the final adjustments shown in Table D. I was of the view that the final adjusted ratio of 58(Husband):42(Wife) (set out in Table D) represented a just and equitable division of the parties’ pool of matrimonial assets.

## Apportionment

52     As the net value of the Matrimonial Home ($457,755.80) was more than half of the total (net) pool of matrimonial assets, I had checked with counsel whether any of the parties would like to keep the Matrimonial Home instead of having it sold in the open market. Counsel for the Husband confirmed that the Husband would like to keep the Matrimonial Home.

53     For the purpose of carrying out the division of the Matrimonial Home, both counsel confirmed at the hearing (on 16 August 2019) that parties would agree to $630,000 as the agreed market value of the Matrimonial Home. The net value of the Matrimonial Home was therefore taken to be $457,755.80 (that is $630,000 less outstanding mortgage loan of $172,244.20). As the Wife was entitled to 42% of the net value of the Matrimonial Home, the Wife would be entitled to receive the sum of $192,257.43 from the Husband if the Husband were to keep the Matrimonial Home.

54     For the other matrimonial assets (excluding the Matrimonial Home), the total pool was $299,677.38 (with $147,119.52 under the Husband’s sole name and $152,557.86 under the Wife’s sole name). The Husband’s 58% share for this pool of assets would translate to a sum of $173,812.88 and the Wife’s 43% share would translate to a sum $125,864.49. As the assets under the Husband’s sole name was $147,119.52, there would be an amount of $26,693.36 due from the Wife to the Husband (that is, the difference between $173,812.88 and $147,119.52).

55     Netting off the sum of $192,257.43 payable by the Husband to the Wife against the sum of $26,693.36 payable by the Wife to the Husband, there was a net sum of $165,564.07 payable by the Husband to the Wife. Of the sum of S$165,564.07, I then ordered that a sum of $120,000 shall be by way of transfer of CPF monies in the Husband’s CPF account(s) to the Wife’s CPF account(s) and the balance $45,564.07 shall be paid in cash by the Husband to the Wife.

56     The computation as set out in paragraphs 53 to 55 was confirmed by both counsel and the following orders were made in relation to the division of the matrimonial assets of the parties:

> “**_Division of Matrimonial Home_**

> _1_.     _The pool of matrimonial assets shall be divided in the ratio of 58(Plaintiff): 42 (Defendant) and this shall be effected as follows:_

> _5_.     _The parties, including the CPF Board, shall be at liberty to apply for further directions or orders generally.”_

## Custody, care and control of the Children

57     As was mentioned above, the parties had agreed to shared care and control of the Children pending the ancillaries. On this issue of the custody, care and control of the Children, I had ordered a custody evaluation report. After hearing the Wife on 30 August 2019 on the Husband’s detailed proposal for shared care and control and taking into consideration the report and the parties’ affidavits and submissions, I ordered the parties to have shared care and control of the Children on the terms as set out in Order 8. In my view, that was in the best interests of the Children on the particular facts of this case. At the hearing, the Wife had indicated to the Court that she was agreeable to the alternating week arrangements for the son, but would prefer to let the Husband have the daughter only for 2 nights (after school on Friday until Sunday morning). I was of the view that the Husband together with his parents and helper were well-equipped to take care of the daughter and he had been having shared care and control of the daughter since 2016.There was a loving and close relationship between the father and daughter, and it was in the child’s welfare for that to continue. I heard the Wife on her concerns and took them into consideration before making the orders set out in Orders 8(a) to 8(j). The effective date of 1 December 2019 stated in Order 8 was clarified on 3 September 2019 with both counsel and agreed. The date of 1 December 2019 was a date requested by the Wife’s counsel.

58     For ease of reference, I set out below Order 8 in its entirety:

> _“8_.     _The parties shall continue to have shared care and control of the Children and with effect from 1 December 2019, the Children shall reside with the Plaintiff and the Defendant in their respective homes in accordance with the terms set out below:_

>> (_a_)     **_During School Term_**

>> _The Children shall reside with the Defendant during the even weeks of the year._

>> _The Children shall reside with the Plaintiff during the odd weeks of the year._

>> (_b_)     **_Term Breaks and School Holidays (based on MOE calendar)_**

>> _The Children shall reside with the Defendant during the March school term break and during the Nov/December school holidays_

>> _The Children shall reside with the Plaintiff during the September school term break and during the June school holidays._

>> (_c_)     **_Birthdays and Hindu Festivals_**

>> _During odd years, the Plaintiff shall have the Children on their birthdays and during Hindu Festivals._

>> _During even years, the Defendant shall have the Children on their birthdays and during Hindu Festivals_.

>> (_d_)     _Whenever either parent should be away from Singapore for 5 consecutive days (or more)\[“the Period”\] during his/her respective care period, then that parent shall inform the other parent of this in advance, and parties shall make arrangements for the Children to be placed under the care of the other parent for the duration of the Period. In the event that the other parent is not in a position to have care of the Children, the party responsible for the care of the Children shall be at liberty to arrange such alternative care arrangements for the Children as may be mutually agreed by both parties._

>> (_e_)     _The parties shall communicate directly via Whatsapp and/or SMS and/email for all issues related to the or concerning the Children. The contact particulars and email addresses of the parties are set out below:_

>> _\[redacted\]_

>> _\[redacted\]_

>> (_f_)     _(i) Either party shall be at liberty to take the Children out of Singapore on the party’s allocated care period except that the Children shall not be brought overseas during the months of May and October until their school exams are over. During any overseas trip with the Children, the travelling parent shall let the children have access to the other parent through Skype, Whatsapp, video chats or any other means of communication._

>>> (_ii_)    _The party intending to travel shall provide all the following information to the other party by email (to that party’s email address as set out in this order) at least 5 days prior to the intended travel date:_

>>>> _\-_      _Destination(s)_

>>>> _\-_      _Dates of travel_

>>>> _\-_      _Places of stay_

>>>> _\-_      _Means of communication (with the travelling parent as well as the Children)_

>>> (_iii_)    _In the event of emergencies such as a funeral or hospitalisation of family members, the Children may be taken to India at short notice, provided that information referred to in subparagraph f(ii) above and information on the nature of the emergency is communicated by SMS or Whatsapp or email to the other party. The other party shall not withhold consent or the Children’s passports during such emergencies._

>> (_g_)     _The Plaintiff shall keep the daughter’s passport, birth certificates, bank passbooks, travel relate documents and any other important documents whilst the Defendant shall keep the son’s. If either party wishes to take any of these documents held by the other party, he/she shall inform the other party of his/her purpose and when the documents will be returned to the other party. Unless there are good reasons for withholding the documents, each party will give to the other party the required documents within 2 days of the request, and any document so taken by a party must be returned promptly to the other party for his/her safekeeping once the purpose for which the documents was required is fulfilled._

>> (_h_)     _The parties shall cooperate and take all steps reasonable and necessary to maintain and facilitate the Children’s PR status. At all times, both parties shall act in accordance with ICA’s regulations and instructions with respect to the Children’s PR status_

>> (_i_)     _The Children shall live and study in Singapore unless otherwise agreed in writing by both parties or varied by an order of court._

>> (_j_)     _Temporary changes to the shared care and control arrangements set out in this order may be made by mutual agreement of the parties.”_

#### Appeal by Husband against Order 8(b)

59     In effecting the shared care and control of the Children, the parties did not appeal against Order 8(a) which provided that during school term, the Children were to reside with each parent on an alternate week basis. Parties also did not appeal against Order 8(c) which provided that each parent was entitled to celebrate with the Children their birthdays and Hindu festivals on an alternate year basis.

60     However, the Husband had appealed against Order 8(b) which essentially gave each parent almost equal holiday time with their Children each year. Under Order 8(b), the Husband was to have the Children during the June school holidays and the September term break, whilst the Wife was to have the Children during the March term break and the December school holidays. The Wife did not appeal against Order 8(b). The terms of Order 8(b) were reasonable. Order 8(j) provided that parties were at liberty to make temporary changes to these arrangements by mutual agreement.

#### Appeal by Husband and Wife against Order 8(d)

61     Given the shared care arrangements set out in Orders 8(a) and (b), it was necessary to provide for the contingency when either parent had to be away from Singapore for 5 or more consecutive days during the periods when the Children were to be under their care. In this regard, Order 8(d) required the care-parent who was going overseas to inform the other parent of his or her travelling arrangements. Where possible, the other parent was to assist to take care of the Children during the period when the care-parent was away. But, if he or she was unable to do so, then the care-parent was to arrange for alternative care arrangements for the Children. Order 8(d) was made with the Children’s welfare and safety in mind. Further, given the parties’ shared care and control of the Children, it was also not unreasonable to provide for the arrangements in Order 8(d) so that both parents could co-operate and help each other for the welfare and safety of their Children.

#### Appeal by Husband against Order 8(f)

62     Under Order 8(f), each parent was entitled to take the Children out of Singapore during his or her allocated care periods subject to certain exceptions and conditions. The Husband had (in his counsel’s letter of 30 August 2019) argued that the notice period for giving the travel details to the other parent for any overseas trip with the Children should remain with the current 1-day notice. In my view, a minimum of 5 days’ notice is a more reasonable period than the current 1-day notice for any intended overseas trip with the Children.

#### Appeal by Husband and Wife against Order 8(g)

63     Order 8(g) dealt with the keeping of the Children’s passports and other important documents (“**Documents**”). After hearing both counsel on 30 August 2019, it was ordered that the Husband would keep the daughter’s Documents whilst the Wife would keep the son’s Documents. This was intended as a form of check and balance. As both parents were at liberty to travel with the Children during their allocated school term breaks and school holidays (as set out in Order 8(b)), there should be no concerns over their respective rights to obtain possession of the Children’s passports for this purpose.

## Maintenance of Children

64     As mentioned above, the orders relating to the maintenance of the Children were set out in Orders 9 to 15. Both Husband and Wife had only appealed against Order 11. There was no appeal against the other orders relating to the maintenance of the Children. As the other orders made in relation to the maintenance of the Children could have a bearing on Order 11, I have reproduced Orders 9 to 15 below:

> _“9_.     _The parties shall continue to comply with the maintenance orders for the Children as contained in the Order of Court dated 8 February 2018 until the end of November 2019._

> _10_.     _With effect from 30 August 2019 and until the end of 2019, each party shall be directly responsible for the payment of any tuition, enrichment classes or activities that he/she may have enrolled his child/children for during this period._

> _11_.     _With effect from 1 January 2020, the parties shall bear the following expenses of the Children in the ratio of 60 (Plaintiff Husband): 40 (Defendant Wife):_

>> (_a_)     _The Children’s school fees_

>> (_b_)     _The Children’s school transport expenses_

>> (_c_)     _The expenses for any school activity / class / trip which the Children are required by their schools to attend, or which the parties have agreed to permit their Children to participate or enrol in._

>> (_d_)     _The Children’s year – end school related expenses_

>> (_e_)     _The Children’s dental expenses_

>> (_f_)     _The Children’s medical expenses (including hospitalisation expenses) that are not covered by any insurance_

> _The Plaintiff Husband shall be responsible for the payment of items set out in subparagraphs (a) and (b). The Defendant Wife shall be responsible for the payment of items set out in subparagraphs (c) and (d) and (e). For the items set out in subparagraph (f), the payment will be handled by the parent in whose care the child is in when these medical or hospitalisation services are required. Reimbursements by one party to the other shall be made against production of the relevant receipts._

> _12_.     _The Plaintiff and the Defendant shall discuss and mutually agree on the tuition, enrichment classes or activities (collectively, “Classes and Activities”) that they wish to enrol their Children in with effect from 1 January 2020 and the parties shall be responsible for the payment of all such agreed Classes and Activities in the ratio of 60 (Plaintiff Husband):40 (Defendant Wife) with effect from 1 January 2020. The Plaintiff Husband shall be responsible for the payment of all the agreed Classes and Activities for the daughter whilst the Wife shall be responsible for the payment of all the agreed Classes and Activities for the son and each party shall reimburse the other party for his/her share of the relevant fees upon production of receipts._

> _13_.     _The Plaintiff shall continue to be solely responsible for the payment of the existing insurances that he has taken out for the Children._

> _14_.     _Save as set out in paragraphs 11 to 13 above, the parties shall be responsible for all other living expenses incurred by the Children when the Children are in their respective care and control. For the avoidance of doubt, when a parent decides to bring any child for an overseas trip, that parent shall be solely responsible for that child’ travel expenses._

> _15_.     _All reimbursements made against production of receipts shall be effected within 30 days into the other party’s designated account (as shown below):_

> _Plaintiff’s designated bank account \[redacted\]_

> _Defendant’s designated bank account \[redacted\]”_

65     Under Order 11, I had ordered that the expenses listed therein were to be shared by the parties in the ratio of 60(Husband):40(Wife). Other than the sharing of these listed expenses, each party was to be responsible for all the other expenses of the Children incurred while the Children were residing with each of them during their allocated care periods. In arriving at this sharing ratio, I took into consideration the financial capabilities of the parents. Based on the AOM, the Husband had a net monthly salary of $5,791 and he was also receiving rental income of about $750 per month, whereas the Wife had a net monthly salary of $4,190. Hence, the Husband’s income (of about $6,541) was about 60% of the parties’ combined income (of about $10,731). In addition, I noted that the sharing ratio is more or less in line with the Wife’s proposal for a sharing ratio of 65(Husband):35(Wife). In his proposal to the Court on 24 August 2019, the Husband had also submitted he was willing to share school fees on 60:40 basis. Further, his counsel had also informed the court that he was willing to be solely responsible for the maintenance of the Children if he had sole care and control of them. It should also be noted that there was no appeal by both Husband and Wife against Order 12, where the same sharing ratio of 60:40 was applied to the expenses incurred for the agreed classes and activities referred to therein.

66     The reimbursement and sharing ratio approach was adopted as the amount of payments for the items set out in Order 11 could vary through the years. The same reimbursement method was also adopted in Order 12 and as mentioned earlier, there was no appeal by both parties against Order 12.

## Agreed Sum under the Interim Order

67     Both parties had appealed against Order 16. The Agreed Sum of $4,643.20 was the net amount payable by the Wife to the Husband under the Interim Order for the period February 2018 to July 2019. The Agreed Sum was agreed by both the Husband and the Wife when they appeared before me together with their respective counsel on 30 August 2019. The court’s records stated that although the Agreed Sum of $4,643.20 as proposed by the Husband was agreed to by the Wife and her counsel, it was stated to be subject to certain exceptions / exclusions relating to a few items: tuition receipts for the son’s enrichment classes, pocket money for the son and the maid’s salary and levy payable for the month of June 2019. However, the terms of Order 16 (as agreed by both counsel) did not provide for these exceptions / exclusions. Both counsel were to handle the further accounting for these few items for their clients after checks were done and upon production of the relevant documentary evidence. As the aggregate amount for these few items should not be substantial, if there should be any adjustments on the final figures, the parties should be able to agree on the amount that the Wife is to be reimbursed as this issue was clearly discussed during the hearing on 30 August 2019 and recorded in the notes of evidence.

68     Finally, I granted counsel’s request for time for the Wife to pay the Agreed Sum. Based on the evidence and considering the assets in the Wife’s sole name and those assets (including the cash) that she would be entitled to receive under Order 1, the Wife should be able to pay the Agreed Sum over the 5 instalments that I had ordered under Order 16.
