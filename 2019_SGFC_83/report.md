Family Law – Maintenance for children

2 August 2019

### District Judge Christine Lee:

### Introduction

1       The Father has filed an appeal in DCA 48 of 2019 against those parts of the Court’s decision in the Court Order dated 18 April 2019 regarding the additional payments by the Father for the three children of the marriage.

### Background Facts

2       The Plaintiff Mother (“the Mother”) and Defendant Father (“the Father”) married on XXX in Singapore. There are three (3) children from the marriage namely, xxx (f) DOB xxx now aged 14 years; xxx (f) DOB xxx now aged 11 years and xxx (f) DOB xxx now aged 7 years (“the said 3 children”). The marriage lasted about 14 years before the Mother filed Writ of Divorce on 11 December 2017.

3       On 10 January 2018, Interim Judgement (IJ) was granted based on the fact that the Mother had sufficiently proven the contents of the Statement of Claim and the marriage was dissolved by reason that the Father had behaved in such a way that the Mother could not reasonably be expected to live with the Father.

4       The IJ also contained a Consent Order (“the 10 January 2018 Consent Order”) dealing with all the Ancillary Matters between the Parties. As such, Certificate of Final Judgement was issued on 12 April 2018.

### Hearings before the Court

5       Both Parties subsequently filed applications to vary Clauses 3(a) (b) and (f) of the 10 January 2018 Consent Order.

6       There were 3 summons applications as follows:

> (i)     SUM xxx/2018 filed on 26 June 2018 by the Father for a variation of Clause 3(b) for specified and expanded access to the said 3 children and for additional clauses regarding their upbringing;

> (ii)     SUM xxx/2018 filed on 24 December 2018 by the Mother also for variation of Clause 3(b) regarding the Father’s specified access and for variation of Clause 3(f) for the Father to pay for the said 3 children’s enrichment classes and their medical expenses that required prepayment of the sum of $500 and above; and

> (iii)     SUM xxx/2019 filed on 17 January 2019 by the Father for variation of Clause 3(a) for specified joint custody rights.

7       The Court dealt with the 3 summons applications on two hearing days namely, 26 March 2019 and 18 April 2019 whereupon the Court delivered its decision.

8       The Father filed Notice of Appeal on 2 May 2019 in HCF/DCA 48/2019 against one paragraph with three corresponding sub-paragraphs of the Court Order issued on 18 April 2019 (“the said Court Order”) regarding payment for the said 3 children’s specified enrichment classes.

9       The Mother also filed Notice of Appeal on 2 May 2019 in HCF/DCA 49/2019 against one paragraph with the corresponding sub-paragraphs of the said Court Order, on the Father’s access to the said 3 children, specifically those provisions which allowed the Father to take the youngest daughter out of jurisdiction during his access. However, the Mother subsequently filed Notice of Withdrawal of Appeal on 26 July 2019.

### The Appeal

10     The Father is appealing against paragraph 4(b) of the said Court Order which provisions are set out below.

> **Paragraph 4(b) of the said Court Order**

> 4.    Clause 3(f) of the Order of Court dated 10 January 2018 is varied as set out below:

>> b)    The \[Father\] shall further also pay for the said 3 children’s extracurricular activities and tuition/enrichment classes within 14 days of the production of receipts for such expenses. To avoid all doubt, this refers to the following extracurricular activities and tuition/enrichment classes:

>>> i.    For xxx: (i) Dyslexia Association of Singapore (DAS) fees and School Choir expenses;

>>> ii.    For xxx: (i) Oak Tree Enrichment Centre Maths Tuition (ii) Ballet class fees including examination fees and (iii) Gymnastics fees. For all incidentals related to the gymnastics and ballet classes, the \[Father\]’s prior consent is required, which shall not be unreasonably withheld;

>>> iii.   For xxx: Anticipated Oak Tree Enrichment Centre Maths and English Tuition. For all her other extracurricular activities and tuition/enrichment classes, the \[Father\]’s prior consent is required, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Provided that the \[Father\] shall pay the Oak Tree Enrichment Centre directly for any outstanding fees due for 2018 within fourteen (14) days’ notice thereof from the said Centre.

### Submissions before the Court

11     Before making its decision on the Mother’s application for the Father to make the requested additional payments, the Court noted that at the time of the 10 January 2018 Consent Order, the Parties had agreed that the Father was to pay the sum of $4,000 for the monthly maintenance of the said 3 children.

12     However, the Court also noted that in the same Order at Clause 3(f)(ii)(a) and (d), the Parties had also agreed: “_In addition, the \[Father\] shall pay for (a) medical/hospitalization/dental bills and (d) enrichment classes_, **_subject to parties’ discussion and agreement_**” \[emphasis added\].

13     Thus, at the first hearing on 26 March 2019, the Court took the view that under this Clause, the Father should continue to be liable for current enrichment classes but that his agreement was required for new enrichment classes, which agreement should not be unreasonably withheld. The Court therefore sought both Counsel’s assistance on the current payments being made by the Father with regard to the said 3 children’s enrichment classes.

14     The Court was informed by the Father’s Counsel that the Father was currently paying for the shoes for xxx’s choir performances, xxx’s ballet and gymnastics classes and books and uniforms for the said 3 children. The Court was further informed by the Father’s Counsel that the Father was also paying for the said 3 children’s medical insurance as well as their medical expenses as ordered under the 10 January 2018 Consent Order.

15     The Court was informed by the Mother’s Counsel that the Father had been paying for xxx’s (the eldest child) term fees at the Dyslexia Association of Singapore (DAS) but did not agree to re-enrol her as she was now doing well. The Mother’s Counsel also informed that xxx (the middle child) had been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and that Maths tuition at the Oak Tree Enrichment Centre was necessary for her continued educational needs. For xxx (the youngest child), the Mother’s Counsel submitted that it was the Father who had originally taken xxx out of kindergarten and enrolled her at the Oak Tree Enrichment Centre for Maths and English tuition.

16     It was further submitted by the Mother’s Counsel that the Father now did not agree to pay for any tuition regarding xxx and xxx at the Oak Tree Enrichment Centre. The Court was also informed by the Mother’s Counsel that the Mother wanted the Father to pay for all incidentals connected to the said 3 children’s ballet, choir and gymnastics activities.

17     In reply, the Father’s Counsel submitted that as xxx was doing well, there was no need for xxx to continue at the DAS. The Father also did not believe in continued tuition for xxx as he could assist her with her Maths. Finally, the Father had enrolled xxx at the Oak Tree Enrichment Centre because it was the transition period before xxx commenced Primary 1 and was of the view that XXX no longer required such tuition.

18     In response to the Court’s query as to whether the Mother’s requests for such additional payments should be brought under an enforcement application, the Mother’s Counsel submitted that as the Parties could not come to any agreement, it was necessary to specify the additional payments which the Father should make for clarity of the Father’s obligations should enforcement be required.

19     The Mother also wanted to specify that the Father was to make payment for the said 3 children’s medical expenses that required prepayment of the sum of $500 and above.

### Summary of the Court’s reasons for making its Order

20     The Court noted that the Mother’s application under SUM xxx/2018 in relation to the Father’s appeal, was for the following additional payments by the Father:

> _All costs for extracurricular activities and enrichment classes for the children to be borne entirely by the \[Father\], including test/exam fees, performance and costume expense, etc. and that the \[Father\] does not unreasonably disagree to the children taking such classes and or activities._

21     The Court agreed with the Father’s Counsel that the Father’s agreement to pay for the said 3 children’s enrichment classes under the 10 January 2018 Consent Order, should not be considered to be a blank cheque for the Mother’s use.

22     However, as the Court was informed that the Parties could not come to agreement regarding the Father’s payment for the said 3 children’s enrichment classes, the Court was of the view that to avoid continued acrimony between the Parties and to minimise the possible adverse and destabilising effect of such acrimony on the said 3 children, that specification of what the Father should pay regarding the said 3 children’s enrichment classes, was necessary.

23     In relation to xxx (the eldest child), as the child was dyslexic, the Court was of the view that the child’s continued enrolment at the DAS was necessary for her educational and personal well-being. The Court was also of the view that the Father should continue to be liable for xxx’s school choir expenses for the same reason and noted that such expenses were not of large amounts and that the Father was already paying for xxx’s school choir expenses.

24     In relation to xxx (the middle child), the Court noted that the said child had special needs, having been diagnosed with ADHD which was not disputed by the Father. The Court was of the view that it was reasonable and necessary for the child’s educational well-being for her to continue to receive Maths tuition at the Oak Tree Enrichment Centre, which had been proven to have been good for her.

25     The Court was also of the view that the Father should continue to make payment for xxx’s Ballet class fees including examination fees and Gymnastics fees as these were also necessary for the child’s continued well-being as she appeared to be doing well and enjoying such classes. The Court noted that the Father was also already making such payments. However, the Court did not agree with the Mother’s request that the Father should also be liable for all incidentals regarding such classes and specifically stated that the expenses for all incidentals connected to xxx’s ballet and gymnastics classes required the Father’s prior consent before he was liable to make such payment.

26     In relation to xxx (the youngest child), the Court was of the view it was also necessary for the child’s educational well-being for her to continue at the Oak Tree Enrichment Centre as these classes had proved useful to assist the child with her transition to Primary 1. As such, the Court ordered that the Father should make payment for the youngest child’s anticipated Maths and English tuition at the Centre. As the Court was informed that there were outstanding monies owed to the Oak Tree Enrichment Centre for xxx’s attendance there in 2018, the Court also directed that the Father should make such payment to the Centre directly.

27     However, to make it clear that such additional payments were not to be expanded to include xxx’s new enrichment classes, the Court directed that the Father’s prior consent was required for all other activities/classes. This was to ensure that the Father’s consent was obtained before the Mother could enrol xxx in proposed ballet and gymnastic classes at her school.

28     Finally, the Court dismissed the Mother’s request for the Father to make prepayment for the said 3 children’s medical expenses in the sum of $500 and above as being unnecessary because the Father had already agreed to pay for all their medical expenses under the 10 January 2018 Consent Order.
