Costs

13 August 2019

### Assistant Registrar Colin Tan:

1       The Plaintiffs were beneficiaries under a Will while the Defendant was the Executor of the Will as well as the solicitor who drafted the Will for the Testator.

2       The Plaintiffs’ claim was essentially that the Testator had executed the Will due to the undue influence of the Defendant and, in the alternative, that the Testator did not know or approve of the contents of the Will. The Defendant denied this.

3       The Will in question provided that the Testator’s estate was to be paid to the Plaintiffs only upon the death of the Testator’s ex-wife.

4       The Testator and his ex-wife had gone through an acrimonious divorce, and there had been numerous related legal actions, e.g. application for enforcement by the Testator’s ex-wife (i.e. the Plaintiffs’ mother) against the Testator, application for maintenance by the 1st Plaintiff against the Testator, and a Maintenance of Parents Tribunal application by the Testator against the Plaintiffs. The Defendant had acted for or advised the Testator in some of these matters.

5       After hearing the parties and considering the evidence and submissions of counsel, I found that there was insufficient evidence to support the Plaintiffs’ claim and I therefore dismissed the claim.

6       In fact, the evidence was such that the Testator’s actions appeared rather reasonable – he had gone through an acrimonious divorce with his ex-wife and it would have appeared to him that the Plaintiffs had sided with his ex-wife in the divorce and related proceedings, and he would not have wanted his estate to be shared by the Plaintiffs with his ex-wife, and hence the stipulation in his Will that the Plaintiffs would only receive his estate upon the demise of his ex-wife.

7       It was also not unreasonable that he would have trusted the Defendant, who was his lawyer, to carry out his wishes.

8       The only surprising part of the Will was that the Testator had actually left his entire estate to the Plaintiffs given the history of litigation between them. Given this history, it would not have been surprising if he had left his estate to other persons instead.

9       Subsequently, the Plaintiffs filed a Summons for leave to appeal out of time. However, I dismissed this Summons as it was clear from the relevant Family Justice Rules provisions and the case law that such an application has to be filed at the High Court.

10     As costs could not be agreed by the parties, they were determined by taxation and the Plaintiffs have now appealed against my decision on taxation. I therefore set out herein the grounds of my decision.

11     The amounts claimed by the Defendant in his Bill of Costs were as follows:

> a.     Section 1 - $75,000

> b.     Section 2 - $1,600

> c.     Section 3 - $2,928,40

12     The Plaintiffs’ position on the amount of costs that ought to be ordered. as set out in their Notice of Dispute, was as follows:

> a.     Section 1 - $7,000

> b.     Section 2 - $800

> c.     Section 3 - $2,021.40

13     In respect of section 1, the main reasons for the Plaintiff’s position as set out in the Notice of Dispute, were as follows:

> a.     that case conferences are “not required” by the Family Justice Rules;

> b.     that the trial did not take the entire 5 days allocated to it;

> c.     that submissions on costs and jurisdiction were not necessary;

> d.     that the legal issues were not complex; and

> e.     that the Defendant’s Counsel would at most have spent a total of 7 days working on this matter.

14     My views on the Plaintiffs’ objections were as follows:

> a.     case conferences are an important part of how cases are managed and should be taken into account when awarding costs;

> b.     the trial did take the 5 days allocated to it although there may have been days with later start times or earlier end times;

> c.     submissions on costs and jurisdiction were part of this entire case and ought not to be disregarded when deciding on the quantum of costs to be awarded;

> d.     while the legal issues were not unduly complex, neither were they so exceptionally straightforward that costs should be severely discounted; and

> e.     while I was not in a position to comment on how long the Defendant ought to have spent on the case, this was not particularly important in the light of the methodology proposed by the Defendant as set out below.

15     The Defendant’s basis for his figure was as follows:

> a.     In _Basil Anthony Herman v Premier Security Co-operative Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGHC 48</span>, Choo Han Teck J held that a “range of costs between $10,000 and $20,000 for each day of trial is a useful guide”.

> b.     The Rules of Court provide that for an Order 14 judgment, the costs range from $4,000 to $15,000 for a High Court matter and from $3,000 to $10,000 for a District Court matter. Therefore, the costs awarded at the District Court level range from ⅔ to ¾ of that awarded for a High Court matter.

> c.     ¾ of $20,000 works out to $15,000 a day. When multiplied by 5 days, this works out to $75,000.

16     I was of the view that the figure proposed by the Plaintiffs (i.e. $7,000 for a 5-day trial) was unreasonably low, and I accepted that the methodology applied by the Defendant was not an unreasonable basis for arriving at a figure. However, the figure I reached differed from the Defendant’s figures for the following reasons:

> a.     I accepted the range of $10,000 to $20,000 put forward by the Defendant since it was based on case law. I also noted that this range was consistent with what is set out in Appendix G of the Supreme Court Practice Directions.

> b.     However, I did not agree with the Defendant’s Counsel that $20,000 should be the starting point for calculation. Given that the range put forward was $10,000 to $20,000, I felt that it would be fairer to use the mid-point, i.e. $15,000, as the starting point. I also noted that this was the amount set out in Appendix G for simple tort and contract claims. While I did not agree totally with the Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s characterisation of the complexity of this matter, I felt that using simple tort and contract claims as a starting point would be fair to the Plaintiffs in the sense of not overestimating the complexity of this matter.

> c.     In respect of the comparative costs amounts for High Court and District Court matters, I noted that a similar ratio could be seen in the Third Schedule of the Family Justice Rules.

> d.     However, I did not agree with the Defendant’s Counsel that a ratio of ¾ ought to be applied. Since the range was ⅔ to ¾, a mid-point ought to be used. I therefore used a figure of 0.71 for my calculations.

> e.     Applying this to the figures above resulted in the following – 71% of $15,000 worked out to $10,650 per day and this worked out to $53,250 when multiplied by 5 days.

> f.     I therefore ordered that the amount allowable under section 1 was to be $53,250.

17     In respect of section 2, I agreed with the Plaintiffs’ figure of $800 as I felt that this was a more reasonable amount.

18     In respect of section 3, the individual items disputed by the Plaintiffs, and the reasons for objecting, were as follows (and my views on the individual items are also set out below):

> a.     Filing Fees Item 2 ($23.20) – The Plaintiffs submitted that an affidavit of testamentary scripts by the Defendant was “not relevant”.

> Rule 260 of the Family Justice Rules requires Defendants to file an affidavit of testamentary scripts. As such, there was no basis for the Plaintiffs’ objection.

> b.     Filing Fees Item 4 ($28.40) – The Plaintiffs submitted that this had already been provided for previously.

> This item was conceded by the Defendant.

> c.     Filing Fees Item 7 ($146.60) – The Plaintiffs submitted that this Request for Transcripts / Grounds of Decision / Notes of Evidence was “not relevant”.

> I agreed with the Plaintiffs as this was related to an earlier appeal and not the main suit.

> d.     Filing Fees Item 14 ($17.60) – The Plaintiffs submitted that this was “already provided for”.

> This item concerned interrogatories. During the hearing, the Plaintiff’s Counsel stated that he did recall being served with interrogatories. I noted that the e-Litigation system did show interrogatories filed on the date in question. I therefore did not accept the Plaintiffs’ position on this item.

> e.     Filing Fees Item 17 ($207) and Item 18 ($121.20) – The Plaintiffs submitted that it was unreasonable for the Defendant to file a Bundle of Documents as he had already filed a Trial Bundle.

> During the hearing, the Plaintiff’s Counsel explained that there was an overlap between the documents in the Trial Bundles (which counsel explained were bundles of the affidavits of evidence in chief) and the documents in the Bundle of Documents.

> I noted that rule 567 of the Family Justice Rules require the filing of both a bundle of affidavits and a bundle of documents and rule 567(1)(b) envisages the possibility of documents in the bundle of documents being already present in the affidavits.

> As such, I did not accept the Plaintiffs’ position on this item.

> f.     Filing Fees Items 24 to 35 ($108) – The Plaintiffs submitted that these disbursements were incurred for submissions on probate jurisdiction and costs and leave to appeal.

> Issues of probate jurisdiction and costs were part of this matter and I therefore found in favour of the Defendant for items 24 to 29.

> I was unable to reconcile items 30 and 31 with the available records and both counsel very graciously agreed to concede one item each. As these items were $2 each, $2 was taxed off and $2 was allowed.

> Items 32 to 35 concerned the subsequent Summons for leave to appeal out of time and therefore should not have been part of the costs of the trial. I therefore found in favour of the Plaintiffs on this item.

> g.     Commissioning Fees Item 1 ($25) – This was related to the affidavit of testamentary scripts as set out above. As I found in favour of the Defendant on this issue as set out above, I allowed this item.

> h.     Transport costs ($180) – The Plaintiffs submitted that case conferences are not required.

> I did not agree with the Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s position and I allowed this item.

> i.     Miscellaneous Item 1 ($100) – The Plaintiffs submitted that this should be a figure of $50 instead.

> Considering how long this entire matter took and the amount of documents filed, I was of the view that $100 was not unreasonable.

19     Based on the above, the amount taxed off in respect of section 3 was $226.80.

20     As such, my decision on the taxation application was as follows:

> a.     Section 1 - the amount claimed was $75,000 and the final amount allowed was $53,250

> b.     Section 2 - the amount claimed was $1,600 and the final amount allowed was $800

> c.     Section 3 - the amount claimed was $2,928.40 and $226.80 was taxed off, and the final amount allowed was $2,701.60

> d.     Total - the amount claimed was $79,528.40 and the final amount allowed was $56,751.60
