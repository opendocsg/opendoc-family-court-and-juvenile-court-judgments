Access, variation of access, wishes of the child

28 January 2020

### District Judge Lim Keng Yeow:

#### Background

1       This matter involves cross-applications for the variation of terms of access to the children of the parties. As the issues relate to the parties’ roles as parents of the children, I refer to them as “the Father” and “the Mother”.

2       The parties got married on 9 Jun 2007. The Mother filed for divorce on 3 Oct 17, after which Interim Judgment (“IJ”) was obtained on 16 Apr 18, containing a global agreement reached by the parties on all ancillary matters. In relation to their three children, the IJ provided for their joint custody under both parents, with care and control to the Father, and with terms of access by the Mother being spelt out.

3       Following that, in the second half of 2018, both parties filed these cross-summonses, which came before me. After calling for and considering a Custody Evaluation Report (“CER”) put up by an agency working under the Ministry of Social and Family Development, I varied the access orders. Thereafter, the Father appealed against a number of these orders. These Grounds address his appeal.

#### The existing orders

4       Under the IJ, the Mother was to have access to the three children as follows:

> a.     Weekday - Twice a week (preferably on Monday, Tuesday or Thursday) from 5.30pm to 7.30pm;

> b.     Weekend – (i) Every Alternate Saturday from 2.00pm to 7.00pm; and (ii) Every Other Alternate Sunday from 8.00am to 1.00pm.

> c.     More flexible arrangements for access (eg. Overnight and overseas access) shall be discussed between the parties after the grant of Final Judgment.

#### The variations sought

5       The Mother (in SUM 2443/2018) sought to specify the days of the week on which access was to occur. She also sought an expansion of categories of access (i.e. on public holidays, school holidays, overseas access), all of which were to be unsupervised.

6       The Father, on the other hand (in SUM 3216/2018), sought restrictions to access, as follows:

> a.     That for 12 months following the date of the Order, the Plaintiff (Mother) shall have supervised access to the Children as follows:

>> (1)       Weekday – Once a week from 5.30pm to 6.45pm (preferably on a Monday or Tuesday);

>> (2)       Additional access during weekdays and weekends to be arranged and mutually agreed between the parties;

> b.     Supervised access arrangements shall be reviewed by the parties upon the expiry of the 12 month period.

He also wanted the Mother to be ordered to pay child maintenance (I dismissed this application and that decision was not appealed against, hence these Grounds will not address that issue).

#### Custody Evaluation Report

7       A preliminary issue raised before me on behalf of the Father was whether a Child Representative should be appointed to ensure that the children could be heard in relation to the issues.

8       I felt that the better approach was to call for a CER. There were three reasons for this:

> a)     At the time the matters came before me, the eldest girl, “Ade”, was 8+ years. The middle child, “Bob”, was 6+ years. The youngest, “Carrie”, was 3 years old[^1]. Given their ages, a Child Representative would probably be able to give the two older children a voice, but that would be all. A CER would achieve the same, and also go beyond it in being more holistic and effective in shedding light on the _overall circumstances_ of the family.

> b)     Carrie has a condition known as “harlequin ichthyosis”, resulting in uncontrolled skin growth. Both her hands have been amputated and she needs added care for her skin. A CER would better enquire into the implications of this on access by the Mother.

> c)     Certain counter-allegations in the parties’ affidavits concerning their sexual practices raised possible questions over safety issues for the children. I wanted some enquiry into whether there were any child protection concerns.

9       Hence, I called for a CER, and made an interim order for the Mother to have supervised access to the three children at a DSSA.

#### Orders made

10     The CER was furnished some four months later. Having considered the report and the submissions made by counsel on behalf of the parties, I decided that weekly access had to be made more definite, that access to the two older children can continue to be unsupervised, and that access on the whole ought to be expanded, albeit progressively. On 30 Oct 19, I made these orders:

> Paragraph 3b of the Interim Judgment dated 16 Apr 2018 is varied as follows:

>> (1)       The Plaintiff shall have unsupervised access to “Ade” and “Bob” as follows:

>>> (a)       Weekday access: every Monday and Friday from 5.30-7.30pm;

>>> (b)       Weekend access: every Saturday from 3.30-8.30pm, and from January 2020, every alternate week from Saturday 3.30pm overnight to Sunday 10.00am;

>>> (c)       Chinese New Year access:

>>>> (i)       On even years - from 8.00pm from 1st day overnight to 3.00pm on 2nd day and

>>>> (ii)     On odd years - from 8.00pm on the eve overnight to 3.00pm on 1st day;

>>> (d)       Public Holiday access (excluding Chinese New Year): alternate public holidays from 3.00-8.00pm;

>>> (e)       From 2020, School Holidays access in addition to other forms of access:

>>>> (i)       March and September holidays - from Monday 3.00pm overnight to Tuesday 8.00pm,

>>>> (ii)     Mid-year and year-end holidays - from Monday 3.00pm to Sunday 10.00am (on the 1st week of each of the holidays),

>>>> (iii)    The Plaintiff may bring the children overseas once yearly, either during the mid-year or year-end holidays. She is to give 2 months’ notice of her intention to the Defendant and furnish the Defendant the full itinerary 1 week from the date of departure. The children’s passports are to be handed to the Plaintiff when the itinerary is furnished and returned to the Defendant upon return.

>>> (f)       Handover of the children is to occur at the void deck of the children’s residence.

>> (2)       The Plaintiff shall have access to “Carrie” as follows:

>>> (a)       Supervised access every Saturday from 2.30-3.30pm;

>>> (b)       From January 2020, access every Saturday from 2.30-3.30pm shall be unsupervised;

>>> (c)       From April 2020, additional unsupervised access on Mondays from 5.30-7.30pm;

>>> (d)       Handover is to occur at the void deck.

#### Orders appealed against

11     The Father’s appeal is against:

> a)     For Ade and Bob –

>> i)       1(b): Overnight weekend access from January 2020,

>> ii)       1(c): Chinese New year access, and

>> iii)       1(e): School holidays and overseas access.

> b)     For Carrie –

>> i)       2(b): Unsupervised access from January 2020, and

>> ii)       2(c): Additional weeknight unsupervised access from Apr 2020.

#### Fundamental considerations

12     I begin at the fundamental starting position: the paramount consideration is the welfare and best interests of the children[^2]. Special circumstances aside, preservation of a child’s relationship with a parent not having care and control is generally regarded as something which advances the child’s welfare and best interests, and a child should be provided the widest latitude to continue to bond with that parent[^3].

13     The courts ought to have regard to the wishes of the parents as well as the child. The parents’ wishes would typically be in opposition to each other in such contested cases. Where that is so, it is not necessarily the wishes of the child’s mother or the parent with care and control that prevails. What prevails is the fundamental principle that it is the welfare of _the child_ that must be upheld.

14     In relation to the wishes of the child, the weight to be attached must depend on the child’s age, the extent to which the child’s true wishes can accurately be determined, and the extent to which the child’s wishes, even if fully and accurately conveyed, are truly in his or her best interests.

15     Much prudence is needed and, especially with children who are younger, applying a measure of judicial paternalism may be necessary. The courts should never ignore the expressed wishes of these young ones, but should similarly not treat them as determinative. Indeed, the younger the children, the greater the possibility that even orders contrary to their expressed wishes may have to be made, in furtherance of their best interests.

#### Honouring the spirit of the consent orders

16     In this case, the existing orders dated 16 Apr 2018 were agreed to by both parties, and were entered into just months prior to the cross applications. Obviously, neither side argued against the appropriateness of varying the orders so soon after they were entered into (as both parties sought variations to it). Despite that, I took the approach that the orders were not to be lightly brushed aside. Any variation to be made ought to be consistent with the spirit of the agreement and duly honour it.

17     In this regard, it must be recognised that the order provided for the Mother to have rather substantial unsupervised access on a weekly basis: two weekday periods of access (2 hours each) and weekend access (5 hours each time). More importantly, it also specifically contemplated the introduction of more “flexible” access arrangements (overnight and overseas access were stated as examples) after Final Judgment.

18     Material changes aside, the existing orders therefore seemed to favour subsequent expansion of access rather than its restriction. They also did not provide for supervised access or even envisage it, not even for Carrie.

#### Variation of orders relating to Ade and Bob

19     I turn now to address access specifically relating to Ade and Bob. The Father’s chief opposition to the Mother’s application for expanded access over them was simply that, this was not what the two children wanted (to be precise, it was not what Ade wanted, and Bob would follow suit)[^4]. This did not strike me as a compelling reason not to allow the Mother greater access, for several reasons.

20     Firstly, Ade, at 8+ years, was still not at an age where she would be able to determine what is in her best interests, and certainly still far from the age where it would be appropriate to allow her wishes to dictate her parent’s access terms. This was all the more so in relation to Bob. Secondly, the existing orders clearly contemplated such an expansion of access. This, rather than restriction of access, would be far more in keeping with the spirit of the orders. I also considered that there were no protective concerns or other good reasons militating against this.

21     In addition, I considered the CER. This was prepared after interviews with both Ade and Bob (and also all adults involved in their care), and took into account both parents’ interactions with the children and how interim access at a DSSA progressed.

22     It did report Ade’s wishes not to see the Mother very frequently. But, more importantly, it explained the reasons for this[^5]. Noting her reasons, I was not persuaded that restricting access was the answer or that expanding access would be inimical to her interests. The CER also noted indications of parental gatekeeping or alienation of the Mother, something the Mother alleged. It is not surprising if this had some influence on Ade’s expressed wishes.

23     On the whole, the CER did not report concerns over expansion of access. In fact, it recommended changes which went much further than what I eventually decided on[^6]. I was assured that Ade and Bob would come to adjust to access that is progressively expanded, and that being given such space to bond with their mother (without harming their relationship with their Father) was in their best interests[^7].

24     The Father raised other objections to the Mother having increased access, asserting that she would sometimes be late for access, she was unable to manage the children, and she would get upset with the children during access. I did not think that these were valid objections, nor amounted to material changes in circumstances preventing increased access. There were also no indications in the CER that these issues would make longer hours of access either unworkable or contrary to the children’s best interests[^8].

#### Variation of orders relating to Carrie

25     Moving on to access to Carrie, the Father’s chief concern was the Mother’s ability to tend to Carrie’s medical needs. Acting out of these concerns, he had imposed on the Mother the restriction of having only supervised access even where the consent orders did not stipulate so.

26     I noted the absence of anything indicating that any special training or technical ability on the part of the Mother was needed. It appeared that what is of concern is the _management_ of Carrie’s condition during access (not that the caregiver has to administer any _treatment_). What is more important then, would be to know which environments were suitable for her and which would be less so, and that her skin must be kept clean and moist through the application of relevant ointments or moisturisers. No good reasons were offered as to why the Mother could not acquire such knowledge or ability to care for Carrie, to whatever extent she has not in fact already done so.

27     Notwithstanding the above, I decided to proceed cautiously. Since access had so far been supervised, I felt it prudent to have that continue. With another 2 months of such supervised access, she ought to be able to move on to having unsupervised access. I had every reason to expect that during the forthcoming 8-9 weeks of access, she would gain competence to the point where she would soon be able to manage Carrie on her own (if she had not already acquired such competence already).

28     As a further act of prudence, I also decided that even when she would start to have unsupervised access, it should initially be only for 1 hour. It is only 4 months thereafter that she would progress to another 2 hours of unsupervised access at night along with the older children, by which time she would also have had more time with them and be more adept at handling them.

29     The progression, in my view, would be modest and sufficiently gradual. Even though the Mother sought for Carrie terms of access that were as wide as what she sought for the two older children, I decided that providing for that right now would not be prudent and would be best left to after unsupervised access stabilises.

#### Conclusion

30     It is sadly unfortunate that post-divorce co-parenting is all too often plagued by parental gatekeeping and triangulation of the children, and that parents engaged in such behaviours are unable to see the extent to which they themselves bring harm to the child, and also damage their own relationship with the child.

31     To whatever extent that may have been so in this case, it is hoped that the parties will seek to develop their own relationship with the children whilst honouring the children’s bond with the other parent, doing nothing that will cause that bond any harm. This probably upholds the children’s long-term best interests far more than the parties may realise at the moment.
