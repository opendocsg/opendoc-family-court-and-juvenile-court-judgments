Division of Matrimonial Property – Custody Care and Control and Access – Maintenance for Former Spouse and Children

4 September 2019

### District Judge Goh Zhuo Neng:

## A.   INTRODUCTION

1       This was an ancillary matters hearing. The Plaintiff Mother (“**Mother**”) and Defendant Father (“**Father**”) were represented by counsel. After hearing parties and considering their submissions, I made orders on the division of matrimonial property as well as maintenance for the 2 children of the marriage (“**Children**”), which are broadly set out below.

> (a)     Division of Matrimonial Property – Parties would retain assets in their names and possession, save for transfer of monies held in a joint account and with stakeholders, and monies in the Father’s Central Provident Fund (“**CPF**”) Account, which would all take place within 2 weeks of my order. The full orders on division are set out at **Annex A**.

> (b)     Custody Care and Control and Access – That the parties have joint custody of the Children, with the Mother having Care and Control and the Father having access. The full orders on access are set out at **Annex B**.

> (c)     Maintenance for the Mother – That there be no maintenance for the Mother.

> (d)     Maintenance for the Children – That the Father pay the Mother maintenance of $3,600.00 a month as maintenance for the 2 children beginning from 1 June 2019, and thereafter on the 1st day of each month. Payment would be into the Mother’s designated account.

2       On 11 June 2019, the Father filed his Notice of Appeal. The Mother has not appealed against my decision. I set out below the full grounds of my decision.

## B.   BACKGROUND

3       The parties were married on 6 January 2004. The writ of divorce was filed on 19 October 2017. Interim Judgement was made on 16 May 2018, making this a 14 year marriage.

4       The Children were 2 boys aged 6 and 8 in 2019. The Mother was currently working odd-jobs, and the Father was employed as a District Manager for a multinational company.

## C.   DIVISION OF MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY

#### I.    The Law

5       Here, I applied the structured approach as stated in the Court of Appeal decision in _ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span>, \[23\] :

> a)     Step 1 - Express as a ratio the parties’ direct contributions relative to each other, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets.

> b)     Step 2 - Express as a second ratio the parties’ indirect contributions relative to each other, having regard to both financial and non-financial contributions.

> c)     Step 3 - Derive the parties’ overall contributions relative to each other by taking an average of the two ratios above (the derived ratio shall be referred to as “the average ratio”).

6       If the same weight is given to both direct and indirection contributions, the average ratio derived in Step 3 need not be adjusted (_ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span>, \[37\]). However, depending on the circumstances of each case, the direct and indirect contributions may not be accorded equal weight under Step 3, and one of the two ratios in Step 1 and 2 may be accorded more significance than the other. Adjustments can also be made in respect of other relevant factors under s 112 or 114(1) of the Women’s Charter (_ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span>. \[28\])

#### II.    Value of Matrimonial Assets

7       The assets of the parties and my valuation of these assets are set out in **Annex C**. They were valued at a total of $1,130,656.84. With regard to the valuation of the assets, I generally adopted the most recent valuations as the value of the matrimonial assets should be assessed as at the date of the hearing of ancillary matters (_Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo Nancy_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 2 SLR 1157</span>).

8       With regard to bank accounts, I took a date as close as possible to the date of filing of the writ on 19 October 2019, so that there would be less issue taken with subsequent withdrawals from the bank account during the course of the divorce proceedings. _TBZ v TCA_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHCF 18</span>, \[28\].

## D.   DIVISION OF MATRIMONIAL ASSETS – DIRECT FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS

## I.    Property/Vehicles/Specific Accounts

9       The assessment of the parties’ direct contributions to their assets required some approximation and tracing. This was because the bulk of the matrimonial assets comprised of the proceeds of sale of their properties, vehicles they had acquired, and the two bank accounts into which most of these proceeds had been deposited into – the Father’s UOB Account No. ‘B’ (“**Father’s UOB Account**”) and the joint account held in both parties’ names with OCBC No. ‘C’ (“**Smart Parent Account**”).

10     I address each of these assets below.

#### The ‘D’ (“ **The D** ”)

11     The ‘D’ was a property that was owned in both parties’ name. It was purchased in 3 August 2009 and sold during the course of the divorce proceedings, with the sale being completed in August 2018.

12     The accountable proceeds from the ‘D’ were as follows:

> a)     $7,464.55 – currently held by the Mother’s solicitors as stakeholders.

> b)     $10,880.00 – deposited into the Smart Parent Account on 25 May 2018.

> c)     $4,413.05 – deposited into the Smart Parent Account on 4 September 2018.

13     The contributions of the parties which I could ascertain by evidence were a total of $331,796.91:

> a)     Father’s withdrawn CPF principal - $169,206.59

> b)     Mother’s withdrawn CPF principal - $129,990.32

> c)     Mother’s cash contribution - $32,600.00 comprising of the sums of $27,600 and $5,000.00 that were paid on the 29 July 2009 – the same date a cashier’s order of $27,600.00 was issued to the conveyancing lawyers.

> d)     Father’s cash contribution – Zero. The Father was only able to provide proof of a deposit of $5,000.00 into his account on 29 July 2009, which was insufficient to prove his contribution.

14     On the basis of the above, I found that the Father’s direct contribution in respect of the ‘D’ and its proceeds was 51%, and the Mother’ direct contribution 49%.

#### ‘E’ (“ **E** ”)

15     ‘E’ was a property held in the Mother’s sole name. It was purchased in 2012, and sold during the divorce proceedings in December 2017.

16     The proceeds from ‘E’ were accounted for as follows:

> a)     $243,420.29 – Currently in the Smart Parent Account.

> b)     $8,700.00 – The refund of the deposit which was used by the Mother for expenses.

> c)     $39,373.68 – It was used by the Mother for expenses.

> d)     $1,775.63 – This was the interest earned from placing the sum of $243,420.29 under (a) into an interest bearing fixed deposit account. It was used by the Mother for expenses.

17     Both parties submitted that with respect to the acquisition of ‘E’, their direct contributions were 50-50. The Mother claimed that her contribution to the cost of renovations should also be regarded as a contribution. I declined to do so as the Mother was not able to prove that the renovations were sufficient to substantially add value to ‘E’.

18     On the basis of the above, I found that the ratio of the parties’ direct contributions to ‘E’ and its proceeds was 50:50.

#### ‘F’

19     The ‘F’ was registered in the Father’s name. It was purchased in 2008, and was scrapped in September 2018. The ‘F’ was also registered with a customised plate which was currently in the possession of the Father.

20     The accountable proceeds from the ‘F’ were as follows:

> a)     $13,281.00 – the scrap proceeds which were deposited into the Smart Parent Account. Parties agreed this was done, but were unable to provide a date of deposit. This was likely however to have taken place in or after September 2018.

> b)     $1,300.00 – the amount which the Father paid the Land Transport Authority (“**LTA**”) to renew the customised plate. The Father claimed the value of the plate was $2,300.00 but was unable to provide a basis for this.

21     Both parties agreed that their direct contributions to the proceeds of the ‘F’ should be treated equally.

22     On the basis of the above, I found that the ratio of the parties’ direct contributions to the ‘F’ and its proceeds was 50:50, and that the Father’s direct contribution to the customised plate of the ’F’ should be 100%. This will be relevant later as the proceeds of the ‘F’ were subsequently deposited into the Smart Parent Account.

#### ‘G’

23     The ‘G’ was acquired in or about 2012. It was sold during the divorce proceedings in or about October 2017.

24     The accountable proceeds from the ’G’ were as follows:

> a)     $15,500.00 – the Father admitted to using this amount to acquire the ‘H’.

> b)     $23,500.00 – the Father admitted to depositing it into the Father’s UOB Account in October 2017.

25     Parties agreed that their direct contributions to the ‘G’ should be treated equally.

26     On the basis of the above, I found that the ratio of the parties’ direct contributions to the ‘G’ and its proceeds was 50-50. This will be relevant later in determining the Father’s contribution to the ‘H’ and the parties’ contributions to the Father’s UOB Account.

#### ‘H’

27     The ‘H’ was purchased by the Father during the divorce proceedings in October 2017.

28     The Mother claimed that the car had been scrapped as the result of an accident that had occurred after the interim judgement, and that the Father had acquired a new ‘H’. The Father claimed that the ‘H’ should be attributed its scrap value. The proceeds of scrappage were $32,438.00 – making reference to payments of $638.00 and $31,800.00 by the LTA to the UOB account on 5 October 2018.

29     The just and equitable approach here would be to use the value of the original ‘H’ prior to the accident as the accident had occurred after the interim judgement.

30     The Father submitted that the sale price of the ‘H’ should be $34,800 on a PARF basis. I felt that this was not realistic as the price in the open market would be more relevant. The Mother in her first affidavit of assets and means (“**AOMs**”) filed in July 2018, was able to provide proof of an asking price of $44,500.00 on the SGCarmart website, for a similar ‘H’ which was also registered in November 2009. I accepted this as the sale value of the car.

31     As to the outstanding loan of the car, the Father’s counsel confirmed that at the date of the first exchange of the AOMs in July 2018, $17,010.00 of the $33,788.00 loan taken by the Father to purchase the ‘H’ had been paid, leaving an outstanding balance of $20,778.00. I accepted this as the outstanding loan of the car.

32     Taking into account the sale value of $44,500.00 and deducting the outstanding loan balance of $20,778.00, the net positive value of the ‘H’was $23,722.00.

33     Here, I found that the direct contributions of the parties to the acquisition of the ‘H’ amounted to $32,510.00:

> a)     $15,500.00 – the downpayment was derived from the sale proceeds of the ‘G’ and will be apportioned 50-50 between the parties.

> b)     $17,010.00 - the loan repayment as at the date of the first AOMs will be attributed 100% to the Father.

34     On the basis of the above, I found that the ratio of the parties’ direct contributions to the ‘H’ and its proceeds was 23.8:76.2 in favour of the Father. When this ratio is pro-rated to the ‘H’s value of $23,722.00, the direct contributions attributable to each party from the ‘H’ are $5,645.84 : $18,076.16 in favour of the Father.

#### ‘J’ (“ **J** ”)

35     The ’J’ was a motorcycle in the Mother’s name. It was sold in May 2018. There was some dispute here in respect of whether there were any proceeds.

36     The Father claimed that the net proceeds of the ‘J’ should be $12,000.00. This was based on a “_Payment Voucher_” from Excel Cycle, which stated that the Mother was to be paid $12,000.00.

37     However, the document also indicated that there were also :

> a)     A “_Settlement_” of $10,039.40 due to Excel Cycle.

> b)     “_Late Interest_” of $379.40.

> c)     “_Late Charges_” of $700.00.

> d)     A “_Consignment_” of $500.00.

> e)     A “_Duplicate Key_” charge of $72.00.

> f)     An “_LTA return_” of $1,880.00.

> g)     An amount “_Due to ECC_” of $1,872.00.

38     It was quite impossible to arrive at an interpretation of this accounting that would reconcile all the above figures. I took the view that there was no positive balance left after the sale of the ‘J’ as it was stated quite clearly in (g) that even after the sale of $12,000.00, an amount of $1,872.00 was still due to Excel Cycle, which I accepted. Therefore there was no positive sale, and I attributed a zero value to the ‘J’ and its proceeds.

#### Father’s UOB Account

39     The Father’s UOB Account held a balance of $39,727.13 as of 16 October 2017, which is as close as I could get to the date of the writ. I adopted this figure as a starting point for valuation, as it takes into account the deposit of the sales proceeds of the ‘G’ amounting to $39,000.00.

40     My assessment of the parties’ direct contributions to this amount and the value of the monies in the account are as follows.

> a)     $727.13 - which is the original balance before the sum of $39,000.00 from the net proceeds of the ‘G’ was deposited, which is fully attributable to the Father.

> b)     $23,500.00 – the balance of the $39,000.00 which remains. This will be attributable 50-50 to the parties as it derives from the ‘G’.

> c)     $15,500.00 – part of the $39,000.00 which was used to pay for the down payment for the ’H’. I will not include this as part of the value of the Father’s UOB Account, as I do not want to double count my assessment of the ‘H’. Therefore the assessed value of the Father’s UOB Account is the sum of (a) and (b) above, being $24,227.13.

41     On the basis of the above, I found that the value of the Father’s UOB account was $24,227.13, and that the direct contributions attributable to each party are $12,477.13: $11,750.00 in favour of the Father.

#### Smart Parent Account

42     Parties agreed that the current balance in the Smart Parent Account as of May 2019 was $258,169.72. The direct contributions attributable to the parties totalling $273,024.98 are as follows:

> a)     $1,030.64 – This was the starting balance as at 11 October 2017, which is as close as I could get to the date of the writ, which I attributed 50-50 between the parties as this was a joint account.

> b)     $243,420.29 – These were the proceeds from ‘E’, which I attributed 50-50 between the parties.

> c)     $13,281.00 – These were the proceeds from the ‘F’, which I attributed 50-50 between the parties.

> d)     $4,413.05 – These were the proceeds from the ‘D’, which I had attributed 51:49 in favour of the Father.

> e)     $10,880.00 – These were the proceeds from the ‘D’, which I had attributed 51:49 in favour of the Father.

43     While the total contributions to this account are less than the current balance, I accepted the Father’s submission that monies were withdrawn from this account to repay liabilities owed by the parties.

44     As the various contributions of the parties to the account were very close to 50-50, I adopted a broad brush approach and attributed the direct contribution attributable to each party in respect of the current balance of $258,169.72 for the Smart Parent Account, in a 50:50 proportion between the parties.

### II.    Father’s Insurance Policies

45     The Father had several insurance policies in his name. A surrender value was provided for only some of these policies, so examining the nature of the policies and the amounts payable in respect of these policies, I drew my own inferences on what the surrender value would be for these properties. My analysis is set out below.

#### ‘K’

46     This policy comprised of a “_TM Legacy Plus_”, “_+DD Accelerator Rider_”, “_Enhanced Payer Benefit Rider_” + _“Enhanced Spouse Rider_”. The policies were for the benefit of the Father, Mother and one of the Children. The premiums were payable on a quarterly basis of $384.35 – this was a net premium per person of about $42.70 a month.

47     The surrender value was not disclosed. In my view, it was quite unlikely to be a savings policy with significant value given that the net premium per person was not particularly high.

#### ‘L’

48     This policy comprised of a “_TN Education_”, “_Enhanced Payer Benefit Rider_” + “_Enhanced Spouse Rider_”. The policies were for the benefit of the Father and Mother. The premiums were payable on a quarterly basis of $849.50, with the premium for the “_TN Education_” being $815.70 – this was a net premium per person of about $271.90 a month.

49     The surrender value was not disclosed. In my view, it was likely to be a savings policy, and I valued it from November 2012 (month of commencement of policy) to May 2019 (the month of the ancillary matters hearing), being 79 months at $271.90 a month.

50     This gave me a total contribution of $21,480.10 which I took as the value of the policy and attributed the 100% contribution to the Father as the policies were in his name.

#### ‘M’

51     The policy was solely for the benefit of the Father. The Father submitted that premiums were payable on a quarterly basis of $879.96 – this was a net premium per person of about $219.99 a month. I accepted this as it appeared to be similar to the print out of the policy statement that the Father provided in evidence.

52     The surrender value was not disclosed. In my view, it was likely to be a savings policy, and I valued it from June 2014 (month of commencement of policy) to May 2019 (the month of the ancillary matters hearing), being 59 months at $219.99 a month.

53     This gave me a total contribution of $12,979.41 which I took as the value of the policy and attributed the 100% contribution to the Father as the policies were in his name.

#### ‘N’ and ‘O’

54     The Father provided evidence of the surrender value of the ‘N’ and ‘O’, which were valued at $16,968.51 and zero respectively. I took them as the respective values of the policies and attributed the 100% contribution to the Father as the policies were in his name.

### III.    Mother’s Insurance Policies

55     Similarly, I also assessed the possible surrender value of the Mother’s insurance policies which were solely for her benefit. No surrender value was disclosed for these policies.

#### ‘P’

56     This was a “_Vivolife_” policy with a monthly premium of $79.90. I took the view that it was unlikely to be a savings plan given the relatively low sum, and attributed a zero value to it.

#### ‘Q’

57     This addressed a variety of accident cover with a monthly premium of $64.78. I took the view that it was unlikely to be a savings plan given the relatively low sum, and attributed a zero value to it.

### IV.    Items in the Safe/Watches

58     The Father alleged that there were items in the family safe belonging to him, namely:

> a)     Watches

>> a.       Rolex Explorer – purchased second hand at $5,000.00 – valued at $5,000.00

>> b.       Rolex Datejust – purchased second hand at $5,000.00 so each party would have a Rolex – valued at $4,800.00

>> c.       Uboat – purchased at GBP1,800 (about SGD 3,100.00) – valued at $2,000.00

>> d.       Chopard XL – purchased at $4,900.00 – valued at $4,900.00

> b)     Jewellery – total value of $6,500.00

>> a.       4 gold pendants (3 shaped as a little boy and one as a little girl)

>> b.       1 gold bracelet

>> c.       1 gold chain and gold cross

>> d.       1 gold ring

>> e.       Father’s wedding band

59     There was no proof of purchase provided for the watches, and no documentary valuation provided for the watches or the jewellery. The Mother claimed that both Rolexes were stolen and referred to a police report dated 30 October 2018 where she claimed that the Rolex Explorer was stolen when she tried to sell it, and valued it at $11,200.00. She also claimed that the Father knew the Chopard was no longer in her possession. As for the jewellery, she claimed that only the gold pendant shaped like a little girl was in her possession.

60     In the end, I took the view that only the Rolexes could be attributed a value as it was not clear whether the remaining watches and jewellery were of sufficient value to be included as matrimonial assets. Therefore, I attributed a broad brush value of $10,000.00 for both Rolex watches and attributed 100% contribution to the Father.

### V.    Remaining Assets

61     My treatment of the remaining assets in the Father’s name are set out in the table below. I attributed 100% of the direct contribution for these assets to the Father.

62     My treatment of the remaining assets in the Mother’s name are set out in the table below. I attributed 100% of the direct contribution for these assets to the Mother.

63     I elaborate that shortly after they received their CPF refunds from the ‘D’ in August 2018, the parties proceeded to purchase properties in their name. I took the view it was not necessary to trace into the current values of these properties as they had been purchased after the granting of the interim judgement. Therefore, I took the CPF values as of August 2018 as they would have represented the amount of CPF utilised for the ‘D’.

64     In the case of the Mother, I also added back an amount of $28,000.00 that had been withdrawn in 7 June 2018 to purchase an investment product from Prudential, which I also omitted from the division of matrimonial property to avoid double counting.

### VI.    Ratio of Direct Contributions

65     Taking the above into account, the direct contributions of the parties was 56:44 in favour of the Father, based on $1,130,656.84 of assets. While the parties in particular the Father, had various credit card loans, these were not mortgaged against any of the assets, so I did not deduct them from the gross value of the above assets. The table setting out my attribution of the direct contributions to the parties based on the respective assets is set out at **Annex C**.

## E.   DIVISION OF MATRIMONIAL ASSETS – INDIRECT FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS

66     In respect of the parties’ indirect financial contributions, I appreciated that the marriage had been divided into two stages.

> a)     Stage 1 - 2004 – 2011 (7 years) – Both parties worked and shared the contributions to the household. There were no children.

> b)     Stage 2 - 2011 – 2018 (7 years) – Both parties worked and shared the contributions to the household. During this period, the parties had the Children, and the Mother would take months off during each child’s birth to care for them. From 2014, the Father also took up a new job with his current employer where he begin to earn more than the Mother, and travel more extensively.

67     On this point, parties submitted on how they had been supportive of each other throughout the difficulties in their own lives. They also referred to the financial contributions made during the marriage to the household, with each party claiming they had contributed more.

68     Here, the Mother claimed that she would be taking care of the Children during Stage 2 in the evenings and weekends as the Father was constantly travelling, and should be entitled to 70% indirect contributions with 60% weightage on these contributions. The Father in turn claimed that his work hours were flexible and that he spent a considerable amount of time with the Children, therefore the indirect contributions should be 55:45 in favour of him.

69     On indirect financial contributions, I think the Father would have contributed more by virtue of his higher earning capacity – which was not disputed.

70     On indirect non-financial contributions for each other, generally under Stage 1 neither party could have been regarded as contributing more than the other as there were no children then.

71     As for indirect non-financial contributions under Stage 2, I considered the extent of caregiving provided by each party for the Children. As both parents were working during the day, the Children were placed in childcare, and were usually sent and picked up from the Paternal Grandparent’s home.

72     I took the view that it was more likely that the Mother had made a greater indirect non-financial contribution as she was the parent who was present in Singapore most of the time. While the Father claimed that he had flexible work hours due to his travel, and arranged his departure and returns to maximise him time with the Children, there was next to no evidence provided on the exact timings of his travel.

73     What was submitted to me, was a table setting out the dates of travel in a voluntary affidavit dated 18 April 2019 (pages 2-4). It indicated that from the dates 25 January 2015 to 27 October 2017, the Father travelled on 91 occasions for work. This amounted to travel on 3 out of 5 weeks at a time.

74     Taking into account the Mother’s greater indirect non-financial contribution as a caregiver during Stage 2, I took the view she should be entitled to a greater indirect contribution on balance, but as this had only been the case for half the marriage, the ratio should only be 60:40 in her favour.

## E.   DIVISION OF MATRIMONIAL ASSETS – APPLICATION OF RATIO

75     Taking the average of the above ratios, the assets should be distributed 52:48 in favour of the Mother.

76     This meant that the Mother would be entitled to $587,941.55 of the matrimonial assets.

77     This would require the following transfers to the Mother, which I ordered would take place in 2 weeks:

> a)     The proceeds from the ‘D’ of $7,464.55 will be transferred from the Mother’s Lawyers to the Mother.

> b)     The monies in the Smart Parent Account will be divided as follows:

>> a.       To the Mother - $113,022.02.

>> b.       To the Father – The remainder.

> c)     The Father will transfer $87,762.09 from his CPF Special Account to the Mother’s CPF Special Account.

78     In my view, this approach was necessary as the parties no longer had much monies in their CPF Ordinary accounts for distribution – having bought properties recently. By effecting the bulk of the property transfer in terms of the Father’s CPF Special account, he would be allowed to keep the bulk of monies in the Smart Parent Account – which amounted to about $258,169.72 before division to the Mother. Each party would have at least $100,000.00 each in cash to move on with their lives.

## F.   CUSTODY CARE AND CONTROL AND ACCESS

79     Both parents wanted custody of the Children. The Mother claimed that she was the primary caregiver. The Father claimed that the Mother was alienating the Children from him and was mentally unstable. I will address these issues separately below.

### I.    Mother’s Mental Stability

80     The Father claimed that the Mother was mentally unstable as she had tried to kill herself several times during the marriage, and had also been admitted to the Institute of Mental Health (“**IMH**”). The Father also claimed that the Mother had a short fuse and in support of this, made reference to incidents that had occurred during the marriage, which he claimed he had omitted from the Statement of Particulars in the interest of obtaining a quick divorce. The Father also included 900 pages of text messages between himself and the Mother covering the period from 2010 to 2017, drawing attention to specific instances where the Mother had lost her temper at him.

81     The sheer bulk of evidence directed at the Mother’s conduct would have been more appropriate for a contested divorce. This evidence was largely unhelpful to my determination of who would be a better caregiver to the Children. The incidents referred to by the Father mostly involved incidents between him and the Mother, although he would also make reference to how she treated her colleagues, friends and maids.

82     There were certainly occasions where the Mother did get angry with the Children (see paragraph 111 of the Father’s Affidavit dated 29 January 2019 and the transcripts referred to). This in my view did not amount to a form of abuse, as the Mother appeared to be a strict disciplinarian, but nothing more.

83     As for the Mother’s mental stability, she admitted that she had tried to commit suicide on previous occasions and had been admitted to IMH. A report dated 22 April 2019 was provided by IMH confirming that the Mother had been admitted previously in 2016 and 2017, and was treated with medication and therapy. It also confirmed that when she was last seen in October 2018, she was stable and a recommendation was made that she continue psychiatric follow up. The Mother confirmed she was doing so and tendered a report from her personal psychiatrist in support of this.

84     On the issue of allegations of mental instability, it has to be accepted that parties may suffer from various conditions or endure challenges to their mental stability. That in my view should not prevent any of them from being a good parent to their children. The Court must ask itself, what is best for the children, and in doing so, ask what is the effect of the condition on that parent’s ability to be a caregiver.

85     It should be noted that throughout all the difficulties in the parties’ marriage and her admission to IMH in 2016 and 2017, the Mother had continued to take care of the Children, and they were never placed in any danger, or suffered any abuse. So in the circumstances, I did not regard the Mother’s suicide attempts or admissions to IMH as factors affecting her ability to be a caregiver.

86     Separately, the Father also referred to matters that were the subject of proceedings under the Prevention of Harassment Act and personal protection orders. I did not give any of these allegations weight insofar as they related to incidents that occurred between the parties.

### II.    Alienation

87     The Father also claimed that the Mother was alienating the Children from him. Examples of this included:

> a)     How following the commencement of divorce proceedings in November 2017, the Mother had started attending personally to the Children which she had not done previously.

> b)     How the Mother had refused on specific occasions to let him take the Children out, and kept him separate from them, and had breached a court order dated 6 June 2018, by refusing to attend at the Immigration Checkpoint Authority (“**ICA**”) together with him to collect the Children’s passports, and failed to let him know that the Children were in Johor Bahru instead of travelling to Melaka as previously notified.

> c)     How the Mother had been pressuring the Children during his holiday with them in June 2018, to spend less time with him and called him “_that man_”.

88     I found that in respect of paragraph 87(a), it was quite impossible to imagine that the Mother had never attended personally to the Children prior to the commencement of divorce proceedings in November 2017. As explained above, the Father was constantly travelling, and the Children were either in childcare or with his parents during the weekdays. That left the Mother at home to take care of them.

89     In respect of paragraph 87(b), I was aware that as of 7 February 2018, the parties had agreed by a consent order that the Father would have regular access to the Children as follows:

> a)     Every Tuesday and Thursday from 5pm to 9.30pm.

> b)     Every Saturday from 6.30pm to 9.30pm.

> c)     Every Sunday, from 9.00am to 1.00pm.

90     The Father did not complain that he was being refused access ordered under this agreement between the parties. However, he did note that the Children were being sent for enrichment activities during his access. There were other unfortunate disputes referred to by the Father about how the Mother tried to alienate him and disrupt his access. In my view, it was sufficient to simply refer to one set of incidents to understand whether the Mother was intentionally alienating the Children from the Father. This is discussed in respect of (c) below.

91     In respect of paragraph 87(c), the Father provided transcripts of audio recordings between the Children and the Mother. These recordings were taken during the Children’s travels with the Father during the mid-year school holidays in 2018. During these conversations, the Mother:

> a)     Praised one of the Children for not taking pictures with the Father.

> b)     Referred to the Father as “_that man_” repeatedly. This caused the Children to do the same.

> c)     Asked one of the Children if he had “_cried for Mommy_”. This was understandable as one of the other Children had informed her on an earlier occasion that this Child was crying for her.

> d)     Asked the Children to call her at night, even though the terms of an order dated 6 June 2018 (paragraph 6(c)), provided that calls from a non-travelling parent should only be made to the children once a day before 11.00am.

92     In her 2nd affidavit dated 29 January 2019, which was filed in reply to these allegations, the Mother denied that she had done so. This was clearly not consistent with the transcripts. When I pointed this out to the Mother’s counsel during the hearing, the explanation given was that the Mother’s behaviour was not excusable and that in mitigation, this had occurred during the period in which divorce proceedings had been commenced. I explained that there was no excuse for this, as the divorce proceedings had commenced in November 2017, and the above conversations took place in the mid year in 2018 some 6 months later.

93     The behaviour of the Mother on this occasion suggested to me that there was certainly a great deal of animosity between the Mother and Father. The Mother in particular seemed to be unhappy with the Father’s decision to divorce her and held him responsible for the dissolution of the marriage. Unfortunately, this was manifesting itself in a negative fashion where the Children were concerned and would have the potential to alienate the Children from the Father in the long run.

### III.    Decision

94     Here, the case of _ABW v ABV_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 769</span> comes to mind. The High Court found that if the parent having care and control of a child had been deliberately or unconsciously interfering with the bond between the child and the other parents, switching the care and control was a potential remedy. A case where a child who had previously been loving with the non-custodial parent but now showed a reluctance to be in contact with that parent might call for this approach \[27\] to \[29\].

95     However, in the present case it might not be necessary to take the step of awarding the Father care and control of the Children.

> a)     While the Mother’s conduct towards the Children would lead to alienation, it was not clear to me that the Children were showing a reluctance to be in contact with the Father. The transcripts referred to in paragraph 91 above, also continued to record the Children’s conversations with the Father after they had stopped speaking with the Mother, and these conversations appeared to be completely regular conversations. The Children did not show any friction in their conversations with the Father or dislike of the Father. The Father was also able to provide pictorial evidence of himself having a great time with the Children.

> b)     Giving the Father care and control was no guarantee of stability for the Children. He was constantly travelling, and while he claimed to be travelling only on the weekdays and at “_off peak_” timings at late light and returning in the early morning, there was no proof of this. If the Father was travelling in 3 out of 5 weeks, and only on weekdays, how much of him would the Children see, considering that they would be with the Mother on the weekend? While he claimed that his parents could take care of the Children, there was no clear plan in his evidence on how they would do so.

96     Taking into account the Mother’s actions towards the Children, and the Father’s constant travelling, I decided the best balance would be struck if the parties were to have joint custody, with care and control to the Mother. This would give the Children a stronger sense of stability, as out of the two parents, the Mother had been more present and involved during the marriage due the Father’s travelling.

97     While the Mother’s conduct was a cause for concern, I felt however the matter had not escalated to the point where it was necessary to give the Father care and control. As the Mother’s unhappiness with the Father arose from her resentment against the Father for ending the marriage, they could be addressed in the present case by sending parties and the Children to Children in Between counselling. The counselling would help to transition the parties from their status of conflict to a status of being more circumspect about how they had to progress to being co-parents and more conscious about the way in which their actions were affecting the Children.

98     I must emphasise that I am not intending to incentivise parents who act in this way. Just because the Children were not completely alienated from the Father does not mean that the Court should not take such behaviour into account when making subsequent orders on access. To remedy the negative behaviour of the Mother, I provided that the Father would be given more access so that he could spend more time with the Children and strengthen his bond with them. I ordered that the Father would have regular access to the Children as follows:

> a)     Week day access – Tuesday (6pm to 930pm). Pick up from the respective student care or childcare of both Children.

> b)     Weekend access – Friday 6pm to Sunday 10am. Pick up from the respective student care or childcare of both Children and return to the Mother’s residence.

99     This would give the Father two nights of overnight access on the weekend, with a full 24 hours of access on Saturday. Bearing in mind that that the Father’s access should be meaningful, I provided that each party may enrol the Children for activities when the Children are with them, but not when the Children are with another parent.

100    However to strike a balance and preventing the Mother from being the parent whose time with the Children was saddled with activities, I provided that the Mother may enrol the Children for 1 activity during the Father’s weekend access, which should last no more than 1.5 hours. This was fair, considering that the Father would have a full 24 hours with the Children on Saturday. I also provided that the Mother will disclose to the Father the schools, childcare and student care attended by the Children and her residence by 12.30pm, 30 May 2019. Should there be any changes, the Mother will notify the Father within 24 hours.

101    My remaining orders in respect of the access are set out at **Annex B**. An explanation of my decisions are as follows:

> a)     Public Holiday access would be alternated and exclude school holiday access, so that the school holiday access was not interrupted. Chinese New Year (“**CNY**”) access over the eve, 1st and 2nd day of CNY was provided for separately and followed the terms of a consent order dated 7 February 2018, save that I allowed the Children to be returned later at 10.30pm on the 1st day of CNY as it was still a holiday the next day, and that the parent taking the Children on the 2nd day would have them for a longer period of time starting from 9.00am instead of 12.00 noon, but return them a little earlier at 8.00pm instead of 9.00pm as it might be a school day the next day.

> b)     Public Holiday access would take place from 9.00am to 8.00pm, and not as a form of overnight access as this might be too disruptive for the Children. After all, each parent, including the Father, were already having considering overnight access with the Children on a regular basis.

> c)     School Holiday access would be divided equally between the parents and cover the March and September holidays as well as the mid year and year end holidays. I provided that the parent who does not have school holiday access will be entitled to phone or video access once a day, but did not specify the timing of the call to allow more flexibility.

> d)     Overseas Travel would be permitted during the School Holiday Access. To avoid any conflict over whether one party was reasonably withholding the Children for overseas travel, I provided that the Children’s passports would be handed over together with them, at the start of school holiday access and returned when that access ended. Given this arrangement, I provided that notice of the travel itinerary, flight and accommodation only needed to be given 1 day before the travelling parent’s school holiday access begin.

## G.   MAINTENANCE FOR THE MOTHER AND CHILDREN

102    The Mother was seeking maintenance for herself, and the Children. In respect of maintenance for the Mother, I had already awarded the Mother a considerable share of the matrimonial assets. On her own evidence, the Mother had always been employed and capable of earning about $4,000.00 to $5,000.00 a month, which would cover her purported personal expenses of about $4,429.17. While she was currently working odd-jobs, I had faith in her ability to find a job, and decided not to award her maintenance.

103    As for the Children’s monthly maintenance, the Mother claimed that the Father should provide for a total of $7,849.84 of maintenance for the Children. This comprised of tables set out at Tab H of her written submissions.

104    I fixed the personal expenses of the Children at $5,000.00 a month. My computation of these expenses is set out at **Annex D**. My explanation in respect of the big ticket household items is set out below:

> a)     The Children would share the Household Expenses, which included provision for the monthly housing instalments. Here, I was guided by the decision of _UEB v UEC_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHCF 5</span> \[5\] to \[10\], where the High Court held that the Mother’s monthly instalments could be treated as part of the reasonable expenses for the Children, but the reasonableness of these instalments should be determined with reference to the cost of monthly market rental for the property. Here, I did not know what the monthly instalments were for the Mother’s current property. However, counsel accepted during the hearing that the monthly instalments were approximately $1,800.00 when the parties were living together (with 5 people including a domestic helper), so I applied a lower figure of $1,500.00 (with 4 people including a domestic helper – rounded up from $1,440.00).

> b)     The Household Expenses would also include the costs of a domestic helper, which the parties had benefited from during the marriage. A domestic helper would also help the Mother to return to the workforce.

105    With the expenses at $5,000.00 a month, I pro-rated each parent’s contribution in accordance with their gross annual income. Here, the Father had submitted to IRAS that he drew an income of about $130,129.00 in 2018 (including allowances and bonuses). Therefore I rounded down his potential income to about $130,000. The Mother’s income potential was about $50,000.00, as while her last drawn pay was $4,800 a month ($57,600 annually for 12 months), she had lost her job, and a more realistic assessment would be to review her income in prior years over IRAS 2013,2014,2015,2016,2017 where she earned an annual income of $46,689.00, $53,162.00, $49,839.00, $45,728.00 and $57,030.00 respectively – an average of about $50,489.60.

106    Applying the above income ratios, I determined that the Father would pay the Mother $3,600.00 a month for the maintenance of the Children, to be divided equally ($1,800.00 per child).

107    The maintenance would be paid on the first day of the month starting from 1 June 2019, and thereafter on the 1st day of each month into the Mother’s designated account.

## H.   COSTS

108    On the issue of costs, the Father submitted that there be no order as to costs, and the Mother submitted that she be awarded costs of $7,000.00, given that she had obtained care and control of the Children. While I had done so, to take into account my view of the Mother’s conduct and the considerable access I had given the Father, I ordered there be no order as to costs.
