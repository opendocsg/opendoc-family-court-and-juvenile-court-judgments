Family law – Family Violence – Harassment

17 September 2019

### District Judge Wong Keen Onn:

## Introduction

1       This case involves an application under SS 554/2018 by VAW (“the Complainant” or “the Mother”) against VAX “(the Respondent” or “the Father”) for a Personal Protection Order (“PPO”) for herself and the female Child of the marriage, \[B\], then 5 years of age. (hereinafter referred to as “the Child”). There was a cross application by the Father for a PPO against the Mother for the Child in SS 1334/2018.

2       At the conclusion of the trial and after hearing the evidence and submissions, I dismissed both applications. Only the Complainant Mother has appealed against my decision and I now set out my reasons for me decision in only SS 554/2018 which will supplement the brief points which I had delivered on 15 August 2019.

## Background

3       The two parties VAW and VAX were once married (on \[xx\] December 1997) with one Child of the marriage namely \[B\], now aged 7. The parties were divorced on 29 September 2016 (Final Judgment on)[^1](appears that the date of 23May 2016 in the Complainant’s affidavit is incorrect)[^2]. At the time when the application was taken out by the Complainant, the Respondent was ordered to have DSSA access to the Child and the first 3 Ordered sessions were completed but that the access under the Fourth Order has not commenced due to financial issues[^3].

## The Law

4       The relevant provision for this application is Section 65(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353). It provides that:

> “The Court may, upon satisfaction on a balance of probabilities that family violence has been committed or is likely to be committed against a family member and that it is necessary for the protection of the family member, make a protection order restraining the person against whom the order is made from using family violence against the family member.”

5       The words “family violence” and “hurt” are defined in Section 64 of the Women’s Charter. The issue in this case concerned the allegation of harassment. Thus, I have reproduced paragraph (d) below for ease of reference:

> “family violence means the commission of any of the following acts:

>> a)    …;

>> b)    …;

>> c)    …,

>> d)    Causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member,

6       First, it is settled law that a Complainant must demonstrate on a balance of probability the existence of the two limbs in section 65 before a court will issue a PPO in favour of an applicant. First, that an act of violence has been committed in the past or that there is a likelihood of its occurrence in the future. This ought to be based on the incidents that occurred prior to the filing for the application of the PPO. In _Teng Cheng Sin v Law Fay Yuen_ \[2003\] 3 SLR (R) 356 at the headnotes and \[19\] to \[21\], the High Court held that trial court was in error in taking into account the evidence of a disputed incident which occurred months after the application for a PPO was made. The High Court went on to add that that evidence should not have been allowed.

7       Second, the Complainant has to show that it is necessary for the protection of the family member that an order be made. The scope of the necessity for protection was discussed in the case of _Yue Tock Hin @ Yee Chok Him v Yee Ee Lim_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGDC 99</span>, where the Court held:

> _“… a personal protection order is not a punitive measure to punish a person for past violence but is instead an order that serves to restrain the person concerned from committing family violence in future._ _Therefore, if there will be no family violence in the future, it serves no purpose to restrain the party concerned, and it must follow that a personal protection order would not be necessary”._ _(underline mine)_

8       In this case, I would adopt an ordinary meaning of harassment. Case law had held that harassment “should be accorded a common-sense meaning” and that it would refer to “a course of conduct by a person, whether by words or action, directly or through third parties, sufficiently repetitive in nature and which he ought reasonably to know would cause, worry, emotional distress or annoyance to another person”. Harassment describes “determined conduct which is directed at persons and sufficiently repetitive in nature as would cause or is calculated to produce discomfort and/or unease and/or distress”: see _Malcomson Nicholas Hugh Bertran v Mehta Naresh Kumar_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 3 SLR(R) 379</span> at \[31\] and _Benber Dayao Yu v Jacter Singh_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 316</span> at \[33\], \[34\] (a case on section 12 of the Protection from Harassment Act (Act 14 of 2014) (“POHA”) and where the word “harassment” was not defined in the Act). As stated in section 64 of the Women’s Charter, there has to be continual harassment.

## The Complainant’s Case

9       The Mother alleged that the Father had committed family violence by adducing evidence of the following acts allegedly committed by the Father. Counsel in her submission said the incidents the Mother was relying on for PPO for the Child were:

> a.     The Father had been visiting the Child care centre almost every morning to look at the Child from early January 2018 onwards (till the date of the application)[^4];

> b.     Going to the Mother’s house to see the Child when she was not at the Centre;

> c.     At the centre, the Father had tried to get attention of the Child and the other Children there by making gestures, causing the other Children to call him a “stranger”[^5];

> d.     Following the Child as she moved around the Centre[^6];

> e.     Taking photographs of the Child[^7];

> f.     Showing the Child’s photographs to her friends (on 1 occasion)[^8]; and

> g.     Confronting the teacher Ms \[C\] on 8 March 2018[^9].

10     For her application for a PPO for herself, she alleged that the Father committed the following incidents:

> a.     The Father had been visiting the Child care centre almost every morning to look at the Child from early January 2018 onwards (till the date of the application)[^10];

> b.     Going to the Mother’s house to see the Child when she was not at the centre;

> c.     Threatening the Mother to “watch out” when he saw her at the centre[^11]; and

> d.     Making derogatory remarks about the Mother to the centre Principal[^12].

## The Respondent’s Position

11     The Father in general denied that he intended to harass the Child or the Mother. He said he only wanted to see the Child and he was upset when the teacher arranged for the Child to sit behind a partition – regarding the incident on or about 8 March 2018. As for going to the Mother’s residence, he said he only did this when he discovered that the chid did not attend Child care and he did not receive any information about what had happened to the Child. When he went to the Mother’s flat, he only stood outside to see if the Child was at home. When he was able to see the Child there, he would then leave. He explained that he had limited communication with the Mother and the Mother had not replied at all to his emails. He denied he shouted at the Child. He also denied uttering threats to the Mother and also did not sound his car horn at the Mother and Child when he drove past them after the DSSA visits.

## My Decision

12     It was necessary to understand the setting and background during which the alleged incidents took place. The events involving access to the Child and the involvement of the courts and the Ministry of Social & Family Development (“MSF”) and police in year 2017 and 2018 were generally not in dispute and the parties were all aware of this during the trial. The Father was awarded unsupervised and overnight access to the Child in the Ancillary Order of Court in 2016. Sometime in June 2016, the Mother reported to the Child Protection Services (CPS), MSF, that the Father had touched the Child inappropriately on her private parts and had “twisted the Child’s arm” on 16 June 2016. MSF filed a police report on behalf of the Mother. All these led to the application of care and protection orders in the Youth Court. On 1 July 2016, the Youth Court ordered the Child be placed under the care of the Mother for a period of 2 months and restricting the Father’s access subject to the approval of relevant MSF officer. This was followed by another Statutory Supervision Court order for another 4-month period till January 2017. On 13 January 2017, the Youth Court did granted grant any further extension of the Child protection orders as the Court felt there was no longer any significant care and protection concerns for the Child. It was not in dispute that notwithstanding the discharge of the care and protection order, the Mother continued to refuse the Defendant Father access to the Child as per the Ancillary Order[^13]. At the material time in 2018, the Father was required to undergo supervised visitation for access to the Child in view of the sexual allegation investigations and the Mother’s application to vary the access[^14].

13     For the application for PPO for the Child, both parties relied on what they claimed to be the Child’s feelings and responses given to the parents, the teacher Ms \[C\] and the principal. Both Ms \[C\] and Ms \[D\] were not called as witnesses and their letters were out of court statements. They were not available for cross examination. These statements were hearsay evidence. Hence I had to be very careful to assess their emails and letters. The Child was also not called as a witness.

14     All the evidence that the Child’s feelings came from the parties. I however have serious reservations as to whether the Child had told the truth or whether the Mother had rightly told the truth in the allegations. There was evidence (un-contradicted) led that in 2016, the Child had told the Mother that the Father had committed outrage of modesty on her. That led to the suspension of the access order by the Court and MSF CPS was called in to investigate. After investigating, the matter was closed and CPS cease their involvement[^15]. Also police reports were made and after completion of the police investigations, the police also closed the matter on 21 August 2018, some 2 years later (see (Singapore Police Force (“SPF”) letter dated 15 January 2019) (refer to Police report dated 11 March 2018 and dated 21 August 2018).

15     Second, the Child had told two contradictory versions of an incident she encountered on 15 June 2016 regarding an “arm twisting” incident. On both occasions, the Mother accompanied the Child to see the doctors at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (“KKH”). The Father was not present. So there could not be any possible influence on the Child by the Father. At first the Child told Dr \[E\] that she “injured her right arm when she fell down while playing”. Although “_the Child was presented to CE with upper limb pain, on evaluation at CE_ _there was no more pain and there was a full range of movement of the upper limb__. The vital signs were stable and examination of the rest of the body was unremarkable. Roentgenogram examination of the right elbow and right elbow and right wrist was unremarkable. The patient was discharged._ _Medical leave and analgesia were offered but declined by the Mother_” (Medical Report dated 1 July 2016 by Dr \[F\])[^16]. The Mother also made a police report. One week after the first medical examination, the Mother went with the Child to make an allegation to doctor Dr \[G\] that “it was the Father who pulled her right arm”. The medical examination “_showed there was no symptoms at the time of the presentation_ (Medical Report dated 19 October 2016 by Dr \[F\])[^17]. There was no satisfactory explanation proffered by the Mother for this contradictory evidence. I also noted that all the police investigations into the complaints filed by the Mother against the Father have all been completed and the police have taken no further action and closed all the cases (see SPF letters dated 21 August 2018, 26 January 2018, 14 October 2016)[^18]. There is little merit in the allegations and it lends weight to the assessment that there was insufficient basis and evidence to support all these allegations. Having assessed the evidence on allegations of the Child being scared or “traumatised” in the presence of the Father and that the Child was at times sitting on a chair separately, I came to the conclusion that what the Child apparently told the Mother and the teachers about being uncomfortable with the Father’s presence was not credible and what she had allegedly “conveyed” to them was highly unreliable.

16     I also did not find the Mother to be a reliable witness. She gave inconsistent evidence and often changed her mind on the material facts. For instance, she first said she was not in the vicinity of the school on 9 March 2018 but then she contradicted herself and change her version as shown below[^19]:

>   
| 

_Q_

 | 

_So, just to check with you. On the 8th of March, you handed over \[Bto the School Teacher, Ms \[C\]’ and then you were not at the vicinity at all, right?_

 |
| 

_A_

 | 

_Yes._

 |
| 

_Q_

 | 

_And on the 9th of March, were you at the vicinity also? The next day which is on a Thursday?_

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_So---sorry. May I have your answer? Your answer was, “Yes”?_

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_Yes._

 |
| 

_Court:_

_“Yes” meaning what? At the vicinity or not in vicinity?_

_Court:_

 | 

_Yah, ask that 2nd question again._

 |
| 

_Q_

 | 

_On the 9th of March, were you present at the school? Or were you---_

 |
| 

_VAX:_

 | 

_Yah, okay._

 |
| 

 | 

_… …_

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_So, you’re just asking whether on 9th of March, she was---_

 |
| 

_VAX:_

 | 

_She---I just wanted to know whether she was at the school or---_

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_Okay._

 |

_VAX:_

_she was not present in school._

 |
| 

_Court:_

_Yah. Maybe on that---on that, yes._

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

**_I think I’m present---I was present at school_** _._

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_Can you think carefully first? Because don’t---you know? You---you want to look at your affidavits, I’ll let you look at your affidavits, alright? Just look at your affidavits and just check._

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

**_Yes, I was at school_** _._

 |
| 

_VAX:_

 | 

_Sir, can I---can I stop with this or---because---_

 |
| 

 | 

_… …_

 |
| 

_VAX:_

 | 

_We covered but it was---because I want to just clarify that she actually was not present at the school on the 9th of March._

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_But she says she is._

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_Sir---_

 |
| 

_VAX:_

 | 

_She is---she is---_

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_may I---can I?_

 |

_That’s her answer._

_Sir, can I, sorry, go and check my phone? If I’m not present, I will---_

_No._

_to be accurate. Don’t worry, Witness. Is it okay? She check her phone just confirm---I mean, it’s just confirming whether she was there or not there, that’s all._

 |
| 

_VAX:_

 | 

_Okay._

_Court:_

_You---you---you went to co---school on the 9th---_

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

**_Yes_** _._

 |

  
  

She also could not remember the date when the alleged “shouting about a stranger “by the Children had made the Child upset. She also gave contradictory versions as to how the principal knew the Respondent was the Father.[^20]

>   
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_Yes, page 4 paragraph C the---the sentence start with “The other Children in school have been---have also been asking \[B\] if the strange man was her Father.” My question to clarify is that, did you hear it from the Children or you heard from someone else? I mean how do you know about it; you know?_

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_I have heard the Children, uh, they asked \[B\]. Uh, there’s other sit there they will just shout, “Ba, there’s a stranger in the window.”_

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_Is it once only or what? What you’re talking about?_

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_It’s not once._

 |
| 

 | 

_... …_

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_Okay. So, when did these more than one occasions took place?_

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_I don’t know the date, Sir._

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_Is it before you came to file a PP---for PPO or it happened---_

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_Before._

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_If you don’t know the date, why are you so sure that it’s before?_

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_I know it happened before the PPO, Sir._

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_No, why do you answer it just now?_

 |
| 

 | 

_… …_

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_Because, after some time, the principal talked to the Children already._

 |
| 

 | 

_… …_

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_I don’t know the exact date; I know the timeframe._

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_So, what’s the timeframe then?_

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_Before the PPO itself the principal already explained to the Children. So, they know. So, they---they are---they don’t---means that what---_

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_Does the teachers and the principal know at that time that there will---you know, VAX is the Father?_

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_Yes._

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_So, did anybody do any---correct them that time, that’s her Father?_

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_Why would they do that, Sir? Uh, all the parents will come along._

 |
| 

 | 

_... …_

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_No, there are nobody say that which---saying that, look---and my---my point is that, look, from day 1 they know who that Father is, correct?_

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_Yes._

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_Who doesn’t know? The teacher don’t know, is it?_

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_They know._

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_They all know?_

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_When he start appearing I have to inform the school._

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_So, when? When did they know that VAX is the Father?_

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_January, early January when he started to appear I have to inform the school who is the person. He himself introduced himself to the teachers and principal._

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_So, you tell or he himself tell?_

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_He also got to say---because he send it all the emails and introduced himself to the principal._

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_So who actually told them? You or her---him?_

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_Both of us._

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_Same time?_

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_I don’t know. When the principal asked me who is that person then I have to let her know._

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_Yah, then of course the principal doesn’t know. Our main point is that how does the principal know that VAX is the Father?_

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_Because when he appeared there---_

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_Did---you are the one who tell your principal to say that, look, that one is my---my ex-husband or whatever he is, you know?_

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_Yah, when I saw him I---I went over and tell her._

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_No, I’m asking you, did you tell because otherwise how would a principal know that this person is the Father?_

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_I told the principal._

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_So, you are the one who told?_

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_Yes._

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_Then why do you say that he---_

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_He also make contact with her._

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_he sent letters---email, correct?_

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_He went personally and told her also._

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_You know of that?_

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_Yes, she told me._

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_Then why is it that for---for her to ask who’s this person? You are contradicting yourself._

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_No, Sir, I told her that after that he also went down and told---introduced himself to her. So, she said, “He came and introduced himself to me.” That’s why I know that he introduced._

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_That’s why I asked you whether you tell your principal or he tell, you couldn’t answer._

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_Okay, I’m---the first one._

 |
| 

 | 

_... …_

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_Mmm hmm._

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_But if he asked you, that is different---principal doesn’t know._

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_I’m the one who first tell it to her then we appear that they are in quickly to there, uh---_

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_And why---then if that’s the case why is it that you---the principal say, look, he also told me. That’s what you say like, when I mentioned you also say that’s it. Wha---why are you saying that?_

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_Can you, Sir, elaborate that he also went and---_

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_No, do you say is---_

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_introduced---_

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_don’t you think it’s inconsistent? You say that, look, I’ll still wait there and then the principal say, look, the person has also told me that. So, VAX told the principal first, correct?_

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_Hmm._

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_‘Cause how---how could a principal tell you on the spot that, look, you know, he also told me that. Which version would you want to accept as correct? You didn’t answer the question, now I’m---I’ll just move on. Okay, can you go down to the next line? \[B\] even told the principal, it should---like after. When did it happen?_

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_Early part of January. I think it’s, uh, you want the day there, Sir?_

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_It’s up to you. I leave it you, it’s your evidence. ‘Cause every line you don’t put a time, I do not know why it happened. So, I’m going to through every line and it has---gave me the dates whatever it is, I just take whatever it is, you know? So, it says “early part of January” right?_

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_Yes._

 |

  
  

The Mother also was evasive in the witness stand when she was asked to state when she made the police report upon the Father appearing at the nursery window. Even though she was asked a few times on this, she could not provide a satisfactory answer[^21]:

>   
| 

_Q_

 | 

_You written in the sentence, go by line. Line 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. “VAX appears at my nursery window and abused us and threatens me.” I don’t see any police report on that. If you say that I’ve been doing that continuously this is---why did you say continuously?_

 |
| 

_A_

 | 

_Um---_

 |
| 

_Q_

 | 

_Why didn’t you do police reports? Multiple police reports. You should have done that._

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_Sorry, what’s the question? Can you just rephrase it?_

 |
| 

_Q_

 | 

_The question was if---if you say that VAX appears---appears at my nursery window and abused us and threatens me, did---did you do a police report and can I see the police report? Do you have a police report?_

 |
| 

_A_

 | 

**_I have to check whether I made a police report because I remember making a police report_** _._

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_Madam, Madam. How many months has passed since the filling of the affidavit and the complaint? Are you saying that now it’s still on---to check? Are you saying that there are other reports, was it? Are you making a statement to that effect?_

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

**_Yes, Sir. I think, I---I would like to check also_** _._

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_No, I ask you whether, are you saying that you made a police report or didn’t? He is asking, have you made a police report. So, yes or no?_

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_Yes. Yes._

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_You say, yes?_

 |
| 

_Q_

 | 

**_Then do you recall, when was the date or is it every day you wouldn’t do a report_** _?_

 |
|

17     I did not find that the acts of the Father of going to the Child care or nursery daily to be a form of harassment as he was allowed by the centre’s principal to go there as long as he left by 9.00 am. He was not the only parent who did that as the photographs did show other parents also staying or “hanging around” around the Child care centre between 8.30 am to 9.00 am after their Child was already in the centre. He complied with the time limits after this was raised to him on 1 March 2018[^22]. I also find that the act of the Father in trying have eye contact or making hand signs was not as a form of harassment as there was no evidence that the Child suffered harassment. The Mother raised this point that the Child told Ms \[C\] and Ms \[D\] about feeling uncomfortable. However, their statements were hearsay as they were made out of court. On the other hand, the Father gave evidence that on occasions the Child made receptive signs towards him. I accepted the evidence of the Father that he did not shout at the Child. I did not find the sharing of the photos and taking of photos to be sufficient acts of harassment as none of the teachers in the school gave evidence on this. As for the altercation on 8 March 2018, I prefer the evidence of the Father. I did not accept the version of the teachers (in emails) as they were not present in court to testify on their version. As for the Mother’s testimony on the incident, it is hearsay as she was not present at the scene and her version in court was based on what was told to her by the principal and the teacher (who were not witnesses). Although the Child had mild fever, there was no corroborative evidence that the Child fell ill because of the incident. The medical certificate did not disclose what caused the Child to fall ill. I also rejected the teacher’s e-mails that claimed the Child fell ill as a result of the incident involving the Father because it was hearsay evidence and the evidence was not from a qualified medical practitioner or a psychiatrist. I also note that counsel for the Mother had at the trial withdrawn most of paragraph 7 (g) at page 5 of the Complainant’s affidavit containing the “teacher’s narration of incident and the teacher’s opinion”. That claim was only the Mother’s conjecture.

18     In any event, I also find that since 2019, the Child had moved on to Primary 1 in a different school and no longer in nursery and the Mother was in another school and there was no evidence of further incidents that the Father had committed any act that amounted to harassment. With the new change of circumstances, the Father could no longer visit the Child in primary school (unlike when the Child was in Child care) and he had not been doing this. With regard to the second limb in section 64 of the Women’s Charter, I also was of the view that it was not necessary to issue a PPO.

19     I therefore was of the view that the incidents did not amount to continual harassment and therefore constitute family violence and the Mother had not shown on a balance of probability that the Father had committed family violence on the Child. I therefore dismiss the Mother’s application for PPO for the Child.

20     As for the allegations of harassment against the Mother (SS 554/2018), I was of the view that the incidents in totality did not meet the requirement of continual harassment. I find the Respondent to be a more credible witness. The Complainant was evasive in her testimony and was vague at times on material aspects of her allegations as shown above. I accepted the Respondent’s evidence that he did not communicate and did not threaten the Mother to “watch out” when he saw her at the centre or on the rare occasions outside her flat. As for the letter to the principal, I accepted the Father’s version that it was his explanation to the principal not to accept what the Mother had said to be true (especially when the Mother was also an employed staff at the Child care centre) as he had been subjected to investigations arising from her complaints and they were finally found not to be substantiated and the cases were closed. This was supported by letter from the Police closing all the investigation cases against him. I note the Father was in his email dated 5 March 2018 basically “urging the teachers not to get involved in this mess he had with the Mother” and asking “them to be neutral”. I had considered this against the backdrop that parties’ relationship had been very acrimonious in relation to parenting with the Child where the Mother had admitted in Court that she had been unilaterally denying the Father access to the Child despite a Court Order allowing unsupervised access to the Father, at least in year 2016 and since February 2019 onwards.

21     I therefore dismissed summons SS 554/2018. As the Complainant was legally aided, I did not make any order as to costs.

[^1]: From the E-Lit system (which the Court will take judicial notice), Interim Judgment was on 17 November 2015. Final Judgment granted on 29 September 216. The Mother was granted care and control of the Child on 23 May 2016 (Ancillary Matters (“AM) Order ORC \[xxx\]/2016 dated 23 May 2016) with access given to the Father. It appears that the 23 May 2016 is the AM Order date.
