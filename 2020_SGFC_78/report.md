Variation of maintenance

Variation of access

16 September 2020

### District Judge Nicole Loh:

## Introduction

1       This is an application filed by the Defendant father (“the Father”) to vary the maintenance and access orders in relation to the child of the marriage (“the Child”) who is currently 7 years old.

2       Parties were previously married and had reached a consent order on their divorce and the ancillary matters. This was then granted by way of an Interim Judgment dated 12 April 2017.

3       Subsequently, the access orders in the Interim Judgment were varied on 20 February 2019 (“Access Order”) pursuant to an application filed by the Father.

4       The Father filed the current application on 4 May 2020 to vary the existing maintenance orders and access orders found in both the Interim Judgment and the Access Order.

## Facts

###    Background to the dispute

5       The orders in the Interim Judgment that are the subject matter of the application are the following:

> (a)     That the Plaintiff mother (“the Mother”) shall be at liberty to relocate out of Singapore with the Child to Brisbane, Australia or Gold Coast, Australia, on or after 30 July 2018, upon giving the Defendant 3 month’s prior notice.

> (b)     If the Mother intends to relocate out of Singapore to any other destination other than Brisbane, Australia or Gold Coast, Australia, or if the relocation out of Singapore is prior to 30 July 2018, then the Mother shall obtain the Father’s consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, or obtain an Order of Court.

> (c)     The Father shall pay a sum of S$1,700 per month to the Mother for the maintenance of the Child. The Father shall continue to bear the Child’s school fees less any rebates which the Mother may receive.

6       The Access orders provided extensive orders for access set out in 3 stages. Stage 1 called for the Father to undergo urine and drug tests as well as to attend an anger management counselling programme. This has been complied with by the Father and therefore the access orders under Stage 2 and 3 of the Access orders are the ones in force. The following are the orders in the Access Order that is the subject matter of this application:

> (a)     The Father will have weekly overnight access from Friday 5:30pm (or when the Child finishes school for the day, whichever is earlier) to Saturday 8:00pm three times a month;

> (b)     The Father is to ensure that his mother and/or father to be present for each overseas trip with the Child;

> (c)     The Father shall be granted access to the Child for long school holidays (i.e., June and December school holidays, or holiday exceeding two weeks) as follows:-

>> (i)       The first week on even years; and

>> (ii)       The last week on odd years.

> (d)     Save for Christmas and Good Friday holidays which were separately provided for, the Father shall have access to the Child from 9:00am to 8:00pm on alternate public holidays.

> (e)     In the event the Father is not able to exercise his access in the event that the Mother is travelling with the Child, the Father shall be entitled to make-up access.

> (f)     Unless mutually agreed, all pick-up and drop-off for the Father’s access shall take place at the Mother’s residence either at the guardhouse or the lobby.

## The parties’ cases

7       The Father’s application to vary the maintenance order was based on his claim that there is a material change in his circumstances. Since the Interim Judgment was granted, the Father claims he had lost his employment and his new employment no longer provided him with any education subsidy to pay for the Child’s school fees. He has subsequently further lost this new employment.

8       The Father applied to vary the maintenance orders to clarify the existing orders and also sought further orders that would enable him to have more access to the Child effectively.

9       The Mother objected to the Father’s application and claims that the Father has not proven he has lost his employment. She also rejects any changes to the Access Order as it had been set out comprehensively and the proposed variations sought are unnecessary and/or not in the Child’s best interest.

## Issues to be determined

10     The issues to be determined are as follows:

> (a)     Whether the Father’s terms of employment have materially changed since the Interim Judgment;

> (b)     Whether there is any necessity to vary the Access Orders in the best interest of the Child.

## Issue 1: Variation of maintenance

11     The Father applied to suspend the monthly maintenance of $1700 and his payment of the Child’s school fees for 6 months or until he finds employment, whichever is the earlier. Thereafter, he shall pay $750 per month as maintenance and 50% of the Child’s school fees.

12     It is undisputed that when the Interim Judgment order was made, the Father was employed and earning a monthly income of 19,950 to $20,549. His employers \[Company A\] also fully paid for the Child’s education.

13     The Father claimed that he was terminated in February 2019 and placed on garden leave ending on 13 April 2019. Subsequently, he obtained new employment with \[Company B\] on 15 April 2019. He received a salary of $20,300 but \[Company B\] did not pay for the Child’s education. He claimed therefore he was out of pocket for the Child’s expenses. He claimed he was terminated from employment by \[Company B\] on or about 28 November 2019 due to a change in the conditions of the market.

14     The Mother objected to the reduction of maintenance and submits that the Father’s change of employment in February 2019 is likely a self-induced change. She also submits that the employment terms with Company B has not been fully declared by the Father and there is no evidence of his termination of employment.

15     As this was an application filed by the Father who is asserting the change of circumstances, the burden of proof lies on him. However, the Father has failed to discharge this burden. The Father has provided the following supporting documents:

> (a)     Employment contract with Company A, with an appendix;

> (b)     Letter confirming termination of employment from Company A; and

> (c)     Employment contract with Company B, without an appendix.

16     The Father failed to provide any supporting documents of the termination of his employment with Company B. This was a persistent failure to provide despite the Mother had in her reply affidavit pointed out to the fact that there is nothing in support his claim and in the Written Submissions pointing out the lack of evidence. The Father did not file any reply affidavit or to address this by providing the supporting documents at the trial. Even during the trial, the Mother’s counsel repeatedly requested for the Father to point to the supporting documents in his affidavit to prove his termination of employment. The Father’s reply on the stand was to repeatedly claim that his documents are already provided and clear without specifically referring to his affidavit. I had to directly ask the Father to refer to his affidavit to point out any document on termination before he admitted he did not have the affidavits before him (although he had at the beginning of the trial confirmed they were in front of him) and he then claimed to have just realised that he did _not_ include any documents to show the termination of his employment.

17     As this evidence went to the root of his application for variation of maintenance, I directed the Father to file a further affidavit limited to exhibiting this document. In view of the lateness in the production of the crucial supporting evidence, I repeatedly stressed to the Father during the trial that he was being given a last chance to provide this document in an affidavit. However, despite all chances available to the Father to provide his supporting evidence (in his supporting affidavit; after reading the Mother’s affidavit; after reading the Mother’s written submissions which were served 7 days’ prior to the hearing; pursuant to specific directions given at trial), this was still not done. He instead submitted evidence by adding it to his written submissions which had been relied upon during the trial. Written submissions are not meant for the purpose of admitting new evidence and are not sworn by a deponent before a Commissioner for Oaths. The Father had already been given a final chance by me in view of the fact that he was a litigant in person even though he is not one who is handicapped in the legal process due to language difficulty or lack of access to technology. The Mother would already have suffered prejudice in having potential new evidence provided after a hearing which she would not be able to address. I see no reason to grant the Father further indulgences in the manner and timeframe for him to provide his evidence. I therefore disregarded the new evidence in his Written Submissions.

18     The importance of the documentary evidence being in an affidavit is also due to the fact that as pointed out by the Mother’s counsel, the respective employment contracts with Company A and Company B were almost word for word identical, strongly suggesting a link between the 2 employments. The terms of employment were also very similar (since the contracts were almost identical) save for the employer’s payment of the Child’s school expenses. However, this benefit was found only in the Appendix of the employment contract with Company A. Although the employment contract with Company B also refers to an appendix, this was not provided. Company B also extended a large loan to the Father almost immediately upon employment which adds credence to the suggestion that the Father has a personal relationship with the owner of Company B. Therefore, even the documents that were provided by the Father on affidavit raised questions about the true circumstances of his employment with Company B and any further evidence ought to be made on oath.

19     I therefore dismissed the application to vary maintenance since there was no evidence of his loss of employment.

## Issue 2: Variation of access

20     The Father applied to vary the access orders in various manners, primarily due to the general basis that he has been exercising access to the Child and his relationship with the Child is closer and he would like to improve the access orders to further safeguard/improve the relationship with the Child.

### Removal of right for Mother to relocate with Child to Brisbane or Gold Coast

21     The existing order calls for the Mother to seek the consent of the Father if she wishes to relocate from Singapore, save for Brisbane or Gold Coast. The reason for the special right of the Mother to relocate to these 2 places was explained by the Mother’s counsel in that the parties, who are Australians, came from these places. Even in the Interim Judgment, it was specifically mentioned that the parties are Australians and are only in Singapore for work.

22     The Father’s reason for applying to vary this to require the Mother to seek his consent even if she is relocating to Brisbane or Gold Coast was because she has remarried to a man who is based in Kuala Lumpur and he believes there is a possibility that she will relocate.

23     The existing order was a consent order reached between both parties by agreement. Therefore quite clearly, parties had already applied their minds on the issue of relocation and were of the common view that Brisbane and Gold Coast are special destinations in which the Mother and Child can relocate to without needing the consent from the Father. The fact that Father’s access to the Child will definitely be affected would have been quite apparent whether then or now and cannot be something new that was not considered earlier. The fact that the Mother and Child may relocate to Brisbane or Gold Coast with an additional person, has no additional direct impact on the Father. In any event, the Mother has stated there are no plans for relocation at all at this point in time. I see no reason to vary the order.

### Overnight weekly access to start from Friday 5:30pm or after school, whichever is earlier, instead of later and for pick up from school directly

24     The existing order is for weekly access to start from Friday 5:30pm or after school, whichever is later.

25     The Father claims the order was extracted wrongly and the Judge had ordered and intended that access to start at the earlier event. This was denied by the Mother.

26     I had the benefit of checking the earlier Judge’s minutes and the Order was extracted as per the Judge’s minuted orders. In fact, it did not make sense for access to start based on an earlier event as it would mean that if the Child finished school at 6pm, access would start at 5:30pm. Notwithstanding this, I considered if it would be in the interest of the Child to adjust the timing.

27     The effect of the current order was that access starts at 5:30pm even though the Child finished school earlier. The Mother explained that after school, it takes some time for the Child to return home and to prepare to meet the Father for the overnight access. The Father claimed he can pick the Child directly from school.

28     I did not vary the access orders to allow for the Father to pick the Child directly from school for access to start earlier than at 5:30pm. I accepted that the Child should be given a chance to return home to freshen up and change out of his school clothes before transitioning to a different household. Furthermore, the Father has a tendency to be late (ranging from 20 minutes to 2 hour 15 minutes) for pick up and handover and has on one occasion even missed picking up the Child entirely. The effect of this is mitigated by the fact that the Child is still at the relative comfort of his home compound in the company of either the domestic helper or the Mother. This will be very different if the Child is waiting by himself to be picked up from school.

### To alternate handover

29     The current order calls for the Father to pick up and return the Child for access. He applied that this be alternated between the Mother and himself because he does not have his own transport and has to use public transport, which is costly.

30     I declined to vary this order. I would assume that the Father is well able to plan his own transportation and if he has found that traffic conditions or supply of public transportation is less than conducive at a certain time of the day, then it is for him to make earlier arrangements to be punctual or find alternative modes of transportation which are more cost effective. It does not mean therefore the Mother should now take over half of handovers.

### For access during all school holidays, to allow overseas access without the Father’s parents

31     The Father currently has access during long school holidays (i.e. any school holiday exceeding 2 weeks). It was also ordered that his father and/or mother is to be present during overseas access. These were access orders which were in force in Stage 3, i.e. 1 year after the Access Order was made.

32     He asks for access during all alternate school holidays and to remove the requirement for his parent to be present during his overseas access. The basis for his application is that access is going on well and he would like to have more school holiday access and there is no need to have his parents present during overseas access, especially in view of their age.

33     I did not vary the order as these orders were put in place on 20 February 2019 after extensive hearing after which the Judge had put into place comprehensive access to be developed in 3 stages. As at the hearing before me, the school holiday access ordered as per Stage 3 were in place for about 4 months. The Father has yet to exercise any overseas access. I did not see sufficient evidence to convince me that the detailed access orders put in place by the previous Judge ought to be varied at this point in time.

### Make up access

34     The Father had a right to make-up access if he was unable to exercise his access if the Mother was travelling with the Child. The Father sought to vary this order to state that the Mother’s staycation or excursions with the Child in Singapore shall not be considered as travelling for the purposes of this order.

35     This was sparked off by an incident where the Mother had notified the Father that she was going to travel with the Child and they then made arrangements for make-up access as per the Order. Subsequently, the Father realised that she did not travel with the Child. The Mother explained that her initial plan for an overseas trip was changed to a staycation but as parties continued with the arrangement of the make-up access as agreed, there was no issue.

36     I did not vary the order as the above dispute seemed to be a one-off dispute. In any event, there was make-up access arranged for the Father. Furthermore, even if not explicitly provided for in the order, parties are at liberty to re-arrange access terms by agreement.

37     The Father also wanted to have make up access if his public holiday access fell on his normal weekly access. He explained that on one occasion when a public holiday coincided with his Saturday access, the Saturday should have been treated as his weekly access and he should therefore have the following public holiday or make-up holiday access.

38     I disagree with the Father’s interpretation of access orders. Special access orders will supersede any regular access orders. When he does not have access to the Child ordinarily but it is his turn for public holiday access, then he shall have that public holiday access because that special access superseded the weekly access orders, which would otherwise have disentitled him to any access on that day. Similarly, if the Mother has a public holiday access falling on a day which is not the Father’s day of access, she is not entitled to reduce his regular access by a day.

## Conclusion

39     Therefore the Father’s application was largely dismissed as he failed to prove the material change in circumstances he alleged to vary the maintenance and his application for a variation of the comprehensive access orders put in place just slightly more than a year was necessary or in the best interest of the child.
