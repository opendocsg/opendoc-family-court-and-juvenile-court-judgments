Family Law – Family Violence – Section 65 Women’s Charter

6 March 2019

### District Judge Lo Wai Ping:

## Introduction

1       This case concerned 3 applications for personal protection orders. The complainant-mother (“**Complainant**”) had applied for a personal protection order (“**PPO**”) for herself against her husband, the respondent (“**Respondent**”). She had also applied for PPOs against the Respondent on behalf of her 2 daughters. At the time of her application, her first daughter (“**A**”) was 11 years old and her second daughter (“**B**”) was 3 years old (together, the “**Children**”).

2       At the end of the hearing, I granted the Complainant’s application for a PPO for herself but dismissed her applications for PPOs made on behalf of the Children. She has appealed against my dismissals and these are my grounds of decision only in respect of the dismissals.

## Background

3       The parties have been married for 14 years since 2004. They were living together with the Children in a flat in Jurong (“**Flat**”) before the Complainant left the Flat with the Children on 15 February 2018. The Respondent is employed as a project director; the Complainant is a homemaker.

4       On 19 February 2018, the Complainant filed a complaint against the Respondent (“the **Complaint**”) seeking PPOs for herself and the Children under section 65 of the Women’s Charter. Pursuant to the Complaint, the summons in SS 395/2018 was issued against the Respondent.

5       At the time of the hearing, the Complainant and the Children were still living apart from the Respondent. They were staying in a shelter whilst the Respondent continued to live in the Flat.

6       Before the matter came for hearing before me in June 2018, parties filed and exchanged the following on 18 May 2018 in court:

(a)     The Complainant’s statement and documents (collectively, Exhibit C1); and

(b)     The Respondent’s affidavit evidence in chief affirmed on 17 May 2018 (Exhibit R1).

7       At the hearing, only the Complainant and Respondent gave evidence. I will deal first with the PPO application for A and my reasons for dismissing it.

## PPO application for A

#### The Complainant’s case for A

8       In respect of A, the Complainant had made only the following allegation in her Complaint of 19 February 2018 under the part titled “Past incidents of Family Violence”:

_“…_ **_\[Respondent\] wants to sleep naked. So once when \[A\] saw this in the middle of the night. She complained to me “Mama, pls ask papa to wear dress properly”._** _He always wants to do”_

Nothing was however mentioned at all about the above allegation in her statement and documents (Exhibit C1) filed on 18 May 2018 and served on the Respondent prior to the hearing.

9       Notwithstanding, at the hearing, she was asked why she had filed a PPO application for A and the Complainant gave 2 reasons during her oral evidence in chief. Her first reason was this:

_“I will talk about my elder daughter. His attitude towards my elder daughter is that he takes care --- takes good care for her no doubt but_ **_at times, his activities are wrong like at night, he sleeps naked. At night, we all sleep together_** _and_ **_she upon seeing this, had ever once mentioned to me for me to tell papa to sleep properly.”_** _[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)_

10     The Complainant later clarified that although “_all of the time he is dressed_” when he (the Respondent) goes to bed, but “_in the middle of the night, his dressing goes off, and that is because he uses the night dress_…”.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) Subsequently, the Complainant also clarified that there were various ways the Respondent dressed to go to bed. If he was dressed in a single long piece of prayer dress, then in the middle of the night, it would become “in such a way that his bottom is exposed”.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3) And according to the Complainant, A had seen her father’s lower half in this ‘uncovered’ state in the middle of the night (because she wakes up to go to the toilet[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4)) and A had felt _disgusted_ with the way her father slept.

11     The Complainant’s second reason for the PPO application for A was because of the Respondent’s conduct in “attempting to kiss” the Complainant in front of A. According to the Complainant, A had found this unacceptable and was _disgusted_ by it. The Complainant’s oral evidence in chief on this part is set out below:[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5)

#### The Respondent’s Position

12     The Respondent denied that he had committed any family violence against either of the Children. He maintained that he was a good father to the Children and that the allegations made by the Complainant against him were all false and baseless.

13     In brief, his position was that he had had recent family disputes with the Complainant especially disputes due to the Complainant’s close friendship with a female friend, **M**. According to the Respondent, M came over daily to the Flat and the Complainant would spend a vast majority of her time with M. M would also often interfere with his internal family matters by negatively influencing the Complainant. As he did not approve of their relationship, this soon became the ‘source and trigger of many arguments” between the Complainant and him. The Respondent believed that M had been instrumental in influencing the Complainant to file the PPO applications against him despite the fact that he had not committed any family violence against the Children.

14     It was noted that the Complainant did not deny that she and the Respondent had many disputes over her friendship with M. She had got to know M in 2013. M lived nearby and visited her _daily_ at her Flat. According to the Complainant, the Respondent was on good terms with M at first. But, subsequently, he did not want M to come to the Flat. He also did not want the Complainant to go out with M or have a relationship with her. However, the Complainant disagreed and continued to maintain her friendship with M. She met M outside and went also to M’s home. She and M would also organise sessions for ladies living near their blocks. At these sessions, M would be giving motivational talks for half an hour and the rest of the time would be spent on yoga. These sessions were good for helping women to de-stress when there were family problems. The Complainant agreed that she had attended these sessions despite the Respondent telling her not to socialize with M.

## Reasons for dismissal of A’s PPO application

#### The Law

15     The relevant provisions are sections 64 and 65 of the Women’s Charter (“**the Act**”). Section 65 (1) of the Act provides that the court may, upon satisfaction on a balance of probabilities,

(a)     that family violence has been committed or is likely to be committed against a family member, _and_

(b)     that it is necessary for the protection of the family member,

make a protection order restraining the person against whom the order is made from using family violence against the family member.

16     Section 64 of the Charter further defines the terms “family violence” and “hurt” as having the following meanings:

“_“_**_family violence_**_” means the commission of any of the following acts:_

(_a_)     _wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;_

(_b_)     _causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;_

(_c_)     _wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his will; or_

(_d_)     _causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member_,

_but does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age;_

_“_ **_hurt_** _” means bodily pain, disease or infirmity;”_

17     The burden was on the Complainant to prove to the Court, on a balance of probabilities, that family violence had been committed (or was likely to be committed) by the Respondent against A. This was the first limb set out in section 65(1) of the Act.

#### Findings

18     As regards the first reason provided by the Complainant (see paragraphs 9 and 10 above), I noted that the Complainant had acknowledged during cross-examination that the Respondent did not always sleep in the master bedroom (“**Master Bedroom**”) with her and the Children at night. She agreed that in a week, half of the time he would in fact be sleeping in the other bedroom (“**Common Bedroom**”) and he would sleep there when he had work to do. The Complainant also agreed that even when the whole family slept together in the Master Bedroom, the Children also did not sleep with the Respondent on the same bed. There were in fact 2 beds in the Master Bedroom (a queen-sized bed and a single bed) and the Respondent always slept alone on the single bed whilst she and the Children shared the queen-sized bed. It was also not disputed that the sleeping arrangements on the queen-sized bed were such that A would always be sleeping on the side nearest the window and the toilet (that is, the side furthest away from the Respondent’s bed).[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6) Finally, the Complainant also agreed that when they slept, all the lights in the room would be switched off and the room would be dark. In summary, it was therefore the Complainant’s evidence that it was in this context that when A visited the toilet at night once in a while (the toilet being near her bed) that A had happened sometimes to see the Respondent’s exposed naked lower half whilst he was asleep in his bed at the other side of room.[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7)

19     I noted that the Complainant also agreed that the Respondent always went to bed dressed. But, it was in the middle of the night and whilst he was sleeping that his sleepwear (prayer dress) would sometimes ride up, thereby exposing his naked lower half.

20     Next, I noted that whilst the Complainant had stated during cross-examination that A had complained to her “many times” about such sightings of her father’s naked lower half at night in the abovementioned context, this was inconsistent with what she had stated originally in her Complaint and also in her oral evidence in chief which was that A had mentioned to her only _once_ about asking her father to dress properly (see paragraphs 8 and 9 above).

21     Further, as mentioned earlier, the Complainant had not even mentioned anything about this allegation in her 2-page type-written statement (Exhibit C1) filed in May 2018 prior to the hearing.

22     As for the Complainant’s second reason for the PPO (set out in paragraph 11 above), she also gave a different version when she was cross-examined on it. She now alleged that the Respondent would kiss her forcefully and this was done during the times when they were having quarrels and fights, and sometimes, when these “forceful kissing” episodes took place before A, A “couldn’t accept it” or she “may not like it”.[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8) And, A was even more _disgusted_ when her father allegedly told her to observe and learn as she would have to make her husband happy next time.

23     When asked for the reason why the Respondent would kiss her during their quarrels or fights, the Complainant said that this was in order “to settle down things faster”.[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9) And when she was asked to describe the Respondent’s actions during these episodes, her evidence was this: He would push her hands and then try to kiss her; or he would hold her hands, push to the bed or to the wall and then kiss her.[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10) But, the Complainant explained that if the Children were present, she would _not_ consent to the kissing and would try to release herself from the Respondent and move away to another place.[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11)

24     The Complainant testified that a PPO was necessary for A as she felt that A had been emotionally affected by what A had _seen_ of her father, that is, (a) his (sometimes) exposed lower half at night whilst he was sleeping (if his night dress should happen to ride up and expose his naked lower half), and (b) his forceful kissing of the Complainant before A during a quarrel/fight (between him and the Complainant). When she was asked to explain further about how A had been emotionally affected, the Complainant stated that A’s future would be affected as A’s concept of marriage and men were now not good as a result. Other than the Complainant’s evidence as set out above, there was no other evidence before the Court for the PPO application.

25     On the other hand, I noted that the Complainant agreed under cross-examination that the Respondent took good care of A.[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12) There was no allegation that the Respondent had been in any way physically violent or aggressive towards A, or that he had done any act against A which had caused hurt or placed A in fear of hurt (the term “hurt” having the meaning as defined in section 64 of the Act).

26     Given the Complainant’s evidence (including the aforementioned inconsistencies in her evidence) and considering the context of these alleged incidents, I was also not persuaded by the Complainant’s submissions that what was alleged of the Respondent (under both her reasons) constituted acts of continual harassment by him of A, with the intention to cause anguish to A (or with the knowledge that they were likely to cause anguish to A). On his alleged state of undress, there was no evidence that the Respondent had exposed himself to A as acts of continual harassment to A, intending or knowing that such acts were likely to cause anguish to A. The Complainant’s evidence was that the Respondent always went to bed dressed, but his prayer dress had shifted sometimes at night (whilst he was sleeping) to expose his lower half. There was no allegation that the Respondent even knew that A had woken up on those occasions when she allegedly saw his lower half exposed.

27     The Respondent denied that he was not properly dressed at home or whilst sleeping. If his prayer dress did ride up at times in the middle of the night whilst he was asleep exposing his lower half, this was not intentional on his part. There had been no conversation with him, or views shared with him earlier over his allegedly inappropriate dressing at home. He maintained that what was stated about this in the Complaint was a false allegation by the Complainant. But, if she were to share her views with him now and ask for any changes, he was prepared to agree to changes if they were for the welfare of the family. In this regard, I noted his response (below, during cross-examination) that he was agreeable to sleeping in a separate bedroom from the Children for the welfare of the family.[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13)

_“Q:_ _…If it is for the welfare of the family, you can agree to sleep in bedroom which is separate from 2 daughters?_

_A:_ _Yah, of course, of course,uhuh can be agreed. It’s not a problem. Uh, for me, my family is important.”_

28     For all the above reasons, I was therefore not satisfied that the Complainant had proven, on a balance of probabilities, that family violence (as defined in section 64 of the Act) had been committed by the Respondent against A (or was likely to be committed by the Respondent against A) and accordingly, I dismissed the application.

## PPO application for B

29     In respect of the PPO application for B, having heard the evidence of the Complainant and the Defendant, I was also not satisfied that the Complainant had proven, on a balance of probabilities, the first limb of section 65(1) of the Act.

30     In brief, the Complainant’s case for B as alleged in her Complaint was this: She had been _told_ by B (her 3-year old daughter) that she had touched her papa’s “dash dash” on the night of 14 February 2018. According to the Complainant, the term “dash dash” meant the private parts of a person. This alleged incident happened after the Respondent had returned home from work that night.

31     Neither the Complainant nor A had witnessed the alleged incident. But according to the Complainant, this was what B had _told_ the 2 of them that night (after B had dinner in the kitchen) and after they had each questioned B (in turn) as to what video B had been watching earlier.

32     In her Complaint (made on 19 February 2018), she also said that when she asked the Respondent later that night about what B had said, the Respondent was angry and replied that whilst he was sleeping, maybe B could have touched him. He told the Complainant to clarify with B. Thereafter, the Respondent left the home for a while and when he returned, the Complainant said he started talking to her like nothing had happened. The next morning (15 February 2018), the Complainant asked B who was the person who had asked her “to touch” and B had informed her that it was “papa”. This was what was set out in her Complaint.

33     In her statement (Exhibit C1) filed on 18 May 2018 before the hearing, the Complainant stated that she (and A) were _not sure_ what had happened on the night of 14 February 2018 between the Respondent and B. But as they were shocked and nervous (by what B had told them), on the 15 February 2018, she had gone to the Family Service Centre (“FSC”) and then to the police station to file a police report against the Respondent. Thereafter, on the same day, she had left the Flat with the Children and moved into a shelter.

34     In the Complainant’s police report of 15 February 2018, the Complainant only made this one statement:

“_On 14/02/2018 at about 1900hrs -1930hrs, my 3 years old daughter was asked by my husband to do something which she was not supposed to do.”_

The Complainant did not set out any other details or make any other allegations in her report.

35     At the hearing, only the Complainant gave evidence for this PPO application. Her counsel did not call any other witness to testify for this application.

36     The Complainant confirmed under cross-examination that the night of 14 February 2019 was an isolated event. It was the only time that B had ever said to her this – “_I touched papa’s dash dash_”. The Complainant also agreed that she did not ask B any further question at the time as to what B had meant by that sentence or how B had touched her “papa’s dash dash”. This was notwithstanding her own admission that, at that time, she did not understand what B had meant.

37     The Complainant also confirmed that she did _not_ know what had actually happened on that night and that she did _not_ believe B totally and still had doubts about what B had said. The Complainant said that she had been told that the matters in her police report were still under investigation and she was therefore awaiting the outcome of the investigations.

38     I now set out the Complainant’s oral testimony in Court of what happened that night (as she had only given brief details in her Complaint).

39     Whilst she had claimed that the alleged incident occurred about 7 to 7.30pm on 14 February 2018 after the Respondent came back from work, I noted that the Complainant had also agreed that it was usual for the Respondent to come home from work about 8pm.[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14) In this regard, I noted that the Respondent’s evidence was that he had returned home that night only about 8pm.

40     Next, the Complainant testified that when the Respondent returned home that night, he had gone into the Common Room to change his clothes and that B had also gone into the same room whilst he was changing his clothes. However, when the Complainant was cross-examined on this part of her evidence (and shown the layout of the Flat), she admitted that she had _not_ seen the Respondent going into the Common Room to change his clothes that night and she had also _not_ seen when B had entered the same room as she was cooking in the kitchen. As such, the Complainant admitted that what she had testified earlier was not correct. She in fact had no idea that night whether B had gone into the Common Room whilst the Respondent was changing his clothes.

41     The Complainant then testified that whilst she was in the kitchen, she had called out to B many times but as there was no response, she had walked out of the kitchen to the Common Room to call B. And, she was just outside the Common Room when she saw the Respondent lying on the bed in the room. It was not disputed that the bed was a mattress on the floor in the Common Room. The Complainant also did not dispute the bed’s location in the room and the Respondent’s position on the bed as set out in his diagram in Exhibit R2.[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15)

42     It was therefore the Complainant’s evidence that when she first saw the Respondent from her position just outside the Common Room, he was already lying on the bed. She also agreed (during cross-examination) that B was at the time seated on the bed, on the Respondent’s right side (near his hip) and that B was _holding onto the iPad_ and _watching something on it_[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16) and B was _engrossed_ with it.[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17) She also agreed that the room was dark at the time.

43     The Complainant said that when she was calling for B just outside the Common Room, she _saw_ the Respondent pulling his prayer dress down from somewhere in his middle section. But when she was cross-examined as to where he had allegedly pulled it down to, she said she did not know. This was rather difficult to believe as it was also her evidence that it was precisely because she saw him pulling down his prayer dress and had felt ‘awkward’ about that that she had walked into the room immediately, stood next to them and asked them what they were doing.[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18) Yet, I noted that the Complainant was unable to answer questions as to where the Respondent had allegedly pulled his prayer dress down to and said repeatedly that she did not know. And when, it was finally put to her by the Respondent’s counsel that nothing was in fact going on with his attire, the Complainant response was this - “_I don’t know_”. [\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19)

44     Next, the Complainant’s evidence was that when she was inside the Common Room and standing next to the Respondent and B (who were still on the bed, the Respondent was lying down and B was seated on his right side, near his hip), she had asked them what they were doing and the Respondent had replied that B was watching cartoons on the iPad. The Complainant then told B that it was dinner time and asked B to come out with her. According to her, B did not come out of the room immediately but only about 15 minutes later.

45     On this part of her evidence as to what happened when she entered the Common Room, I noted that it was _not_ set out in her Complaint that she had entered the Common Room and had asked the Respondent and B what they were doing. Secondly, going by her own account of this alleged episode, I noted that she had _not_ brought B out of the Common Room with her (this was despite her allegation about having seen the Respondent pulling down his prayer dress when he heard her calling for B), but had left the Common Room first after simply instructing B to come out for dinner, which B did some 15 minutes later.

46     The Complainant then said it was later that night (after she had given B dinner in the kitchen) that she then asked B what video she was watching (as she still had a “doubt”). And, it was in response to this particular question from her about the video, that B had smiled in a funny way and said that she had touched “papa’s dash dash”. The Complainant then said that she “did not understand” and she also “did not clarify” with B at the time.[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20) But, according to the Complainant, she had asked A to ask B again and B had responded the same way. It should be noted that A (11 years old at the time of the hearing) was never called by the Complainant’s counsel to testify at this hearing.

47     There were also parts of the Complainant’s evidence (set out earlier) which I had found questionable. If the Complainant was indeed inside the Common Room and standing right next to the Respondent and B (who were both on the mattress on the floor) and she was concerned as to what they were doing at the time (having allegedly seen the Respondent pulling down his prayer dress), then she would clearly have been able to determine for herself whether and what B was watching on the iPad at the time. Here, I noted that the Complainant had also agreed under cross-examination that B did watch cartoons on the iPad.

48     Further, if the Complainant had at the time really felt that there was something wrong about the whole situation (with her alleged sighting of the Respondent pulling down his prayer dress), it would have been natural for the Complainant to bring B out of the Common Room with her. Instead, according to the Complainant, she had simply told B to come out for dinner and she had then left the Common Room first on her own. And yet, much later, after B had come out and had had her dinner, the Complainant’s evidence was that as she had a ‘doubt’ over what she saw earlier, she had asked B what video the child was watching.

49     I also found it curious that even though the Complainant said she did _not_ understand B’s reply at the time and could not believe it, yet she did not see it fit to immediately clarify with B what she had meant or how and why she had touched her “papa’s dash dash”.

50     It was also difficult to believe the Complainant’s evidence that in response to a specific question (repeated twice) as to what video she was watching that night, that a 3-year old child would not answer that question directly but would respond with this same sentence “_I touched papa’s dash dash_”. And, this was especially so given that the child was holding the iPad and had been engrossed with watching something on it earlier (see the Complainant’s evidence at paragraph 42 above).

51     The next part of the Complainant’s evidence was when she had asked the Respondent for an explanation of what B had said to her. According to her, this happened later that night when the Respondent came out of the room and asked her about dinner. Here I noted that the Complainant did not dispute the Respondent’s evidence that he had continued sleeping after B had left the Common Room and that he had only come out about slightly past 10pm to ask her for dinner. The Complainant’s evidence as to what happened with the Respondent is set out below:[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21)

_“I asked the Respondent that my younger daughter have said a few things and… said that she touched his private part._ **_So I asked the Respondent who … who had asked the private part to be touched and also asked him for an explanation as to why she had said that. He … the Respondent told me that whilst he was sleeping, she could have touched him. And also, the Respondent told me that any clarification should be with her, not with him. He denied knowing anything further about this and he left. He left home and went to the food court. Then subsequently, Your Honour, he returned back home after a while and spoke to me casually as if nothing happened, Your Honour_** _. I … I recall that I had also asked her one more thing, clarified one more matter with her._

**_I … I now recall that I have also clarified one more thing with my daughter. I had asked her, Your Honour, “Who had asked you to touch”. She responded, “Its papa.” My elder daughter also asked her the same question._** _Your Honour, the next day, we went down to FSC because this matter impacted me and I was not able to digest it. So, because of that, I made a trip to FSC and the officer over there told me that I should report this matter to the police…”_

52     Based on her above evidence, the Complainant was therefore saying that both she as well as A again had clarified with B as to who had asked her “to touch”. She also appeared to be saying (from the flow of her evidence and her questions to the Respondent) that they had sought this clarification on the night of 14 February 2018 itself. However, I noted that her Complaint had stated that she had only asked B this question the next morning (that is, on the 15 February 2018). Further, there was also no mention in her Complaint about A having also asked B this same question on the 15 February 2018.

53     I turn now to the term “dash dash”. Based on the Complainant’s first explanation during cross-examination (set out below)[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22), it would appear that B only knew the term “dash dash” as referring to her own private areas where she had had rash before.

_“Q:_      _She is 3 years old. Why did she use the word “dash dash”?_

_A:_      _Because sometimes when she goes out, she gets rashes in her private area and I have ever taught her to refer to private area as dash dash.”_

I also noted the Complainant’s following evidence:[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23)

_“Q:_ _Did she say how did … did he take her hand and put on his private part? Did she say anything about that?_

_A:_ _I did not ask her that_

_Q:_ _You did not ask. So she just say that she touched papas’ dash …. Okay?_

_A:_ _Yes, your Honour_

_Q:_ _Hmm. Was she crying?_

_A:_ _No, she did not_

_Q:_ _She … was she normal?_

_A:_ _Yes, your Honour.”_

54     But, the Complainant’s subsequent testimony was that this term “dash dash” when applied to a man meant only his penis and no other part. Why then would a 3-year child know anything about a man’s penis? When asked this in cross-examination, the Complainant’s response was this: [\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24)

_“A:_ _She don’t know unless he show”_

Having said this, the Complainant then went on to allege (for the first time) that, _prior_ to 14 February 2018, B had talked before about her papa’s dash dash during the “_one or two times when she saw the Respondent without dress, whilst he was dressing that time_”.[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25) And, when asked what B had said during those “_one or two times_”, the Complainant’s prompt response was this - that B had said that she had _seen_ her papa’s dash dash.

55     The Complainant then went on to further allege (also for the first time) that she had felt really awkward about B seeing the Respondent’s genitals whilst he was changing clothes during those one or two times and that she had told the Respondent not to change in front of B and not to wear very short trousers as they will “_expose his private parts sometimes_”. However, when she was questioned as to how B could see his private parts when he wore very short trousers, the Complainant’s response was this:[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26)

_“A:_      _Shorts ... she don’t comment so much on it. The comments will be from the elder daughter. My elder daughter, she don’t like such type of dress, especially when he wear that outside, outside home."_

56     I turn now to the Respondent’s evidence. The Respondent denied that he had ever asked B to touch his genitals on 14 February 2018.

57     His evidence in his affidavit (Exhibit R1) was as follows. On that night, he had reached home at about 8pm. He had then taken a shower and it was about 8.10pm when he entered the Common Room to prepare for his daily evening prayers. He was dressed in his longer prayer dress. But, as he was tired after a long day at work, he decided to take a nap on the bed which was a mattress on the floor. His position on this bed in the room was tendered during the hearing (Exhibit R2) and confirmed by the Complainant.

58     According to the Respondent, he had switched off the lights in the room and had fallen asleep. But shortly after, he was awoken briefly from his nap by B. She had come into the room and she wanted to watch cartoons on his tablet which was at that time lying on the bed. As B had insisted on watching cartoons on his tablet, he had switched it on for her and she sat next to him on the mattress, on his right side. He was lying on the mattress and he fell back to sleep.

59     It was shortly after that he heard the Complainant calling out to B to have her dinner. According to him, it was whilst B was crawling over him in the dark room that she had fallen carelessly on his upper thighs and that woke him up. In a half-asleep state, he had then picked her up and placed her beside him so that she could leave the room without further obstruction. He then went back to sleep and only woke up later that night about 10.20pm. He then made his way to the kitchen to have his dinner. But, when he entered the kitchen and looked around, there did not seem to be any dinner prepared for him. He then walked into the Master Bedroom. The Complainant was present in the Master Bedroom. B was then asleep in the same room. The Complainant seemed upset and she informed him that B had told her that she had seen his genitals. The Respondent was stunned by what she said. He then informed her that the child had merely fallen on him whilst he was sleeping and she might have seen his genitals in the process without his knowledge. Further, as he was wearing a brown floor length prayer dress, B might have seen his genitals purely by accident. He had never asked B to touch him inappropriately. He was upset that the Complainant had even insinuated that he had behaved inappropriately towards B. He then decided to have dinner at a nearby coffee shop instead as there was no food at home.

60     The Respondent had maintained throughout his evidence that there was no basis or truth in the Complainant’s accusations that he had committed family violence against the Children. According to him and as mentioned earlier, her PPO applications for the Children were really motivated by their marital disputes with each other, in particular, their disputes over her relationship with M (see paragraphs 13 and 14 above).

## Reasons for dismissal of B’s PPO Application

61     Having heard the parties and based on the evidence adduced before the Court, I was not satisfied that the Complainant had proven, on a balance of probabilities, that family violence (as defined in section 64 of the Act) had been committed by the Respondent against B (or was likely to be committed by the Respondent against B).

62     Firstly, as mentioned earlier, the Complainant agreed that she did not actually know what had happened that night. It should be noted that her own evidence was that she still had doubts over what B had said and that investigations into her report were still going on and she was in fact awaiting the outcome of these investigations.

63     Secondly, it was also not disputed that the Complainant’s allegation was based entirely on what she said her 3-year old child had told her. However, I had found the Complainant’s account of what had happened that night, at parts, to be questionable for the reasons as set out in the earlier paragraphs. There were also various contradictions and inconsistencies in her evidence as highlighted in the earlier paragraphs. And, having heard the Respondent’s version of what happened that night, I could not say that the Respondent’s version that the Complainant had never entered the Common Room but had only called for B from outside the Common Room to come out for dinner was not believable. As mentioned, there were doubts as to whether the Complainant had allegedly even seen any movement relating to the Respondent’s prayer dress. Given also the Complainant’s acceptance of B’s seated position on the Respondent’s right side whilst he was lying on the mattress on the floor, it was possible that B could have touched the Respondent’s genitals accidentally while making her way (over him) out of the Common Room after hearing the Complainant call for her. It was noted that when B said that she had “touched papa’s dash-dash”, she was not in a state of fear, anxiety or distress.[\[note: 27\]](#Ftn_27) In fact, the Complainant’s evidence was that B had smiled in a funny manner when narrating the fact that she had touched her father’s genitals.

64     There was also no complaint nor evidence adduced by the Complainant of any alleged prior acts of physical violence or aggression by the Respondent towards the Children. There was also no complaint nor evidence adduced by the Complainant of any alleged prior acts by the Respondent towards the Children which had caused hurt to the Children or put them in fear of hurt (as defined in section 64 of the Act).

65     Accordingly, the PPO application for B was dismissed.
