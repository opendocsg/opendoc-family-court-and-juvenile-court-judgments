Variation of Ancillary Order – Custody Care Control and Access – Relocation

12 November 2020

### District Judge Goh Zhuo Neng:

## Introduction

1       This hearing was mainly concerned with two competing applications by the Defendant mother (“**Mother**”) and Plaintiff father (“**Father**”) to relocate the children of the family (“**Children**”).

> a)     Mother’s Relocation Application - SUM1101 of 2020 filed on 6 April 2020 to relocate the Children to Amsterdam as soon as possible.

> b)     Father’s Relocation Application – SUM1279 of 2020 filed on 22 May 2020 to relocate the Children to the United Kingdom of England and Wales (“**UK**”) in the summer of 2021.

2       The Mother also prayed for the Court to appoint a Child Representative. The Father did not object to a Child Representative being appointed.

3       The prayers in both Relocation Applications are set out at **Annex A** and **B** respectively.

4       On 3 August 2020, I heard both applications and both parties were represented by counsel. I ordered that the Father be permitted to relocate the Children to the UK in the summer of 2021. I also made orders for the Father to have care and control of the Children, with consequential provisions for the Mother to have access to the Children. This was essentially a variation of ancillary orders I had made on 30 December 2018 (**Annex C**). The variations that I had ordered are set out in strikethrough and underline in **Annex D**.

5       I also heard a further application by the Father in SUM2043 of 2020 which was filed on 27 July 2020. The full terms of relief sought by the Father under this application are set out at **Annex E**. In substance, the Father was seeking the following relief:

> a)     Allowing the Father to regularise the Children’s immigration status in Singapore. There was a concern the Mother’s employment pass would terminate prior to the resolution of the relocation applications, together with the Children’s linked dependant’s passes. At the time of hearing, there was no reason to believe that the Mother’s employment pass was invalid, so I made no order under SUM2043 of 2020.

> b)     Allow the Children to remain with the Father until the Mother had served her Stay Home Notice. At the time of the hearing, the Mother had returned from an overseas trip and was serving Stay Home Notice. This was confirmed by the Mother’s counsel. As the Mother was physically unable to have the Children with her due to the Stay Home Notice, I made no order under SUM2043 of 2020.

> c)     Require the Mother to hand over the Children’s official documents, including passports and medical documents pending the hearing of the relocation applications. The Father had also inserted a similar prayer as part of his relocation application, I made no order under SUM2043 of 2020, as this issue would be resolved through the Relocation Applications.

> d)     To strike out the Mother’s relocation application if her submissions were not filed by 29 July 2020. No order was required here under SUM2043 of 2020, as the Mother eventually filed her written submissions on 28 July 2020.

The Father has not appealed against my decision to dismiss SUM2043 of 2020.

6       On 13 August 2020, the Mother filed a Notice of Appeal against my decision in SUM1101 of 2020 and SUM1279 of 2020. I set out below the full grounds of my decision.

## B.   BACKGROUND

#### (1)    Parties and Children

7       The Mother is a citizen of the USA. The Father is a citizen of the UK. They were married in the UK on 14 January 2006. The Children hold dual citizenship of the USA and UK and turn 10 and 11 years old this year.

8       The parties have been living in Singapore since 2013. Both parties reside in Singapore on employment passes, and have not taken up permanent residency in Singapore. The Children reside in Singapore on dependent’s passes linked to the employment pass of the Mother.

#### (2)    The Divorce Proceedings and Ancillary Orders

9       This is not the first attempt to relocate the Children. Divorce proceedings were commenced by the Father on 3 January 2017, with the interim judgment being granted on 20 March 2018.

10     During the hearing of the ancillary matters in 2018, the Mother had asked the Court to grant her leave to relocate the Children to the UK. The Father did not object to an eventual relocation to the UK, but had asked that this take place in 3-4 years’ time (2021 - 2022).

11     On 30 November 2018, I heard the ancillary matters and dismissed the Mother’s application to relocate the Children to the UK.

12     I also ordered that parties shall have joint custody of the Children. Care and control of the Children was awarded to the Mother, and the Father was to have access to the Children on alternate weeks from 3.00pm or after school on Mondays, to 3.00pm on or after school on the Monday of the following week. Parties would also split the school holidays and school vacations 50-50. My full orders on care and control (“**Ancillary Orders**”) are set out at **Annex C**.

13     This arrangement effectively gave the parties 50-50 access to the Children, notwithstanding that the Mother was to have care and control. This was also a continuation of the arrangement that the parents had put into effect under a consent order made in OSGxxx of 2016 dated 1 February 2017.

14     Parties then filed the present applications for relocation in 2020.

## C.   APPOINTMENT OF A CHILD REPRSENTATIVE

15.    The Mother had asked for a Child Representative to be appointed to represent the Children’s interests in the matter, and the Father had stated he had no objections to one being appointed.

16     This was on the basis that the Children felt trapped in the middle of the Father and Mother and were unable to communicate their feelings freely to the Father. In this regard, examples were provided of how the Children were unhappy due to the quarrelling between their parents over relocation (in addition to other issues), and a piece of school work by one of the Children referring to how he was affected by the quarrelling between the parents was exhibited by the Mother.

17     Rule 30(1) of the Family Justice Rules provides that like all orders relating to the welfare of the Children, when determining whether to appoint a Child Representative, the best interests of the Children must be paramount. I took the view that what is in the best of interests of the Children must be determined in the context of each application. In the case of the Relocation Application, that would be the choice of country to relocate to.

18     In the present case, I did not think that the Mother had satisfied me that it would be in the best interests of the Children to appoint a Child Representative to act for them to assist the Court to decide where to relocate them. It was insufficient to say (without more) that the Children were unhappy and needed to share their feelings, without drawing a direct connection to how this unhappiness related to the Relocation Applications i.e. their choice of country to relocate to.

19     It seems that the Children were just unhappy as a result of the parents quarrelling and relocation was just one of these topics. There was no evidence that they had expressed concerns about which specific country they were going to relocate to. Therefore, I proceeded to determine the matter without appointing a Child Representative.

## D.   THE LAW ON RELOCATION

20.    The general principles on relocation can be summarised as follows:

> a)     There is only one fundamental legal principle in a relocation application – that the welfare of the child was paramount and this should override any other consideration. See _BNS v BNT_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 973</span> at \[19\].

> b)     In considering the welfare of the child, the wishes of the caregiving parent and the loss of the child’s relationship with the stay behind parent were _both_ determinative, but not singularly determinative factors that trumped all other relevant considerations. See _BNS v BNT_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 973</span> at \[21\].

> c)     The wishes of parents may have a bearing on the welfare of the child, but it is for the court to determine if their wishes are compatible with the interests of the child – which must be put before their own. See _BNS v BNT_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 973</span> at \[19\]. It was emphasized that even the personal well being of the primary caregiver of the children (while not unimportant) cannot trump the welfare of the Children. _BNS v BNT_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 973</span> at \[29\].

21     While this is a multifactorial assessment, I also set out below some other factors that caselaw has drawn attention to:

> a)     The caregiving parent’s reasons for relocation. In _TAA v TAB_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 2 SLR 879</span> at \[21\], the High Court found that the parent seeking to relocate did not have an adequate reason for relocating the Children to Spain. This was because the decision to relocate appeared to be for the benefit of the caregiving parent’s new spouse who was Spanish. Likewise in the case of _UXH v UXI_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHCF 24</span> at \[17 and 20\], the High Court found that the decision of the primary caregiver to relocate to the UK with her partner who she wished to marry still had to be considered in the context of the welfare of the Children, and she was _“not entirely free to make choices that a single or divorced person without children might be able to make.”_

> b)     The adequacy of the relocation plan. In _BNT v BNS_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 859</span> at \[45 and 46\], the High Court stated that the Court should scrutinise the relocation plan with care to satisfy itself that there is a genuine motivation for the move and that the move is not intended to bring contact between the children and the stay behind parent to an end. The High Court in that case found that the Mother’s relocation plan was not thoroughly thought through. This belied her claim that she was relocating to Canada to seek the support of her extended family. The High Court found that she was actually motivated by a desire to avoid the unpleasantness of having to maintain contact with the Father. This finding was not overturned by the Court of Appeal in _BNS v BNT_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 973</span>.

> c)     The ability of the Children to adapt to a new environment. In _TAA v TAB_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 2 SLR 879</span> at \[25\], the High Court also considered that it might not be in the welfare of the Children to uproot the children from Singapore and relocate them to a new country (Spain) where they would have to learn a new language and face a new education system.

## E.   APPLICATION OF THE LAW TO THE FACTS

22     In the present case, both parents agreed that the Children should relocate from Singapore, and the real issue to be determined was whether Amsterdam or the UK should be preferred and when this relocation should take place. Therefore, I focused on addressing the following factors below.

(I)    _Reason for Relocation – Longstanding Intention to Move to the UK_

23     The Father explained that the parties had a longstanding intention to relocate the Children to the UK. As stated above, during the hearing of the ancillary matters in 2018, the Mother had already asked the Court to grant her leave to relocate the Children to the UK immediately, while the Father had asked for the relocation to be delayed till some time in 2021/2022.

24     The evidence submitted by parties indicated that the intention to relocate to the UK continued to be shared by the parties even after the ancillary matters had been determined in 30 December 2018.

> a)     By an email dated 1 September 2019 (timed at 6.20pm), the Mother confirmed to the Father that she was agreeable to the Children relocating to the UK in the summer of 2021.

> b)     The Parties engaged UK lawyers with the intention of entering into a mirror order in the UK to record the terms of the access arrangements in the UK. A draft proposal was circulated by the Mother’s UK lawyer’s letter of 22 January 2020 to the Father’s UK lawyer (“**22 January Letter**”). The 22 January Letter addressed the arrangements for access when the Mother _“resides partially in Europe for 12 months to job search”_ while the Children remained in Singapore, as well as the terms of access once the parties and Children had both relocated to the UK.

> c)     The Children attended classes to prepare them for entry into grammar school in the UK. The parties even contemplated moving them from their current school in Singapore which follows the international school curriculum, into another school which follows the UK school curriculum.

25     This was not a smooth path for the parties. Assessments of the Children in November 2019 indicated that they were not currently at the level required for transition to the UK education system. The Mother claimed that the Father had decided that the parties would no longer relocate to the UK, which prompted her to file her application for relocation to Amsterdam. She cited in support, the Father’s UK lawyer’s letter dated 10 February 2020 to the Mother’s UK Lawyer (“**10 February Letter**”) which states:

> “Thank you for your letter of 22 January 2020. **For the avoidance of doubt, it is not agreed that the children should relocate to England and Wales in 2021.** \[Mother\] has been asked to put forward her clear proposals for such a move so that \[Father\] can give them some thought. Your letter throws up more queries than it answers his concerns. Please could \[Mother\] therefore attend to the following:

> For shared arrangements to work in England and Wales, \[Mother\] and \[Father\] will need to live close together and agree upon suitable schools. Please confirm where your client proposes to live upon her return.

> When is your client proposing to leave Singapore? You refer to “12 months” but it is not clear when this commences.

> Please provide a copy of the Singapore order dated 18th January 2017.”

> (emphasis added)

26     I took the view that the 10 February Letter was simply a reservation of rights in respect of the draft proposals taken in the 22 January Letter. At most, it acknowledged that without such an agreement, there would not be any relocation of the Children to the UK in 2021. If this letter was intended to terminate the Father’s intention to relocate the Children to the UK, why would it seek clarifications on the positions in the 22 January Letter? Notably, these proposals were being exchanged openly, and not on a without prejudice basis.

27     The 10 February Letter was also not the last word between the parties. This came from the Mother’s UK lawyers on 13 February 2020 notifying that they were seeking instructions from the Mother to respond to the clarifications that the Father was seeking in the 10 February Letter.

> “Thank you for your letter of 10 February 2020. I am seeking further instructions from \[Mother\] although I am pleased to note that the issues of clarification are limited in scope. I hope to have clarification to you on these points shortly.”

28     No further response was provided by the Mother. On 6 April 2020, the Mother filed her application for relocation to Amsterdam.

(II)    _Reasons for Relocation – Mother’s Retrenchment_

29     The Mother claimed that on February 2020, she had been retrenched by her employer, with her last day of employment on 12 August 2020. As her residence in Singapore was tied to her employment pass which would terminate shortly after that, the Children would have to relocate with her. She was also unable to find a suitable position in Singapore. On this point, it is not clear whether the Mother was retrenched or had simply resigned as she had not exhibited copies of her retrenchment letter in the evidence.

30     The Mother also claimed that her retrenchment had affected the original premise of relocating to the UK, which was for her to continue working in the UK office of her Singapore employers. This “_premise_” is contradicted by evidence which shows that prior to allegedly losing her job in February 2020, the Mother was already looking for positions in the UK with other employers.

> a)     The proposals set out by the Mother’s lawyers in the 10 January Letter indicated that she would be residing partially in Europe to _job search for 12 months_ prior to the Children relocating to the UK.

> b)     The Mother was had already made contact with prospective employers before she was allegedly retrenched in mid-February 2020. By an email dated 18 January 2020 (timed at 8.12pm) forwarded by a contact to a prospective employer to introduce the Mother, it is stated that the Mother is _“currently out in Singapore leading \[employer\] across APC and is looking for a move back to Europe”_. In the reply email dated 7 February 2020 (timed at 7.57pm) with a prospective employer, the prospective employer notifies the Mother that locations for employment were available in London, New York and Amsterdam.

31     From the above evidence, it is clear that the Mother’s alleged retrenchment should not be regarded as a strong factor affecting the parties’ intention to relocated to the UK.

(III)    _Reasons for Relocation – Mother’s Preference for Amsterdam_

32     The Mother explained that she intended to relocate the Children to Amsterdam as she was going to marry her partner (a citizen of Holland) who lived in Amsterdam. As a spouse of a citizen of Holland, her immigration status in Amsterdam would be more stable and it would be easier for her to find a job there.

33     This was contrasted with the UK, where she would not have valid immigration status in without a job. She cited the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, and that as a result of the UK leaving the European Union (“**Brexit**”), marriage to her partner who was a citizen of Holland (“**EU Citizen**”) would not give her automatic rights of employment in the UK.

34     I did not give these factors much weight. The coronavirus pandemic was a neutral factor where finding a job in the UK and Holland was concerned. There were no exceptional factors provided by the Mother to show why it would be harder to find a job in the UK than in Amsterdam due to the pandemic.

35     Furthermore, the issue of Brexit and its impact on her immigration status as the spouse of an EU citizen should not have taken the Mother by surprise. She had been advocating relocation of the Children to the UK since 2018. The impact of Brexit on her plans would have been in her mind as by then, Article 50 had been triggered by the UK in 2017 to begin the process of leaving the European Union.

(IV)    _Reasons for Relocation – Conclusion_

36     I found that the Mother’s reasons for relocation to Amsterdam were not being taken in the best interests of the Children. She appeared to be more focused on her desire to remarry her partner and live with him in Amsterdam. It should be noted that while the Mother has been with her partner since mid-2017, she had been seeking a relocation of the Children to the UK since 2018 and as recently as early 2020. Why would the intention to relocate to the UK be affected by their marriage?

37     It was clear to me that the choice of the relocation to the UK was a factor being taken in the best interests of the Children. After all, this was the intention of both parties as recently as early 2020, and a lot of effort and planning had been taken by the parties to achieve this. I am not going as far as to say that it was an estoppel that bound the Mother. However, I did not find that the reasons cited by the Mother in favour of a relocation to Amsterdam were being taken in the best interests of the Children.

(V)    _Relocation Plans_

38     Here, I found that the plans for relocation to the UK were better thought out and considered. The Children were already being prepared by the parents to adapt to the new curriculum in the UK. The Father had also identified a location in the UK where he wished to relocate to and had confirmed with several schools in the vicinity of that location that there were places for the Children in 2021. Confirmations of the places in these schools, and the curriculum brochures of these schools were exhibited in the Father’s affidavits.

39     The Mother on the other hand was not able to disclose which location in Amsterdam she would be living in. She could only say that she intended to purchase a house to live in with her new partner. In respect of schooling, the Mother intended to place the Children in an international school in Amsterdam. However, an email from the school dated 17 March 2020 (timed at 9.31pm) stated that there were currently no places for the Children in the school for entry in 2020 and they would only be placed on the waitlist.

40     At the hearing, the Mother’s counsel claimed that the Mother had finalised arrangements relating to the education and accommodation of the Children and wished to file a further affidavit. I did not allow further affidavits to be filed as it was not even clear to me that such an affidavit had been sworn and was ready to be filed. Furthermore, it would not be fair for this evidence to be submitted so late in the day – presumably after the allotted date for hearing. If the Mother was serious about her decision to relocate the Children, these issues should have been determined prior to the filing of her application. This lack of preparedness indicated that the intention to move to Amsterdam was more afterthought than forethought.

(VI)    _Ability of the Children to Adapt to a new environment_

41     In relocation, the Children would face separate challenges adapting to a new environment. For the UK, they would have to deal with a new curriculum, which they were currently facing challenges in adapting to. For Amsterdam, the Mother explained that they would first move to an international school where classes were conducted in English, but the intention was to prepare them for a transition to a bilingual curriculum (English and Dutch) in a couple of years. This would require them to acquire the ability to become fluent in the Dutch language.

42     On balance, I found that it would be easier for the Children to adapt to a move to the UK curriculum. They were currently facing challenges in doing so, but they would have a longer runway to transition as they would only relocate in 2021, and were already attending preparatory classes. This contrasts with the Mother’s intention for them to transition to a curriculum that required fluency in the Dutch language.

43     In support of her application, the Mother provided a newspaper article about the advantages of schooling in Holland, as well as statistics from the Program for International Student Assessment (“**PISA**”). While I considered these articles, I felt that they focused on the general experience of native schooling in Holland and did not address my specific concerns about whether the Children would be able to adapt with their absence of Dutch language skills.

(VII)    _Proximity to Familial Support_

44     I found that the Children would be closer to family if they were to move to the UK. In the UK, they would be close to the paternal side of the family, which included grandparents and cousins. It would not be quite the same in Amsterdam, as they would have no existing family there, save for the Mother’s partner and his children from a previous marriage aged 8, 11 and 13 who the Mother stated did not always live with him. There was also no detail on how frequently his children spent time with him. As far as the maternal side of the family was concerned, they lived in the USA so that connection was largely a neutral factor.

(VIII)    _Conclusion_

45     I found that it would be in the best interests of the Children to relocate to the UK. This had been the intention of the parties since 2018, and they were already being placed on track to do so with preparatory classes for the UK curriculum.

46     The plans to move to the UK were clear, and this was a more manageable transition for the Children who would move in 2021. They would not have to learn a new language, and they were assured of a place in schools near to where they would be living.

47     In contrast, the decision to relocate to Amsterdam seems to have been taken by the Mother in haste, and with little preparation. It was not clear where exactly the Children would live, and whether there were places for them to school in.

48     During the hearing, I had raised these concerns to counsel for the Mother. I was told that weight should be placed on the intentions of the Mother as she had care and control of the children and her basis for doing so was reasonable. This argument missed the point – what was in the best interest of the Children? The law is clear that the well being of the children should take priority over the well being of the primary caregiver.

49     For the reasons above, I ordered that the Father would be permitted to relocate the Children to the UK in the summer of 2021.

## F.   CONSEQUENTIAL ORDERS

50     Following from my orders to relocate the Children, I had to address the consequential effects they would have on care and control of the Children and the Mother’s access to them. I note that the Mother did not have any substantial arguments on these points as the bulk of her evidence was focused on relocation of the Children to Amsterdam.

(I)    _Care and Control_

51     I ordered that the Father would be given care and control of the Children. This was objected to by the Mother’s counsel, who stated that the Father should not be rewarded for succeeding in his application.

52     This was really a consequence of the Mother moving to Amsterdam on the assumption that she would succeed in relocating the Children. It was the clear intention on both sides that the Children would be relocating – just a question of when and where. As I have ordered that they would be relocating to the UK, what sense would there be in allowing the Mother to retain care and control of the Children remotely from Amsterdam?

53     It should not be forgotten that the Father was also very familiar with the routine of the Children and their needs. Parties had been effectively sharing time with the Children on a 50-50 basis since 2017. This was less of a gift to an uninvolved parent, and simply a natural consequence of my decision in this application.

(II)    _Regular Access – Pending Relocation and While the Mother was in Singapore_

54     To address the scenario pending the relocation to the UK and when the Mother was in Singapore, I provided that the current position on regular access under paragraph 4(a) to (j) of the Ancillary Orders would continue, unless agreed between the parties in writing.

55     This was subject to two variations.

> a)     Under Paragraph 4(a) of the Ancillary Orders, the terms of regular access on a 50-50 weekly basis would now change to a biweekly basis. This had been prayed for by the Father, and was meant to address his concern that weekly handovers would be too disruptive for the Children. This was not objected to by the Mother or addressed in her evidence, which focused on relocation.

> b)     As a new paragraph 9B, the Mother would be permitted to have the Children during the whole of the school break in October 2020. This was reasonable in my view, as the Mother’s access had been affected by her Stay Home Notice. However, I made it clear that this access could only be exercised in Singapore, as I did not want the Father’s subsequent access to be affected by the Children having to serve quarantine if they were brought overseas by the Mother.

(III)    _Regular Access – Pending Relocation and Once the Mother Left Singapore and Moves to Amsterdam_

56     To address the scenario where the Mother relocated to Amsterdam pending relocation of the Children to the UK, I inserted a new paragraph 4(k) to the Ancillary Orders giving her access to the Children for two-thirds of the period of the Children’s school breaks. The Mother would give the Father at least one month’s written notice to indicate the period of time that she wishes to have access to the Children. This was not objected to by the Mother, and was similar to the terms of access that she was proposing to give the Father if she were successful in relocating the Children to Amsterdam.

(IV)    _Regular Access – After Relocation_

57.    Once the Children had relocated to the UK, I provided that the Mother would have access to them on the following basis. This would form a new paragraph 4B to the Ancillary Orders.

> “That upon the Children’s relocation to the United Kingdom, the Defendant shall have access to the Children as follows, unless otherwise agreed between the parties in writing:

> The Defendant shall be entitled to have access to the Children on alternate weekends, from after school on Friday to 8.00pm on Sunday.

> The Defendant shall be entitled to have access to the Children for half of the period of the Children’s school breaks. The Defendant shall give the Plaintiff at least one (1) month’s written notice to indicate whether she wishes to have access to the Children for the first half or the second half of the school break.

> The Defendant shall have access to the Children on Mother’s Day each year from 10.00pm the evening before Mother’s Day to 8.00pm on Mother’s Day, if the Children are not already with the Defendant pursuant to the access arrangements above.

> The Defendant shall have access to the Children on her birthday, which falls on 2 July, as follows, if the Children are not already with the Defendant pursuant to the access arrangements above. If the Defendant’s birthday falls on a school day, the Defendant shall have access to the Children from after school to 8.00pm on 2 July. If the Defendant’s birthday falls on a non-school day, including weekends and public holidays, the Defendant shall have access to the Children from 10.00am to 8.00pm on 2 July.

> The Defendant shall be at liberty to bring the Children to Amsterdam, Netherlands, during her alternate weekend access to the Children, her share of the Children’s school breaks and her access to the Children for Mother’s Day.

> The Defendant shall pick up and return the Children to the Plaintiff’s residence, unless otherwise agreed between the parties.

> Both parties are at liberty to bring the Children for overseas trips outside the United Kingdom and Amsterdam, Netherlands during his/her share of school breaks. Each party is to give the other party at least one (1) month’s written notice of his/her intended destination, flight details, accommodation details and contact number.”

58     This amounted to an orders in terms of the Father’s prayers in SUM1279 of 2020 on this issue. I found the access reasonable as it allowed the Mother to continue enjoying half of the school holidays with the Children. Regular access would naturally be limited since the parties were living in separate countries, so alternate weekend access was in my view quite adequate. The terms for access on the Children’s Birthday and Mother’s Day were similar to the existing access under the Ancillary Orders.

59     Two separate issues were raised by the parties’ counsel on the post relocation access scenario:

> a)     The Father’s counsel stated that if the Mother should relocate to the UK, the Father was willing to give her access on a 50-50 basis. I took the view that it was too premature for me to take a view on something that seemed contrary to the Mother’s intention to move to Amsterdam. Furthermore, even if the Mother chose to move to the UK, such a decision could only be properly considered once she was able to state where she would be residing in the UK.

> b)     The Mother’s counsel asked if I would be willing to provide for the contingency that the Mother changed her mind to move to Amsterdam. I explained that I had to assume the Mother was prepared to abide by her decision to relocate to Amsterdam as this was a serious decision impacting the lives of the Children. If the Mother changed her mind on moving to Amsterdam, then that would be something to consider in a future application for relocation.

V.    _Remote Access_

60     Where the parties would be spending time away from the Children, I ordered that the party not with the Children shall have daily phone or video calls with the Children at a reasonable time, after taking into account the time difference. This access would be carried out in the absence of the other party that the Children were currently staying with. This would be a new paragraph 4C of the Ancillary Orders.

VI.    _Handover and Possession of Official and Travel Documents_

61     I also ordered that paragraphs 7 of the Ancillary Orders be varied to reflect that the Children’s travel and/or official documents (including but not limited to the birth certificates and medical records) be held by the Father instead.

62     On this point, I understood from the Mother’s counsel that the Mother was currently serving her Stay Home Notice as she had recently returned from Holland. Therefore, I ordered the insertion of a new paragraph 4D providing that these documents would be handed over to the Father by 11 August 2020, and subject to social distancing requirements. If this was not possible, then the first day after the Mother completed her Stay Home Notice.

63     In respect of travel, Paragraphs 8 and 9 of the Ancillary Order would be varied to reflect that the passports and travel documents would be handed over to the Mother within 7 days after written notice had been provided by her to the Father for overseas travel with the Children under the existing provisions for overseas travel. The Mother would then return the documents to the Father within 7 days after the Children returned from such travel.

VII.    _Children’s Long Term Visit Pass and Dependant’s Pass_

64     Under the Father’s prayer in SUM1279 of 2020, for orders consequential in order to facilitate relocation, I ordered that the Father would be given leave to apply for dependant’s passes for the Children while they were residing in Singapore. This was appropriate considering that the Children’s dependant’s passes were tied to the Mother’s employment and the Mother was relocating to Amsterdam. This would be inserted as a new paragraph 9A.

## G.   CONCLUSION AND COSTS

65     For the reasons set out above, I made the above orders on the division on matrimonial property. As the Mother had not succeeded in her application to relocate the Children to Amsterdam, while the Father did, I ordered that costs would follow the event. I fixed the costs of SUM1101 of 2020 and SUM1279 of 2020 at $3,000.00 (including disbursements) and ordered the Mother to pay these costs to the Father. No cost orders were made for SUM2043 of 2020 as no orders were made under that application.
