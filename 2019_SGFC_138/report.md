S65 Women’s Charter – Personal Protection Order, Domestic Exclusion Orders

9 December 2019

### District Judge Geraldine Kang:

## Brief Background

1       There were 4 applications for Personal Protection Orders (“PPO”) and Domestic Exclusion Orders (“DEO”) before this Court. For ease of reference, parties shall be referred to as Father, Son and Mother in these written grounds of decision. A total of 3 applications were filed by the Son against the Father; with the Father filing 1 cross application against the Son. The hearings spanned across of 6 tranches of hearing days. A brief summary of their respective applications is set out below.

2       It bears noting that when the matter was heard before me, the Son was no longer residing with the Father and Mother at their HDB flat. It was not disputed that as the legal owners of the flat, the Father and Mother had taken steps with the relevant authority to legally remove the Son as an occupier of the flat.

3       It was also not disputed that the Son and Father had filed prior cross PPO applications in 2016 but those applications were withdrawn.

4       The Mother was not present in Court for the hearings and was not called as a witness on account of her mental condition (Alzheimer’s Disease), which was supported by medical memos tendered by both the Father and Son.

5       At the conclusion of the hearing, I dismissed the Son’s applications but granted the Father a PPO against the Son for a limited time of 1 year as well as related counselling orders. The Son has since appealed against the entirety of my decision.

## (1)   The Son’s Case

6       The Son, aged 45 years old, called 2 witnesses in support of his case – his brother and a domestic helper.

7       In support of his own PPO against the Father, the son premised it on verbal harassment as well as consequential physical abuse by the Father. The 3 material incidents have been succinctly summarised by the Father in his Closing Submissions[^1] and I do not propose to detail them here.

#### The Son’s Evidence

8       As a litigant in person, the Son had invested much time and resources in the preparation of his case. He exhibited a resourcefulness that was worthy of praise and recognition. In his closing submissions, he was even able to make reference to an alternative piece of legislation ie. The Vulnerable Adults Act and invited this Court to consider remedies therein. His preparation was meticulous and thorough, with his evidence ranging from audio and video files, affidavits, covert phone conversations with various sources, police reports, email correspondences, text messages and the list goes on. However, it came a point whereby it bordered on unscrupulous means to justify his ends, leading to a seemingly unhealthy fixation to vilify the Father; for which this Court could not condone or accept as a matter of law and procedure.

#### The elder brother’s evidence – Mr ‘B’

9       His evidence provided an insight into the history of this family but did not reside with them as he had his own family commitments to prioritize. His evidence was at best an honest and poignant account of how it was challenging to take care of the elderly couple while managing his own family. Both brothers too appear to be estranged and did not have much interaction with each other in adulthood.

10     Whilst I accepted that the elder brother was concerned about the Mother’s welfare and that he had given his evidence honestly and credibly, there was never any compelling evidence of the Father’s conduct towards the Mother that would legally be defined as family violence that would necessitate a PPO (and DEO) against the Father.

11     Much of the family history presented by Mr ‘B’ appeared to be an unpleasant, if not traumatic walk down memory lane for himself as a youth growing up under his Father’s rules. But again, I found that these may have coloured or confused the present reality of whether there was family violence committed by the Father against the Mother and/or Son.

#### The domestic helper’s evidence – ‘C’

12     ‘C’ was employed by the Father to assist him in the care of the Mother for a period of one year, from May 2018 to June 2019. ‘C’ gave evidence on affidavit and was also present in Court to give oral testimony. As a domestic helper, it was clear that ‘C’ did the best she could to care for the elderly lady under her charge. It was not difficult to imagine being in ‘C’s shoes and that it must have been an overwhelming and daunting experience for her - coming from a simple rural village background to earn a living as a domestic helper, only to be caught in a web of complicated family politics, which culminated in legal proceedings.

13     ‘C’gave her observations of the elderly couple’s interactions candidly. It was a valuable an insight to the elderly couple’s day – they went out for walks, she accompanied them for medical appointments, they had meals together and so forth. On occasions, the Father would walk too fast for the Mother to keep pace. The Father would also have harsh words at times for the Mother, but she felt it was borne out of concern too as the Mother was sometimes stubborn.

14     Her evidence, including the video recordings of the Father’s outbursts were carefully considered by this Court and it was indeed reflective of how this family lived and interacted with each other, on account of the challenges that came with looking after a loved one who suffered from a deteriorating mental condition. The frustration, impatience and helplessness in seeing a loved one lose their mental faculties cannot be so easily described in words, and the ability to control those emotions could have been what caused the Father to react in the manner as observed and described by ‘C’. ‘C’ did not mince her words as to the Father’s harsh conduct and treatment of the Mother in so far as he did hit her on some occasions. But she concluded her evidence with the belief that the Father did indeed dote and love his wife dearly.

15     As to her observations between the Father and Son, there was no dispute that they shared a volatile and tense relationship. ‘C’ too had to play the role of a buffer at times during her employment. After the Son was removed as an occupier from the flat, ‘C’ had facilitated the retrieval of his belongings but this was done in secret and without the knowledge of the Father.

## (2)   The Father’s Case

16     The 81 year old Father stated that he loved the Mother, who was 76 years old, very much. The elderly couple have been married for about 50 years and he was her primary caregiver and companion. He was aided by a domestic helper subsequently as the Mother’s health conditions (Alzheimer’s Disease) deteriorated.

17     Briefly, he conceded to being harsh with his words and treatment toward the Mother at times but this was before he had gained a full insight as to her deteriorating mental condition. His treatment of her was not borne out of malice or any intention to cause hurt nor inflict family violence on her. He poignantly raised an instance whereby she wanted to consume expired food and would not listen to logic or explanation. Out of frustration, he would resort to harshly reprimanding her or even snatching the food from her to prevent her from consuming the food to her own detriment.

18     In response to his Son’s application for a PPO against him, the Father similarly denied any family violence and in fact asserted that it was the Son who had been less than appropriate in his conduct towards the elderly couple. The incidents for which the Father was highlighting appeared to be the basis of an earlier complaint, which was withdrawn in July 2018, prior to the trial of the present applications before me[^2]. Nonetheless, it provided this Court a very compelling background and context to the relationship between the Father and Son. It also bears highlighting that it was a result of these earlier incidents that the family came to the attention of the medical social workers at the hospital where the Father sought medical attention.

19     Similarly, 2 witnesses were called in support of the Father’s case – a social worker as well as a doctor in private practice.

#### The Doctor’s Evidence – Dr’D’

20     As a medical expert with 40 years of experience in the area of psychiatry, Dr ‘D’ gave his evidence in a cogent and helpful manner, in providing an insight into the Mother’s mental faculties. Whilst her deteriorating mental condition was consistent with age-related factors, he did not think that they were compromised to the extent that she was unable to express her preference when asked about current day to day decisions, for instance whom she preferred to live with and who she depended on for her daily care. As testified by Dr ‘D’, the Mother expressed a preference for the Father and appeared to be very trusting of the Mother. However, that Dr ‘D’ also candidly conceded that his interactions with the elderly couple were limited and recent. Nonetheless, even in these limited and recent interactions, he found no cause for concern that the Mother was in any way at risk of any violence or abuse at the hands of the Father.

21     I found no reason to disbelieve Dr ‘D’ s assessment of the elderly couple’s interaction before him even though Dr ‘D’ was not consulted for a specific purpose of whether or not the Father had committed family violence on the Mother. Instead, his role was to assess whether or not the Mother had the mental capacity to make a Lasting Power of Attorney. For the present appeal, it is not necessary for me to go into the details of how Dr ‘D’ came to be the appointed medical practitioner for this separate purpose although the Son tried to harp on this point to suggest that Dr ‘D’ had a separate agenda to take the side of the Father and distort his evidence to suit the Father in the present PPO proceedings.

22     As a professional and expert witness, Dr ‘D’s integrity and opinions were given due weight by this Court. The fact of the matter is that in making his assessment of the Mother, Dr ‘D’ had the opportunity to interact with the Mother and observe the elderly couple together as well as separately.

#### The Social Worker’s Evidence – Ms ‘E’

23     It was with caution that a subpoena was issued for the social worker that worked with this family; however, the relevance and observation of a neutral party was crucial to a fair adjudication and outcome of this case.

24     As an independent and neutral witness, Ms ‘E’ gave a cogent account as to how she and colleagues had conducted home visits over the course of July 2018 to May 2019. These visits were conducted regularly and she had the opportunity to observe the interaction between the elderly couple as well spent time individually with them to work through some of the issues they were struggling with.

25     In summary, her evidence corroborated that of the Father’s ie. As the Mother’s primary caregiver, he felt a deep sense of responsibility towards her needs and could be exacting of the standards expected of her care. He was harsh not only towards the Mother when he felt that she was being petulant and obstinate to her own detriment (ie. The consumption of expired food) but also harsh with the domestic helper when he felt she was negligent in her care of the Mother by constantly being on her mobile phone. The Father too had not missed any of the Mother’s scheduled medical appointments, and was more patient towards the Mother after gaining insight into her deteriorating mental condition.

26     In the course of her home visits, Ms ‘E’ did not observe the Mother to be in fear of the Father. On the contrary, the Mother appeared to be reliant and trusting on the Father. There were flashes of aggression and lapses of memory losses on the Mother’s part, but it was consistent with her mental condition and there was no reason to suspect that the relationship between the elderly couple was fraught with any issues of family violence or malicious hurt inflicted.

## (3)   The Law

27     Under s 65 (1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353) (‘the Charter’) the court may grant a PPO to a family member if it is satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that (1) family violence **has been committed or is likely to be committed** and (2) that it is necessary for the protection of the family member.

28     Section 64 of the Charter defines ‘family violence’ the commission of any of the following acts:

> (a)     wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;

> (b)     causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;

> (c)     wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his will; or

> (d)     causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member, but does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age;”

29     It is established law that two limbs have to be satisfied on a balance of probabilities before a court will issue a PPO in favour of an applicant. First, that an act of violence has been committed in the past or that there is a likelihood of its occurrence in the future. It is clear that there is no need to show that any act of family violence against a family member has actually occurred. It would suffice if there is proof, on a balance of probabilities of the likelihood of commission of family violence in the future.

30     Secondly, that it is necessary for the protection of the family member that an order be made. In the case of **Yue Tock Hin @ Yee Chok Him v Yee Ee Lim <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGDC 99</span>**, the scope of the necessity for protection was discussed:

> _“… a personal protection order is not a punitive measure to punish a person for past violence but is instead an order that serves to restrain the person concerned from committing family violence in future. Therefore, if there will be no family violence in the future, it serves no purpose to restrain the party concerned, and it must follow that a personal protection order would not be necessary”._

## (4)   The Issues

31     This issues arising from this appeal are:

> (a)     Whether the Father has committed family violence against the Mother and/or Son?

> (b)     If the Father had not committed family violence against the Mother and/or Son, would it be likely to be committed?

> (c)     If either (a) or (b) was answered in the affirmative, whether it was necessary for the Mother and/or Son’s protection that a PPO be issued against the Father.

> (d)     If (c) was answered in the affirmative, whether a DEO should be granted against the Father.

> (e)     Whether the Son has committed family violence against the Father?

> (f)     If the Son had not committed family violence against the Father, would it be likely to be committed?

> (g)     If either (d) or (e) was answered in the affirmative, whether it was necessary for the Father’s protection that a PPO be issued against the Son.

## (5)   The Court’s Observations & Decision

32     This was a most unfortunate case as it was apparent that the inter-family relations in the family have been fractured and strained for quite many years. Whilst the Court in a position of a counsellor or therapist to evaluate human interrelations, this was quite obviously a very troubled family filled. The bitterness, anger, resentment and lack of forgiveness, which existed between the Son and the Father, was apparent and underpinned the entire case. The testimony of Mr. ‘B’ merely provided further evidence of this very unfortunate state of family affairs. And most tragically, caught in this web of negativity was the Mother.

33     Fortunately, or unfortunately, she was spared the ordeal of having to come to court to testify for or against 2 of her loved ones, on account of her dementia.

34     In deliberating my decision, it is my hope that this family will have a chance to heal and put aside their grievances so that they can each achieve a certain closure in respect of their own hurts and disappointments. The emotional hurts that each member of this family experienced in their childhood cannot be healed via the law.

35     On the facts of this case, this court could imagine that living and caring for her or any dementia patient was not an easy task – would take a toll on anyone, much less the elderly spouse of hers. Having seen and heard the Father in court over 6 tranches of hearing days, it is my opinion that his current relationship with his wife is one that he cherishes much. It may stem from love, pity, regret, obligation – but I most certainly not qualified as a counsellor to start putting labels on this. But from my observation of his demeanour in court and the manner in which he gave his evidence, his state of vulnerability and confusion, when speaking about his relationship with his wife, led me to the only possible conclusion ie. There was no necessity for the PPO. I also took into account the professional, independent and neutral witnesses that gave evidence – being the social worker and the doctor

36     I would address the fact that on the evidence of before me. Even of the Son succeeded on the first limb, in so far as family violence had taken place, I found no necessity in granting a PPO – it was indeed heart wrenching to hear the elderly man express his desire to spend his twilight years with his spouse of half a decade instead of litigating this in court. I did doubt the sincerity and genuine care the Father had for the Mother especially in light of his better appreciation of her mental deterioration when he further informed the Court that he had even put in place contingency plans for the Mother’s care should he pass on before her – he has made provisions for the Mother to be placed in a nursing home. Such dedication to detail and future planning was a consistent observation by the social worker, who commented that the Father was one who was resourceful and could navigate systems to seek help.

37     For completeness, I would categorically state that, on the balance of probabilities, I was unable to make a finding of fact that family violence had indeed been committed by the Father against the Mother, such that the first legal limb would be satisfied.

38     We all have a past we are not proud of – given a chance, we would all relish the opportunity to do things differently and perhaps even make amends for it. The Father may have ruled over his family with an iron fist in his younger days – thereby scarring them emotionally (as evident in the witness testimony of both his sons and the manner in which the Son held the Father in such disdain before me in court), but for it to fester to the extent that the multiple applications were brought to court is truly an unfortunate tragedy.

39     There was simply no legal basis for me to grant the Son’s application for a PPO and DEO against the Father (for the Mother). The Son argued that he was the primary caregiver of the Mother and thus should be allowed to stay in the flat and the Father should be excluded from the same. As the legal owner of the flat, the Father had every right to remove the Son as an Occupier. The role of the court was not to deliberate the merits of this decision, but the fact that is that as an able bodied man, the Son should be able to support himself and provide a roof over his own head. It was only if there was proven family violence that to the extent that a PPO was granted, could a DEO even be considered. Accordingly, with the dismissal of the PPOs, there was no reason for a DEO to be granted against the Father.

40     In addition, I was also of the opinion, that having seen the personalities and characters before me in court over a sustained period, a PPO would certainly not have healed the wounds but instead exacerbated the issue and would also lead to multiple and perhaps even unnecessary calls to the police for even the most trivial purposes.

41     The Son, in his dealings with authorities and even in his written submissions, has in fact shown scant disregard for appropriate boundaries whenever he felt that an injustice has been done to him (whether actual or perceived). His covert recording of conversations with public servants to further his ends, his contempt towards social workers and public servants who are not aligned with his interests or demands or his agenda, showed a very disingenuous (if not conniving) side to him. Contrary to the accusations levelled by the Son against the Father that the Father was being manipulative, I would have to say that having seen the Son conduct himself the course of the hearing, my opinion of the Son is that he most certainly is one who is very shrewd and astute. Given his instinctive need to right any wrong done to him, he would certainly not hesitate to pursue any means possible. In the circumstances, I find there was certainly no necessity for a PPO for his protection against his Father. Given the age and physical infirmities of the Father as well, I certainly did not see a necessity for a PPO that the Son was seeking.

42     On the other hand, the issue of whether or not the Father should be granted a PPO against the Son was less straightforward. I reiterate my earlier viewpoint that I wished well to the family and that they should work towards healing and closure. Granting a PPO against the Son for the protection of the Father was very much legally justifiable as in my opinion as the father has met both the legal requirements of the law.

43     Had the earlier PPO application been heard by myself, I would have been minded to granted the PPO that the Father was seeking. But in view of the fact that parties had withdrawn those earlier applications, I had to consider the superseding events and not base my current decision earlier incidents.

44     It bears reiterating that the present allegations are not that of physical violence by the Son against the Father. Further, as the Father has removed the Son as an occupier of their flat, they no longer stay under the same roof. As a natural consequence, their daily interaction would be minimal and/or non-existent; as such the tensions and triggers such as the hoarding issues, daily disputes over the care of the Mother will gradually cease to exist. In this regard, the necessity of the PPO is also somewhat negated. However, I took into consideration the fact that there would still be some interactions between the Father and Son as a result of the Son’s desire to see the Mother, to which the Father acknowledges will continue even after these proceedings. In this regard, the Father felt that a PPO against the Son was still necessary.

45     I was of the opinion that notwithstanding the earlier withdrawn complaint, there was still an imminent risk to the Father of family violence. Having seen the dynamics of the parties, their relationship and their temperament in court, I found that there was also a necessity of a PPO being granted against the Son for the Father’s protection.

46     However, in light my earlier expressed desire for this family to heal and get the help they need to move on, this PPO is only for a limited time frame of 1 year (wef 11 September 2019 until 10 September 2020) so as to also allow the family to get the necessary support in the form of counselling as well.
