Family Law – Women’s Charter – Dissolution of marriage – Divorce – Unreasonable behaviour – Whether cultural context of behaviour is relevant – Living together more than 6 months after final incident – Reconciliation

19 August 2019

### District Judge Sheik Mustafa:

## Introduction

1       In this case a wife commenced a writ for divorce against her husband on the ground that he had behaved in such a way that she cannot reasonably be expected to live with him.

2       The husband denied this, and after hearing both sides, it was found that he had in fact behaved so, and the marriage was decreed to be dissolved.

3       The husband appeals against the judgment.

## Background of Case

4       The wife is a 58-year old Singaporean woman. The husband is a 60-year old Singaporean man. They married in Singapore on xxx 1994.

5       They have a daughter, born in xxx. She is the couple’s only child. She is xxx years old, and no longer a minor at the time of the judgment.

6       This is not the first divorce proceeding between the couple. 20 years ago, in December 1999, the wife had commenced another divorce proceeding against the husband, but it was withdrawn.

7       The wife commenced the present divorce proceedings in April 2018. The husband contested her case. The contested trial on the issue of divorce came for hearing on 29 January 2019 and continued on 28 March 2019. On 16 May 2019, the decision to issue an interim judgment dissolving the marriage was handed down. Both parties were represented by counsel at the trial.

## The Case for the Wife

8       The wife gave evidence. Her case is that throughout the marriage the husband has been a philanderer.

9       She testified that 5 years into the marriage, back in 1999, she discovered that her husband had been in a relationship with another woman, and she launched a divorce proceeding. She subsequently withdrew it. However, she claims, for a long time she felt that the husband has no love or feelings for her. Nevertheless, she persevered in the marriage for the sake of their only child, a daughter who had ambitions to be a doctor.

10     In November 2004 her husband was posted to Shanghai. She and the child relocated there and lived with him. In 2008, she and the child returned to Singapore. A few months later her husband, too, returned to Singapore, where he began to work for a new employer.

11     In June 2010, policemen showed up at their home in Singapore, and they enquired from her about her husband, allegedly because a lady had called them alleging that her husband had wanted to commit suicide.

12     Still in 2010, her husband was sent to Shanghai by his new employer. A few months later in 2011, her husband returned to Singapore.

13     In 2012, she overheard a conversation between her husband with a woman, YY, that her husband knew from a casino.

14     In 2013 her husband went to Shanghai to work for another employer. She and the child did not go with him to Shanghai, but remained in Singapore. Her husband promised her that he would not womanise.

15     In February 2017 she discovered emails between her husband and a woman, dated a few months earlier, between 18 August to 10 September 2016. These emails appeared to her to show that her husband was in a relationship with the woman.

16     In May 2017, during a short visit to Singapore by her husband, she confronted him about her discovery. She alleges that her husband remained silent. Since then, they have not spoken to each other.

17     In December 2017, her husband returned to Singapore from China and has been here since. In April 2018, she filed the writ of divorce for the present proceedings.

## The Case for the Husband

18     The husband’s case is that the wife has not proved her case. He submits that the wife pleaded and conducted her case in a haphazard manner, with sweeping statements, unsubstantiated allegations and loose language.

19     The husband asks the Court to scrutinise the wife’s case. In particular, he argues that her assertion that he had no love or feelings for her for a long time is contradicted by evidence that the couple went on family vacations together, and with their daughter.

20     The husband also takes issue with the accusation that he is a “philanderer” and had an “affair”. He points out that, by the plaintiff’s own admission, a philanderer is someone who is frequently involved in affairs, which entails having sexual relations with other women. On this, the wife has adduced no evidence of such behaviour.

21     The husband argues that the wife has conceded that some of her assertions are untrue – that he did not inform her of the reasons for his retrenchment of a previous employment, which he argues that the wife, whilst on the stand, suddenly admitted was untrue; and that he reduced his payment of maintenance to her because he was unremorseful, which he argues that the wife admitted to be the incorrect reason. He also argues that the wife’s allegation that he had been stationed in China for most of the marriage is untrue because, based on a totality of the time the husband spent in China, it added up to only 42% of the length of the marriage.

22     The husband submits that he had sacrificed to provide for the family, and this was in accordance with the parties’ agreed division of roles. He points out that counsel for the wife did not dispute that the husband had fulfilled his duties as a breadwinner. He also points out that in her testimony, the wife accepted that the family was able to maintain their standard of living because of the husband’s salary. The husband submits that all this is relevant as part of the behaviour that has reference to the marriage, and that he should not be punished for working to the bone in order to provide for the family he loves.

23     The husband submits that the evidence shows that the parties have a functioning marriage. There were happy occasions as featured in family photographs including one of Chinese New Year as recently as 2017. On that occasion, the wife described the occasion to the Court as a “happy occasion”. The photographs, he argues, chronicle memories over the 24 years of marriage, and are to be taken as a genuine depiction of the state of the parties’ relationship.

24     The husband submits that the parties used terms of endearment with each other, suggesting that they were on good terms.

25     The husband submits that he had put effort into maintaining communication with the wife and their child in spite of being physically apart. He would make an effort to remember and celebrate the wife’s birthdays and their anniversaries, discussed with her matters concerning the household, and kept her apprised of his work schedule as well as developments at work.

26     The husband submits that he maintained a good relationship with their child. This is admitted to by the wife.

27     The husband argues that the wife failed to prove her allegation that in 1999 he had had an affair with a Filipino air stewardess, which in any event, is irrelevant.

28     The husband denies that the wife was left very much to herself and to care for their child throughout the 4 years that the family lived in Shanghai from 2004 to 2008. He submits that there is no evidence to support this allegation. In any event, the relocation of the family to Shanghai was a joint decision of theirs.

29     The husband submits that the incident when policemen attended at their home in 2010 is irrelevant to the present case, and its averment unfair, given that the wife conceded that she did not know whether the husband had engaged in sexual intercourse with the mentioned woman.

30     The husband argues that the wife had never indicated she disapproved of his going to the casino, and as such cannot be a backdrop to the breakdown of the marriage.

31     The husband argues that the incident between him and YY was completely innocent and was a casual one-time encounter. It was merely blown out of proportion by the wife.

32     The husband claims that the wife’s allegation that he did not inform her of the reasons for leaving his previous employer is false. During the trial the wife conceded that she had in fact been made aware of the reason.

33     The husband claims that he was never made aware of the wife’s unhappiness over his posting to China. In particular, this is in response to the wife’s claims that the husband did not return to Singapore when she and their child was unwell, or when her father passed away. In this regard, during cross examination of the wife, the husband’s learned counsel established that the wife did inform the husband of these happenings, but she did not specifically request him to “drop his work to come back”. In any event, the husband points out, this issue was not pleaded.

34     Regarding the emails that the wife discovered, the husband contends that the wife misunderstood his close friendship with his yoga instructor in Shanghai, the person with whom the emails were exchanged. He submits that the emails from the yoga instructor cannot be relied upon to prove the truth of what they state. He submits that the emails from him do not accurately reflect his true state of mind and intentions at the time they were sent. The husband submits that the emails do not prove that he was a philanderer as they do not show that he was having sexual relations with the yoga instructor. He also submits that the emails must be read in the context of the Chinese culture under which they were made, where terms of endearment, he explained, are a tendency of Chinese society. He explained that it is not uncommon for such terms of endearment to be used widely in the Chinese society without any romantic intent, and do not evidence any intimate relationship. He also testified that the emails have to be read with the understanding that he was writing defensively in order to protect himself and his family’s welfare and safety.

35     The husband testified that he and the yoga instructor used to be close friends but are no longer in contact. She was his yoga instructor, and he was not in an intimate relationship with her. He admitted that he had been jealous observing her interactions with other students, but he testified that this arose out of their close friendship and his expectation to be the only, or one of the few, close students or disciples that she had. He testified that he later discovered that she had other close friendships with male friends and students, and finally, that she had a boyfriend. He testified that he then realised he had misunderstood the closeness of his friendship with her and this led him to express hurt and insecurity to her in the emails. He submits that the emails were from before September 2016 as he had cut off all ties with the yoga instructor in August 2016.

36     The husband also argues that the emails presented only a snapshot of his interactions with the yoga instructor. He argues that to rely on them does not provide a good picture of the state of affairs between him and the yoga instructor, and that they cannot be taken at face value also because he was in an unstable emotional state at the time they were composed.

37     The husband contends that he should be given a chance to make things right with his wife. He submits that there are bound to be ups and downs in every marriage, especially in a long one like his. This was acknowledged by the wife in cross-examination. He submits that these vicissitudes of marriage are a part of the vicissitudes of life.

38     The husband claims that the wife never once showed to him the emails or gave him a chance to explain them to her. This is admitted to by the wife. The couple continued to reside in the same home for more than 6 months before the commencement of these proceedings. His learned counsel submits that, under section 95(6) of the Women’s Charter, as the parties have continued to cohabit for a period of more than 6 months, this Court may have regard to the fact of the cohabitation and give appropriate weight to it. In this case, he submits that the Court should give little weight to the wife’s claim of unreasonable behaviour given the extended length of time in which the parties continued to reside together before the writ was filed.

## The emails

39     Extracts of the email communications that were seen by the wife need to be stated here in some detail. These extracts must be read with the fact in mind that the husband was writing to his yoga instructor in Shanghai. Only the emails from the husband are referred to herein.

> i.    “I am wrong too. When jealous, harsh words were uttered, words that hurt. I am at fault, I should not hurt the person I love. I have a request. Can you put me back on WeChat and not block my calls/messages? I promise not to harass you. Take good care of yourself. Miss you, love you.”

> ii.    “To address other men openly on Weibo (microblogging) as “dear”, and to say that you do not a \[sic\] boyfriend, do you think I’ll feel good? This is what I said about not considering how I feel! You treat me absolutely as a nobody, without sparing any thoughts for me! I am really speechless.”

> iii.  “The matter has gone out of control. I made the decision after discussing with my family member(s), not out of impulse. Not letting you come back to me, this is now impossible. I told my mum this afternoon you dumped my clothes, she got angry: because according to Singapore Chinese customs, one’s clothes are dumped only when the person passes away. I am not dead yet. Shanghai to me is no longer a lucky place, she wants me to go back to Singapore quickly. On August 11, I told her about your family’s requirement(s), then she said, tell me to purchase a small house in Anhui (province) for your parents, but the house in Shanghai is to have two persons’ names, the house in Singapore may also (change) from just my one name to two persons’ names. This is more reasonable, she hopes you will accept it.”

> iv.    “All my kindness, care, concern and love for you during the past 19 months seem inexistent now, carry no weight, and cannot make up for the fault from those few days. You have known me for 19 months, why did I change from an understanding and approachable person to one who overreacts? My love for you has deepened gradually over these 19 months, it is ever increasing and never decreasing, from a single parent with no wish to get married to a prisoner of love who cannot live without you. Even with my family members opposing, I have already been thinking about the details of our marriage, But you are often indifferent to me, like I am dispensable, and this is particularly obvious in the recent two months. All along, all that you did and said, you have never spared a thought for me, as if I am a nobody, I have no feelings.

> ….

> We have been together for 19 months, it is the first time I uttered words that hurt you badly, words are \[sic\] that very wrong, and you want to force me to a dead end, irrecoverably? For the 19 months that I have been kind to you, truthfully in love with you and deeply caring for you, none of these could make up for the words wrongly spoken, or are worthy of your forgiveness? The mistake I made was an abrupt one, without violating any principles, I do not think we won’t have a future, the love between us can be re-cultivated gradually, if only you are willing.”

> v.    “2. Why didn’t you publicise your illness? Or say you are not ill? Or do you want me to post a WeChat screenshot to prove everything?

> 3.    You told me to write those things previously (at that time, we would address each other as “darling hubby”, “darling wifey”.) I can post these conversations.

> 4\. To quote you, “Love and hate are momentary, I am no longer what I used to be”. I will pour all out word for word. I have said before, the entire matter can be easily resolved, but you have been very arrogant and supercilious, making things worse, to the point of no return. Even if you don’t take me as a lover, you can take me as a friend or relative, yet you treat me as a foe, an enemy!”

> vi.    “You were different, you immediately dumped all my things, talked bad about me, telling everyone, to the point of no return. My mum told me to return all the things to you, your yoga attire plus other stuff, every piece of it, and not to throw away.”

40     In addition, there is another email where the husband lists items that he had purchased for the yoga instructor which comprise:

> i.     Chanel bag,

> ii.     Celine bag,

> iii.     Redline bracelet,

> iv.     Jimmy Choo shoes,

> v.     Helmut Lang trousers,

> vi.     A+F clothes,

> vii.     Lulu lemon yoga apparel,

> viii.     Nike yoga apparel,

> ix.     Nike running shoes,

> x.     ASH casual footwear,

> xi.     PURE Yoga card valued at RMB 11,000, and

> xii.     IAPM beauty card valued at RMB 23,000.

41     The husband also mentioned that he paid rent for the month of August for the yoga instructor in the sum of RMB 11,000.

## Applicable Legal Principles

42     In the Women’s Charter, section 95 (3) states that “the Court hearing any proceedings for divorce shall not hold a marriage to have broken down irretrievably unless the plaintiff satisfies the court of one of more of the following fact: … (b) that the defendant has behaved in such a way that the plaintiff cannot reasonably be expected to live with the defendant”.

43     What constitutes behaviour that a spouse cannot reasonably be expected to live with is a matter of fact that depends on the circumstances of each particular case. This was stated by the High Court in _Wong Siew Boey v Lee Boon Fatt_[^1]. What this Court needs to consider is whether or not the behaviour of the husband is such that the wife cannot reasonably be expected to live with, as a finding of fact, without categorising such behaviour as blameworthy or guilty; that the cumulative effect of the behaviour of the husband can be considered, and the behaviour is not confined to behaviour towards the wife, but can include behaviour towards other members of the family or outsiders so long as it has reference to the marriage.

44     In _Teo Hoon Ping v Tan Lay Ying Angeline_[^2], the High Court stated as follows –

> “The test for determining whether a spouse has behaved in such a way that the spouse cannot reasonably be expected to live with him or her was laid down in the case of _Wong Siew Boey v Lee Boon Fatt_. This test requires the court to ask if the plaintiff, with his or her characteristics and personality, with his or her faults and other attributed, good and bad, and having regard to his or her behaviour during the marriage, can reasonably be expected to live with the defendant.

> The test as stated is an objective one that requires the court to take into account the subjective qualities of the plaintiff. There appears to be no local case that has directly addressed the issue of whether the reasons for the defendant having acted as he did should be a factor in determining the reasonableness of his behaviour.

> Both a literal reading of s 95(3)(b) of the Women’s Charter as well as the test in _Wong Siew Boey_ suggest that the focus of the analysis should be on whether the defendant’s behaviour was so unreasonable that the union has become impossible, rather than on any consideration of blameworthiness. Although it is common to describe s95(3)(b) as allowing for the dissolution of marriage due to unreasonable behaviour, this is a misnomer. Section 95(3)(b) deals only with behaviour that is sufficiently grave for the court to conclude that one party cannot reasonably be expected to live with the other. Hence, the reasons for the defendant’s behaviour are secondary to the question of whether it is reasonable to expect a plaintiff to continue living with him or her.”

## Issues

45     Based on the facts and the law, the issues of the case to be decided by the Court are as follows -

> a.     Did the husband behave as alleged by the wife?

> b.     If so, is this a behaviour that the wife cannot reasonably be expected to live with him?

> c.     Did the couple cohabit for a period of more than 6 months after the date of the occurrence of the final incident relied upon by the wife? If so, should that fact be regarded in determining whether or not the wife can reasonably be expected to live with the husband?

> d.     Is there a possibility of reconciliation between them?

## Findings

## Did the husband behave as alleged by the wife?

46     It is found, on a balance of probabilities, that the husband was not a philanderer. The plain and ordinary meaning of the term philanderer is a person who has promiscuous sexual trysts. However, it is not the wife’s case that the husband had committed sexual acts with anyone else at all, so this makes the use of the term inaccurate and inelegant. There is no evidence that the husband has had sexual relations with any other person.

47     It is found, on a balance of probabilities, that the emails from the husband show that he had romantic affections towards the woman he sent them to. He does not deny that the emails were his. In them, he used the terms “dear” towards the woman. He declared that his “love” for her had “deepened gradually over these 19 months, it is ever increasing and never decreasing”. He described himself as a “prisoner of love who cannot live without (her), and that he had been “thinking about the details of (their) marriage. He ended off one email with “Miss you, love you.”.

## Is this a behaviour that the wife cannot reasonably be expected to live with the husband?

48     Whether or not the phrases used by the husband in the emails are genuinely indicative of the husband’s true feelings towards the woman, it must have been devastating to be read by the wife. The husband did not attempt to explain to her the cultural context that he tried to give to this court. If indeed his case is true, a reasonable person would expect him to have explained it to the wife immediately. He did not. He did not even plead this in his Defence. He does not adduce any further conversations he had with the woman which could show the alleged innocent context that he claims. He did not call the woman to come to court to explain the conversations to confirm what he claims. If the words in the emails were meant to convey any meaning other than their plain and ordinary one, then it is for the husband to prove it. He has not done so. The conclusion that this Court is left to draw is that the husband’s explanation was an afterthought, and on a balance of probabilities, untrue. There is no special cultural context to be applied when reading the emails, they are thus to be read in their plain and patent meaning.

49     Applying the reasoning of _Teo Hoon Ping_, then even if it is accepted that the husband’s defence that his behaviour is reflective of the culture in the country that he was in, the behaviour ought still be treated as not reasonable to expect the wife to live with. The effect of s95(3)(b) can be described as being spouse-centric. In other words, it may be that the husband’s behaviour is acceptable in some other context or to some other persons. Yet the only question to be asked is whether the behaviour is one that is reasonable to expect the spouse – his spouse in particular - to live with. In the circumstances of this case, it cannot be said to be reasonable to expect the wife to accept and live with him.

## Did the parties live with each other for a period of more than 6 months after the date of the occurrence of the final incident relied upon by the wife? If so, should that fact be regarded in determining whether or not the wife can reasonably be expected to live with the husband?

50     The husband raised the issue of whether or not the couple had continued to live together for more than 6 months after the date of the occurrence of the final incident relied on by the wife. The relevant provision is S95(6) of the Women’s Charter –

> **95\. (6**)    Where the plaintiff alleges that the defendant has behaved in such a way that the plaintiff cannot reasonably be expected to live with him, but the parties to the marriage have lived with each other for a period or periods after the date of the occurrence of the final incident relied on by the plaintiff and held by the court to support his allegation, that fact shall be disregarded in determining for the purposes of subsection (3)(b) whether the plaintiff cannot reasonably be expected to live with the defendant if the length of that period or of those periods together was 6 months or less.

51     The wife discovered the emails in February 2017. At that time, the husband was residing in Shanghai. The husband came home in December 2017. The writ was filed on 26 April 2018. That would be more than a year after the discovery of the emails, but less than 6 months from the return of the husband to the matrimonial home.

52     This defence was not expressly pleaded by the husband. It was not addressed as such during the examination of the parties. It was not presented as part of the husband’s case. It must have been within the knowledge of the husband at all material times. This in itself ought to be sufficient for the issue to be disregarded, or to be treated as admitted by the husband. Nevertheless, for completeness of adjudication, the issue will be examined.

53     To apply S95(6), what first needs to be determined is when the “date of the occurrence of the _final_ incident relied on by the plaintiff” was. The final incident is clearly not the date of the wife’s discovery of the emails, but the date when the husband returned to Singapore and was confronted by the wife about the emails, which was in May 2017.

54     The second question is, whether after the date of the final incident, did the wife live with the husband for more than 6 months. The answer is she did not.

55     Even according to the husband, after the confrontation about the emails, the wife engaged “radio silence” towards him. Also according to him, he did not attempt to re-establish communication or connection with her. The couple did not share a bedroom, they did not eat together, and she did not cook for him[^3]. This shows that the wife could not accept the husband’s behaviour and did not live with it. There is no evidence to show that she condoned or tolerated or forgave, even temporarily, the behaviour complained of. Her circumstances must be taken into account as well, that the husband was the sole breadwinner and there is no evidence that she could have left for another abode.

56     In any event, the husband only came home in December 2017, less than 6 months before the writ was filed. The wife continued to estrange him, even when the writ was filed on 26 April 2018.

57     Therefore, it is found that the wife behaved if she was no longer married to the husband since the discovery of the emails. She resided in the matrimonial home, but did not live with him in the marital sense after the final incident for more than 6 months.

58     Even if the wife is considered as having lived with the husband for more than 6 months after the final incident, it is still open for the wife to rely on the ground of unreasonable behaviour. This is contrasted with S95(5) which deals with parties living together for more than 6 months after the discovery of the adultery –

> **95\. (5)(b**)    if the length of that period or of those periods together exceeded 6 months, the plaintiff _shall not be entitled_ to rely on that adultery for the purposes of subsection (3)(a).

59     It can be seen that the Women’s Charter prescribes different standards of reactions expected of different types grounds of divorce. For adultery, the plaintiff must find it _intolerable_ to live with the defendant; whereas in unreasonable behaviour, the plaintiff _cannot reasonably be expected_ to live with the defendant.

60     The difference extends to the provision regarding the plaintiff living with the defendant after discovering the adultery or unreasonable behaviour. For adultery, if the parties continue to live with each other for more than 6 months, then the plaintiff is not entitled to rely on the ground of adultery altogether. For unreasonable behaviour, it is not absolutely fatal to the plaintiff’s case, instead it is left to the court to decide on whether or not the continued living together defeats or mitigates how reasonable it would be to expect the plaintiff to live with the defendant.

61     On an examination of the facts of the case, even if it can be said that the wife continued to live with the husband for more than 6 months after the final incident, her case of unreasonable behaviour is not defeated. The wife’s continued residency with the husband was evidently precipitated out of necessity and lack of options. The wife’s behaviour in that period does not show any acceptance or forgiveness of the husband’s behaviour.

## Is there a possibility of reconciliation between the parties?

62     S49 of the Women’s Charter provides that

> (1)    A court before which —

>> (a)    proceedings for divorce or judicial separation;

>> (b)    proceedings, instituted by a party to a subsisting marriage, under section 59, 65, 66 or 69,

> are being heard shall consider, from time to time, the possibility of a reconciliation of the parties.

> (2)    If, during such proceedings, it appears to the judge from the nature of the case, the evidence in the proceedings or the attitude of the parties that there is a reasonable possibility of a reconciliation of the parties, the judge may do all or any of the following:

>> (a)    adjourn the proceedings to give the parties the opportunity to consider a reconciliation or to enable anything to be done in accordance with paragraph (b) or (c);

>> (b)    with the consent of the parties, interview them in chambers, with or without their solicitors, as the judge thinks proper, to assist in a possible reconciliation; and

>> (c)    nominate a Conciliation Officer or some other suitable person or organisation to assist in considering a possible reconciliation.

63     The possibility of reconciliation was considered. It is found that there is none. The couple had undergone a similar event in 1999 that led to the wife launching a divorce proceeding against the husband. That case was withdrawn, and it is evident that the couple reconciled. This second gashing of the old wound makes it unlikely that reconciliation is possible. The Court noted that the parties’ attitudes were utterly not compromising; the wife was insistent on ending the marriage, and the husband was in vehement denial of his behaviour. In any case, the avenues for conciliation counselling have been available to the parties at the early stages of divorce proceedings.

64     On this same issue of the possibility of reconciliation, is the husband’s submission that the parties still have a functioning marriage correct? Indeed, there were happy occasions as featured in family photographs including one of Chinese New Year as recently as 2017. On that occasion, the wife described the occasion as a “happy occasion”. The photographs, the husband argues, chronicle memories over the 24 years of marriage, and are to be taken as a genuine depiction of the state of the parties’ relationship. The husband also submits that the parties used terms of endearment with each other, suggesting that they were on good terms.

65     It is to be noted, however, that all these evidence the happiness of the wife and her attitude towards the husband before her discovery of the emails. The last use of a term of endearment by the wife was also before her discovery of the emails.

66     Therefore, these do not show that the parties had a functioning marriage after the wife’s discovery of the emails in February 2017.

## Conclusion

67     Under the Women’s Charter, S95(2),

> The court hearing such proceedings shall, so far as it reasonably can, inquire into the facts alleged as causing or leading to the breakdown of the marriage and, if satisfied that the circumstances make it just and reasonable to do so, grant a judgment for its dissolution.

68     On a balance of probabilities, the wife’s case is proved. The marriage between the parties has broken down irretrievably due to the behaviour of the husband. There is no possibility of reconciliation. There are no minor children. For these reasons, it is just and reasonable to grant a judgment to dissolve the marriage.
