variation – maintenance of children – change in circumstances

5 November 2019

### District Judge Jinny Tan:

## Introduction

1       Parties were married on xxx 2012. There are two children to the marriage, one child is 7 years old and the other child is 3 years old.

2       The Plaintiff commenced divorce proceedings on 11 October 2017, based on the Defendant’s behaviour. There was an agreement between parties on the divorce as well as the various ancillary matters, and the divorce proceedings were filed on the simplified track.

3       Interim Judgment was granted on 31 October 2017, and the Final Judgment was obtained on 1 February 2018.

4       The relevant terms of the Interim Judgment which parties had consented to were as follows:-

> _“3a_      _The Plaintiff and the Defendant have joint custody of the children of the marriage …… with care and control be given to the Plaintiff; and_

>> _b_      _liberal access be given to the Defendant._

>> _…._

>> _f_      _that the Defendant shall contribute to the maintenance of the 2 children of the marriage in this manner and amount:-_

>>> _a_)     _Continuing to pay $1,000.00 for both children’s child-care services directly to the child-care centres;_

>>> _b_)     _When the eldest child enters primary school, to pay $1,000.00 monthly on the 1st day of each calendar month by GIRO into a bank account to be maintained by the Plaintiff (“the said account”);_

>>> _c_)     _When the eldest child enters secondary school, to pay $1,300.00 monthly by GIRO on the 1st each day of calendar month into the said account.”_

5       The Defendant filed an application (Summons 2622/2019) on 1 August 2019, to vary Paragraph 3(f) of Interim Judgment. She sought the following variation:-

> a)     She does not need to pay $1,000 for the children’s childcare services for November 2018 and December 2018;

> b)     She does not need to pay $1,000 monthly from January 2019 to July 2019;

> c)     The Plaintiff is to contribute $500 per month for the children from June 2019 or any reasonable sum;

> d)     Alternatively, this paragraph of Interim Judgment to be rescinded.

## Orders made

6       After hearing arguments, on 11 October 2019, I dismissed the Defendant’s application in its entirety, and also ordered costs to be paid by her in the sum of $2,000 to the Plaintiff.

## Appeal

7       The Defendant has filed an appeal against my decision on 11 October 2019.

8       I therefore now give my reasons for the decision which I had given.

## Background –

### Interim Judgment and the applications filed prior to Summons 2622/2019

#### Interim Judgment 31 October 2017

9       The divorce proceedings between the parties were on the simplified track. Parties had been able to come to an agreement on the divorce as well as the various ancillary matters prior to the filing of the divorce proceedings.

10     As part of the documentation filed for the simplified divorce proceedings, a draft Consent Order was exhibited in the Statement of Particulars. The draft Consent Order was signed by the Defendant before a Commissioner for Oaths one Mr Kannan SG. Interim Judgment was granted on 31 October 2017, and the Court also approved the terms set out in the draft Consent Order.

#### Summons 3188/2018

11     The Defendant filed Summons 3188/2018 on 6 September 2018, for the orders relating to the ancillary matters in the Interim Judgment be set aside on the basis of “misrepresentation and duress by the Plaintiff and/or mistake by one or both parties” and for the ancillary matters to be remitted back to the Court for determination.

12     In the application, the Defendant’s main case is that she was misled, misrepresented and/or lied to by the Plaintiff and/or his lawyers into agreeing and signing the draft consent order, which was later approved and incorporated into the Interim Judgment.

13     After hearing arguments, I dismissed it on 13 May 2019 as I found that there were no grounds for the order to be set aside.

#### Summons 119/2019

14     The Plaintiff filed an application on 10 January 2019, to ask for an injunction, to stop the Defendant from interfering in the care of the two children and to stop the Defendant from doing anything to stop the children from continuing with their child-care.

15     The Plaintiff’s application arose due to certain incidents that happened in relation to the child-care as well as the conflict between the Defendant and the Plaintiff’s mother. The Defendant had tried to take their daughter out of the childcare in Tampines. She also threatened not to return the children to the Plaintiff should he let his mother visit the children or care for the children.

16     I dismissed the Plaintiff’s application.

#### “Liberal access” clause in the Interim Judgment

17     From the affidavits filed, it was apparent that the problems parties were facing in relation to the care/access arrangement of the children arose because of the vagueness in the access which the Defendant was allowed to have under the Interim Judgment.

18     The Interim Judgment provided that the Defendant was to be granted “liberal access”. Both parties had different ideas of what this entailed and therefore resulted in the various applications filed by both parties.

19     For example, one of the problems cited by the Defendant in her affidavit was that the Plaintiff controlled how she could exercise access to the children and set his own terms and conditions in respect of who the children could see and what she should do if she wanted access. She needed to seek his permission if she wanted to see the children on weekends.

20     She was of the view that the Plaintiff spent very little time with the children as he returned home in the wee hours of the mornings on most evenings. She therefore wanted to set aside the care and control orders in the Interim Judgment and seek shared care and control instead. This is so that she can care for the children during the weekdays (if the Plaintiff is unable to do so) and there can be regularity in the weekend access.

21     The Defendant tried to take their daughter out of the childcare in Tampines was because the Plaintiff had changed the childcare without consulting the Defendant.

22     On specific occasions raised by the Plaintiff when their daughter did not go to childcare, the Defendant explained that she wanted to spend time with her daughter. It was not because the Defendant had the intention of permanently taking their daughter out from the childcare in Tampines.

23     In the affidavits, the Defendant also raised her objection with the Plaintiff’s mother having regular and close contact with her children. She did not want the Plaintiff’s mother to be caring for the children and instead, she herself was available and willing to care for them herself should the Plaintiff not be able to.

24     To assist parties, I allowed parties to address the Court on the specific timings of the access, so that the “liberal access” can be defined and both parties can have the same expectation of the times in which the Defendant is allowed to spend with the children. This allowed for parties not to waste time and money in filing a separate application to vary the “liberal access” clause in the Interim Judgment.

#### 4 July 2019 Court Order

25     After hearing parties, I made orders on 4 July 2019. Effectively, the children would be able to stay with the Defendant over the weekend twice a month. She also has access 3 times a week on weekdays after school to 8:30pm. She will also have alternate public holiday access, and half of the school holidays.

## Current application – Summons 2622/2019 (“Defendant’s Summons”)

#### Prayer 2 of the Defendant’s Summons - Issue had already been dealt with in Summons 3188/2018

26     The Defendant, by way of Prayer 2 of the Defendant’s Summons, asks for the rescission of Paragraph 3f of the Interim Judgment (which relates to the maintenance to be paid by her for the children’s maintenance).

27     The issue of rescission of the ancillary matters orders in the Interim Judgment had already been dealt with in Summons 3188/2018. The ancillary matters orders which she sought to set aside in Summons 3188/2018 relate to the division of assets, maintenance for the children, and the children’s care and control arrangements.

28     In her affidavit supporting Summons 3188/2018, she raised her objections about the maintenance she had consented to contribute, and how she had not anticipated additional expenses picking up and sending the children home on weekdays and the purchase of various items for the children. She also queried about the children’s reasonable expenses and the apportionment of the expenses to be borne by parties.

29     The Defendant therefore cannot rehash and re-open the issue of rescission of the ancillary orders of the Interim Judgment. This is tantamount to a back-door appeal against my decision in relation to Summons 3188/2018.

30     Therefore Prayer 2 of the Defendant’s Summons is dismissed.

#### Prayer 1(a) of the Defendant’s Summons - Issue relates to a set-off and not a variation

31     The Defendant, by way of Prayer 1(a) of the Defendant’s Summons, asks for an order that she does not need to pay $1,000 for the children’s childcare services for November and December 2018.

32     In her affidavit in support, she explained that she did not make payment of $1,000 for the children’s childcare services in November and December 2018 because she had made payment for various other items and the Plaintiff did not account for the monies he had taken and he had not reimbursed her as agreed[^1].

33     She explained that the Plaintiff had defaulted on payment of the children’s Chinese language tuition at xxx, and there was an agreement with the Plaintiff that he would pay for the children’s childcare while she paid for the Chinese tuition at xxx. She also explained that there were other items which the Plaintiff had agreed to reimburse her for, which she had paid and also the Plaintiff had withdrawn some monies in their joint account.

34     Based on the Defendant’s explanation, she is seeking a set-off.

35     Any set-off is relevant in relation to any enforcement proceedings should the Plaintiff take in relation to the default in maintenance payment by the Defendant.

36     The Defendant therefore, is incorrect to apply for a downward variation in respect of the November and December 2018 maintenance.

37     I therefore dismissed Paragraph 1a of the Defendant’s Summons.

#### Paragraphs 1b, c and 3 of the Defendant’s Summons - Variation of the amount of maintenance sought is unclear

38     From the outset, the variation sought by the Defendant in Paragraphs 1b and c of the Defendant’s Summons is not clear.

39     A plain reading of Paragraph 1b of the Defendant’s Summons would mean that the Defendant wants the Court to order that she does not pay the ordered sum from January 2019 to July 2019. But what happens from August 2019? Does she intend to continue paying the ordered sum from August 2019?

40     A plain reading of Paragraph 1c of the Defendant’s Summons would mean that the Defendant wants the Court to order that the Plaintiff to contribute $500 per month from June 2019 into an account designated by her. Is this sum meant to be maintenance of the children and is to be over and on top of what the Plaintiff has been paying for?

41     Upon clarification at the hearing, the Defendant’s counsel clarified that what the Defendant wanted was for her not to pay any maintenance for the children from January 2019 and instead for the Plaintiff to pay her $500 per month from June 2019 for the children’s maintenance. Counsel also clarified that what the Defendant is asking for is a downward variation of the maintenance that she had been ordered to pay and for this she relies on prayer 3 of her summons where the Defendant prayed for “_further and/or other orders or relief deemed fit by the Honourable Court_.”

42     The Defendant ought to have made it clear in her Summons, how she wanted the maintenance orders to be varied, instead of leaving it so vague and relying on Paragraph 3.

43     The Plaintiff appears to understand the gist of what the Defendant was asking for, as the Plaintiff’s reply affidavit dealt with the reasons why a variation should not be allowed, the children’s expenses, their respective incomes etc. So, his affidavit substantially dealt with the various relevant issues in a typical application for a downward variation of maintenance.

## The Defendant’s case – material change in circumstances

44     From the outset, the Defendant’s Counsel confirmed that the financial circumstances of the parties have remained the same, between the time when the Interim Judgment was made and now. The change in circumstances is the access she has with the children.

45     The Defendant’s case is that prior to September 2018, the Plaintiff restricted her access to the children. After she filed her Summons 3188/2018, she insisted on more access time with the children although the Plaintiff did not allow her continuous access on weekends or to take the children to her place of residence when her partner was around.

46     After December 2018, the Defendant was allowed to have overnight access on alternate weekends. She was also taking care of the children when the Plaintiff had to travel overseas. She also picked up the children from school and even had access on some Saturday afternoons.

47     After 4 July 2019, her access timings became better defined and she was then able to spend more time with the children.

48     Her expenses on the children therefore increased substantially with the increase in her access times.

49     In order to accommodate the children during the overnight access, she rented a condominium with two bedrooms and moved out of her earlier studio apartment.

## The Plaintiff’s case – no change in circumstances

50     The Plaintiff’s case is that there has been no material change in circumstances to warrant any variation of the maintenance orders in the Interim Judgment.

51     The Defendant had liberal access to the children since October 2017. There has not been any change to that. Any parent with access to the children will have to feed and nurture the children as these are the children’s basic necessities during the access. If the Defendant wishes to indulge the children, that is her prerogative and does not reflect any adverse or material change in circumstances.

52     The Plaintiff continues to have sole care and control of the children, bearing the bulk of the children’s day-to-day living and schooling expenses.

53     Moreover, parties had reached an agreement on the maintenance to be paid by the Defendant, and the Defendant cannot now re-open the issue to question the Plaintiff’s finances and assets and the expenses of the children.

## The Law

54     The law in relation to the variation of maintenance for children is governed by Section 72 and 73 of the Women’s Charter. Sections 72 and 73 of the Women’s Charter provide as follows: -

> _72(1_)     _On the application of any person receiving or ordered to pay a monthly allowance under this Part and on proof of a change in the circumstances of that person, his wife or child, or for other good cause being shown to the satisfaction of the court, the court by which the order was made may rescind the order or may vary it as it thinks fit._

> (_2_)     _Without prejudice to the extent of the discretion conferred upon the court by subsection (1), the court may, in considering any application made under this section, take into consideration any change in the general cost of living which may have occurred between the date of the making of the order sought to be varied and the date of the hearing of the application._

> _73_.     _The court may, at any time and from time to time, vary the terms of any agreement relating to the maintenance of a child… notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in that agreement, where it is satisfied that it is reasonable and for the welfare of the child to do so.”_

55     In _AYM v. AYL[^2]_, the Court of Appeal held that section 73 of the Women’s Charter is wide enough to encompass a material change in the circumstance of the parents as a basis for varying the maintenance for the child. The court may vary agreements for maintenance where it is satisfied that there has been a material change in circumstances. The circumstances in question must be those prevailing at the time the agreement for maintenance was entered into. Therefore, the material changes (which any party seeking to vary an agreement for maintenance must show) must relate to those circumstances.

56     In _Tan Sue Ann Melisa v. Lim Siang Bok_[^3], the Court of Appeal stated that “generally, the phrase “material change” is understood in the light of the factors that determine the initial award of maintenance.

57     It is also stated in _Law and Practice of Family Law in Singapore_ (Foo Siew Fong gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell Asia 2016) at \[7.4.35\] that:-

> _“What constitutes material change justifying a variation of an agreement for maintenance necessitates a comparison of the present circumstances of the parties with the circumstances when they entered into the agreement. Where an upcoming material change was expected to happen and known to the parties at the time of making the agreement, the party agreeing to pay cannot then make use of such a change in circumstances to later seek variation of the maintenance agreement.”_

58     It is trite law that a variation will be disallowed if the change in circumstances is self-induced[^4]. In _Tan Huan Eng Agnes Florence v. Trevor Symes[^5]_, District Judge Lim Hui Min explained what a material change in circumstances is:-

> _“A material change in circumstances has to be an adverse change in circumstances on the part of the payee – for example, an increase in expense due to illness or unemployment. A mere change in circumstances which does not result in a material adverse change for the payee is not relevant. A variation will not be allowed if the adverse change in circumstances is self-induced – for example if the payee deliberately resigns from a job and thus does not have any more income. ….”_

## No material change in circumstances

59     The Defendant’s case is that there has been a material change in circumstances in respect of the timing of the access that she has with the children.

60     In the Interim Judgment, parties had agreed for the Defendant to have “liberal access”. This meant that the Defendant had a choice of how often and regularly she wanted to exercise her access.

61     In her affidavit in support of Summons 3188/2018[^6], she alleged that the Plaintiff had restricted her access to the children:-

> _“27_.     _… It cannot be in the interest of the children and myself to be restricted to only weekday access and in such a manner…… it cannot be in their welfare to spend most of their time with the maid and without the presence of either parent. I strongly believe that my children should spend at least half of their time with their natural mother given their tender ages._

62     She thought she would be given unfettered contact and time with the children[^7].

> _“75_.     _…. I had been misled into believing that liberal access would give me unfettered contact and time with my children and the right to be involved in their lives.”_

63     Believing that she would get unfettered contact and time with her children, the Defendant also agreed to contribute towards the children’s maintenance as set out in Paragraph 3(f) of the Interim Judgment.

64     Prior to making the 4 July 2019 Order in relation to the specific timings of the access, I asked parties to communicate with each other to try to agree on the timings of the access to be given to the Defendant, and if the parties could not reach an agreement, the parties to file their respective affidavits on this issue. The Defendant, in her affidavit, set out the timings of access and the conditions which she wanted[^8].

65     In terms of the timings of the access which were finally ordered on 4 July 2019, most were in accordance with the Defendant’s wishes.

66     Therefore, the access that the Defendant had hoped to get under the original agreement (i.e. unfettered access) and the access that she obtained after 4 July 2019 were substantially the same, there is no material change.

67     The Defendant cannot rely on the fact that she had restricted access as the basis for comparison with the present situation to argue that there had been a material change. This is because when parties came to an agreement on the maintenance of the children (which subsequently was recorded as a term in the Interim Judgment), she did not have restricted access. In her own affidavit in support of Summons 3188/2018, it is her evidence that the restriction of access started after Final Judgment was granted[^9]:-

> _18_.     _After the Final Judgment was granted, the Plaintiff’s attitude changed vis-à-vis my access. He controlled how I could exercise access to the children and set his own terms and conditions in respect of who the children can see and what I should do if I want access. He has apparently also started dating and has very little time for the children as he would only return home in the wee hours of the morning on most evenings. He would spend his weekends with the children when he does not work and I would have to seek his permission if I wanted to see my children on weekends.”_

68     In any event, the 4 July 2019 order was made so that there was certainty in both parties’ expectation on the access to be given to the Defendant, so as to minimise any conflict between the parties. The vagueness of the “liberal access” clause was making the access order unworkable and caused problems for both parties.

69     Access to the children is a right given to the Defendant, since she is not the parent with care and control. If she does not wish to exercise her right of access and does not wish to see the children based on the timings ordered in the 4 July 2019, she can choose not to.

70     The Defendant’s counsel submitted that the Defendant will be held in contempt if she did not have access to the children on the times ordered. This is incorrect. The access parent, if he/she chooses to exercise access as regulated under any Court order, must be given access by the care and control parent. If the care and control parent does not give access, the care and control parent will be in contempt of court. If the access parent chooses not to exercise access, the only consequence is that he/she does not spend time with the children, and he/she would have wasted an opportunity to bond with the children and that would be ultimately his/her own loss.

### Change is self-induced

71     The Defendant claims that her expenses have increased as a result of her spending more time with the children.

72     This is a choice that the Defendant has made. She chose to spend more time with the children and chose to spend more money on the children or supposedly for the children’s benefit. It is good she wants to spend more time with the children, and it is good that she wants to let the children have some luxuries. Any increase in her expenses as a result of her spending more money on the children is therefore self-induced.

73     Access is the time given to the Defendant for the Defendant to spend time with the children to bond with the children. If she wants to be extravagant to the children and indulge them during their time with her, that is something that she does it out of unconditional love and the goodness of her heart.

74     If she cannot afford to pay for the luxuries for her children, she has a choice not to indulge, or to spend less and concentrate on spending quality time with the children on activities which do not require much money.

75     For example if she chooses to take the children for holiday, that is her choice and she has to pay for it herself. The Plaintiff will similarly pay for his own holidays that he takes with the children.

76     The Defendant chose to rent a bigger apartment for herself and her partner. That is the choice she and her spouse made, and they made the choice because they wanted the children to have a room when they stay over. This is not a necessity, but an indulgence which they choose to spend on. The children already have a permanent place of residence with the Plaintiff. Since the Defendant wanted to have overnight access, she has to make sure she has the ability and space to allow this to happen. She should not use this as a reason to reduce the maintenance that she was supposed to pay.

77     The Defendant also says she is paying for her aunt to help care for the children. Access is a time for her to spend with the children. If she is unable to be there with the children, she can choose not to exercise her access. She should not be asking her aunt to take her place during her access time with the children, let alone use this as a reason to reduce the maintenance that she was supposed to pay and instead seek reimbursement from the Plaintiff for the payment to her aunt.

78     The Defendant should not see the children as an expense to her and rely on the fact that she is spending more money on the children during access as a reason to seek a reduction in her maintenance obligations. She has a choice in all of this – how much to spend, what to do with the children during access, how often she wishes to see the children. All these are within her control.

79     Therefore, I found that if there had been an increase in her own expenses, these were self-induced and it does not warrant a downward variation of the maintenance payable by her.

## Plaintiff (care and control parent) to pay $500 per month to the Defendant (parent with access)?

80     It is the duty of both parents to maintain or contribute to the maintenance of their children. In the usual situation, the parent who has sole care and control of the children, will receive some contribution of maintenance from the other parent who has access to the children.

81     Here, the parties had agreed for the Plaintiff to have sole care and control of the children, with the Defendant having access to the children. This means that the Plaintiff is the primary person taking care of the children and will be the primary person making payment of the children’s various expenses. The Defendant, who is the parent with access, has a duty to contribute towards the children’s expenses.

82     The Defendant counsel confirms that there are no cases decided by the court wherein the parent with care and control of the children pays a monthly contribution to the parent having access to the children.

83     It also does not make sense for the parent who has access to the children to be paid a sum to pay for the expenses he/she incurs when the children are with him/her. If this is allowed, it may result in commoditizing the access time in that parents (who have access to the children) who may not have the genuine intention of wanting to spend time with the children but using the children to obtain some form of payment from the care and control parent.

84     During her access with the children, the Defendant is free to decide how she wishes to spend that time with the children. The Plaintiff cannot dictate what she can or cannot do with the children during her period of access. In the same token, the Plaintiff cannot be asked to pay for expenses incurred which he has no say in when the children are with the Defendant. She cannot expect the Plaintiff to sponsor her and help pay for the expenses which she chooses to spend on the children when the children are with her.

85     Moreover, the Defendant is not a babysitter, who is paid to look after the children. She is the children’s mother. Caring for the children is not a business transaction where she expects to be reimbursed for her efforts. Her wanting to see the children should come from her genuine love for the children and the genuine want on her part to spend time and build a bond with them.

86     Therefore, I found that there was no basis for the Defendant to seek payment from the Plaintiff to contribute to her expenses during her access with the children.

87     Therefore I dismissed the Defendant’s application in its entirety.

## Costs

88     As the Defendant’s application is dismissed in its entirety, I awarded the Plaintiff costs fixed at $2,000.

## Conclusion

89     Even though the Final Judgment was extracted in February 2018, parties have been embroiled in acrimonious litigation since September 2018 when Summons 3188/2018 was first filed by the Defendant. Since then, there had been various applications filed. The Plaintiff filed Summons 119/2019, and there were also applications to strike out portions of the Defendant’s affidavits and even an application for the recusal of a district judge.

90     Many affidavits have been filed by both parties, and the contents of the affidavits are unfriendly and antagonistic, making allegations not only against each other but also extended family members.

91     The Defendant has also commenced proceedings in the State Court against the Plaintiff and the Plaintiff counsel[^10].

92     The dispute between the parties is now no longer just about the parties, but it has now involved the Plaintiff’s counsel.

93     The parties have a choice – they can choose to continue being embroiled in litigation or they can choose to move on with their life, put what had happened behind them and focus on what they seem to say is the important thing in their lives – their children.

94     If parties want to continue being embroiled in litigation, they need to be prepared that legal costs will be incurred and if their applications are unmeritorious, costs will be awarded against them. They therefore, have to be aware of the costs implications and be certain of the merits of their case before they file any applications in Court. They cannot keep filing applications to Court within a short span of time.

95     The affidavits filed in respect of this current application dealt with issues which had already been dealt with previously in Summons 3188/2018 and Summons 119/2019. In the Defendant’s affidavits in Summons 3188/2018, she already raised the issue about the circumstances in which the agreement on the ancillary matters had been reached, how she claimed to have been misled and misrepresented to. She tried to set aside the agreed ancillary matters orders in the Interim Judgment (one of the terms related to the issue of children’s maintenance), and her application was dismissed.

96     Within a short span of time after Summons 3188/2018 was dismissed, the Defendant makes another attempt to remove one of the agreed clauses relating to the issue of maintenance of the children by alleging that there had been a change in circumstances to warrant a variation.

97     Not only will there be costs implications in continued litigation, parties need to be aware of the other non-monetary consequences. They will be spending a lot of time with their lawyers, giving instructions and perusing and approving draft documents prepared by their lawyers. Emotionally, they will be affected and will be tired dealing the acrimony. They will not be able to communicate with each other and it will be difficult for both to co-parent.

98     The acrimony will also affect the children. The children will be put in a difficult position between the parents. The children have to cope with the new arrangements where their parents are not staying together and they have a stepfather. On top of that, they will have to deal with the unhappiness and the acrimony between their parents. Due to the parents having to spend time dealing with the acrimony and the litigation, the time the children spend with the parties may also be affected in terms of the quality and the quantity.
