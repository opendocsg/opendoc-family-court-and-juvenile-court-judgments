Family Law – Maintenance of Child – Women’s Charter

29 April 2019

### District Judge Sheik Mustafa:

## Introduction

1       This is a case where the issue is whether a parent who, having provided an agreed amount of maintenance for his child, is bound to bear additional expenses incurred for the child without his reasonable knowledge or consent. I found that as he had been providing the agreed maintenance, and as the additional expenses were not only not known to him, but they were also not reasonable, he was not liable for them. The other parent has appealed against my decision and I provide my reasons here.

## Applicable Legal Principles

2       The law governing the maintenance of children is found in Part VIII of the Women’s Charter –

> **68**.    Except where an agreement or order of court otherwise provides, it shall be the duty of a parent to maintain or contribute to the maintenance of his or her children, whether they are in his or her custody or the custody of any other person, and whether they are legitimate or illegitimate, either by providing them with such accommodation, clothing, food and education as may be reasonable having regard to his or her means and station in life or by paying the cost thereto.

> **69.** (2)    The Court may, on due proof that a parent has neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for his child who is unable to maintain himself, order that parent to pay a monthly allowance or a lump sum for the maintenance of that child.

> (4)    The Court, when ordering maintenance for a child under this section, shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the following matters:

>> (a)    the financial needs of the child;

>> (b)    the income, earning capacity (if any), property and other financial resources of the child;

>> (c)    any physical or mental disability of the child;

>> (d)    the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage;

>> (e)    the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family;

>> (f)    the standard of living enjoyed —

>>> by the child before a parent neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the child;

>> (g)    in the case of a child, the manner in which he was being, and in which the parties to the marriage expected him to be, educated or trained; and

>> (h)    the conduct of each of the parties to the marriage, if the conduct is such that it would in the opinion of the court be inequitable to disregard it.

3       In the case of _TCT v TCU_[^1], the High Court ruled that due proof of neglect or refusal to provide reasonable maintenance for a child is required before the court would make an order against the parent in a section 69 application such as the present case.

> “The legal threshold is specified in section 69 simply because parties are not yet before the court. The section thus provides the specific criteria to found the Court’s jurisdiction. In a s 113(a) \[of the Women’s Charter\] application, there is no need to specify any criteria to allow a litigant to file the application, because the court is already seised of the suit. However, simply because a suit lies in its jurisdiction does not necessitate that the Court should go on and regulate the lives of parties with a lower threshold. The premise of need ought to still be there, in line with Parliament’s intentions in 1981, and the High Court’s previous interpretation in _Sengol_.”

4       Thus, proof of neglect, or of refusal to maintain, is a legal threshold that must be overcome by the complainant before to any other consideration.

## Background Facts

5       I found the following facts, which provide the background of the case.

6       The Complainant is a Vietnamese woman. She is visiting Singapore on a long-term visit pass.

7       The Respondent is an Italian man who, at the time of the commencement of these proceedings, was in Singapore on an employment pass.

8       Previously, in 2011, the Respondent, who was at that time resident in Italy, was on a business trip to Kuala Lumpur. There he met the Complainant. They had sexual relations. They remained in contact after that, even after the Respondent returned to Italy.

9       The Respondent visited Kuala Lumpur two more times and on both times he met up with the Complainant. On a night in September 2011, they had unprotected sex. After spending some more time with the Complainant, the Respondent decided that he would not have a relationship with her.

10     Soon thereafter, the Complainant informed the respondent that she was pregnant. After some Skype discussions, the Complainant agreed to abort the child. The Respondent sent her some funds for that purpose.

11     A few days later the Complainant contacted the Respondent and informed him that she had changed her mind. According to the Respondent’s testimony, the Complainant was emotional and threatened to jump off a building. Faced with this threat, the Respondent sent her sums of money several times.

12     Subsequently the Complainant informed the Respondent that she had given birth to the child in Vietnam in June 2012. She sent him an image of the birth certificate. According to the Respondent, he saw that the space for the name of the child’s Father was left blank.

13     The Complainant invited the Respondent to visit her and the child in a village near Hanoi, Vietnam. The Respondent went to Vietnam in September 2012. The Respondent gave the Complainant some money and returned to Italy.

14     The Complainant continued to ask the Respondent for money, and he sent to her, according to his testimony, a total of €5,404.50 between June and December 2012. He tendered to Court a breakdown of these transfers including the dates they took place.

15     A few months later, the Respondent’s employer seconded (presumably meaning expatriated) him to Kuala Lumpur. The Respondent invited the Complainant to visit him there with the child.

16     The visit was cut short after 2 days as the couple did not get along. The Complainant wanted to return to Vietnam with the child and requested for M$15,000 to renovate her house in Vietnam and to start her own business so that she would be able to support the child alone.

17     The Respondent agreed and offered to transfer the amount to the Complainant’s account. The latter disagreed and insisted on cash. The Respondent was only able to raise M$10,000 which he gave to her. The Respondent claims that the Complainant then said she would never ask him for money again.

18     However, after receiving the cash, the Complainant invited the Respondent to visit the child in Vietnam on its’ first birthday. The Respondent went to Vietnam in June 2013 bearing gifts for the Complainant and the child. By this time the Respondent had begun a relationship with someone else whom he intended to marry. The Complainant indicated she understood. It was the last time the Respondent saw the Complainant and the child.

19     A month after that however, the Complainant contacted the Respondent again, asking for funds to buy an apartment. The Respondent transferred some more funds to her in response.

20     In early 2014, the Complainant requested funds from the Respondent to purchase insurance in which the child would receive the entire pay out when he reaches 18 years old. The Respondent agreed to pay for this insurance in the amount of €1,200 a year.

21     In December 2014 and February 2015, the Complainant requested for funds to complete the construction of her house. The Respondent transferred €1,850 in total towards this purpose.

22     In May 2017, the Complainant moved to Singapore with the child. In August 2017, the Complainant received €1,200 from the Respondent as usual.

23     The Respondent got married. He was offered a position in Singapore and came here with his wife in June 2018. It is to be noted that at that time, he had been paying €1,200 a year to the Complainant towards the child’s insurance policy as agreed with the Complainant.

24     In July 2018, about a month into his arrival in Singapore, the Respondent was shopping in a supermarket at Scotts Square. To his shock, he met the Complainant there. He had thought that the latter was still in Vietnam. It was the first he had come to know that the Complainant and the child were in Singapore. The Complainant had not informed him that she and the child were going to relocate to Singapore.

25     As the Respondent had not informed his wife that he had a child, he requested that the Complainant not to inform her. The Complainant informed him that she had sold her house in Vietnam and was residing in Singapore with the child. She claimed that the child was in school in Singapore, and it was hard for them financially.

26     After that serendipitous meeting, the Respondent emailed to the Complainant to thank her for not informing his wife about their relationship. He received an email reply from the Complainant requesting for an additional S$2,500 a month from him, in addition to the €1,200 a year that he was already giving. The email stated that she knew a lawyer, who was helping her draft the email. She threatened to take him to Court if he did not accept her proposal. She also stated that she knew where he worked.

27     The Respondent counter-proposed to pay S$2,000 instead, to which the Complainant insisted on the $2,500 she had requested for earlier. She also suggested that the agreement could be written out and that it could address “privacy concerns”.

28     The Respondent accepted and asked for an itemised list of the child’s expenses. The Complainant sent one which added up to S$3,422. A draft agreement was sent to the Respondent. Several amendments were negotiated, but the Respondent was left discomforted by the insistence of the Complainant in drafting the agreement to enable her to increase the maintenance in future, including the cost of the child’s university education.

29     The Respondent discussed the matter with his wife. They decided that he should not agree to the proposal, and sought legal advice.

30     The Complainant’s “counsellor at law” sent an email to the Respondent’s employer informing them that he “was trying to reach the Respondent in respect to a litigation matter in the State Courts”. The Respondent took it as an attempt to embarrass him with respect to his employer.

31     The Respondent’s solicitors’ firm wrote to the Complainant and her “counsellor” to communicate with them directly. The Complainant’s “counsellor” responded that he passed by the Respondent’s solicitor’s residence and asked if her daughter still lived there.

32     The Complainant commenced this summons less than 2 weeks later, on 13 August 2018, alleging that the Respondent had failed to maintain the child since January 2013, a period of 5 years prior, and claiming a monthly sum of S$2,500 from him. By the time she filed her first affidavit on 9 November 2018, the sum claimed had increased to S$3,500.

33     The Respondent questioned the paternity of the child, and after some disagreements on who should bear the cost of the paternity test, the test was done and it was proven that the child was indeed the Respondent’s. The issue is no longer contested before me.

34     At the hearing, the Complainant presented her case in person and the Respondent was represented by counsel.

## Disputed Facts

35     Beyond the foregoing, the parties’ versions diverge substantially on other facts, which I shall examine in greater detail.

36     The Complainant’s case was that she had relocated with the child to Singapore as the educational standards here were better than in Vietnam. She did not dispute that she did not inform, or consult, the Respondent regarding the child’s relocation. She explained that she was in Singapore on a visit pass and was not allowed to work. The child was not enrolled in a local public school. She submitted a receipt of her payment of placing the child in an international school.

37     The Complainant testified that it was financially difficult for her, as she relied on her savings to survive in Singapore. She did not receive any assistance from her family. She did not reveal what her savings were, or how she was utilising them. She adduced receipts to show her expenditure on the child. She testified that she rented a shared apartment, producing a document purporting to be a receipt of her rent.

38     The Respondent’s case is that before the fateful encounter he had with the Complainant in Singapore, he had no knowledge that the Complainant had relocated to Singapore with the child. His case was that there was no reason for the Complainant to have done so. He contended that he ought only to be bound to the maintenance that he and the Complainant had agreed upon before he moved to Singapore. He claimed that he had sent a total amount of money to the complainant equivalent to S$42,986.40 since the time the child was born.

## Issues

39     Having found the facts above, I examined the issues of the case -

> a.     What was the manner in which the child was being, and in which the parties expected, the child to be educated or trained? Was it in Vietnam or Singapore?

> b.     Was it necessary or in the child’s best interest to relocate to Singapore?

> c.     Was it reasonable to require the respondent to bear the maintenance of the child in Singapore?

> d.     Did the parties have any agreement that the Respondent maintain the child at any other sum? Was this agreement reasonable?

> e.     Had the Respondent neglected or refused to pay it?

## Findings

40     The Complainant did not provide a reasonable reason why the child could not have continued to live and be educated in Vietnam, which was the country of his habitual residence. There was no evidence from the Complainant that the child would have been disadvantaged in any way if he had continued to stay in Vietnam. The Complainant testified that she found it financially difficult to support the child in Singapore. The question then was why did she embark on the adventure of relocating with her child to a country which was much more expensive to live in, while not being able to work, and to enrol him into an expensive international school in that country. I found that she did not provide a reasonable explanation to this. I found that she also did not provide any reasonable explanation of whether she had explored and eliminated other, more affordable options, such as a public school in Singapore, or an international school in Vietnam.

41     I found that the parties had come to an understanding on the manner in which the child was to be educated and raised, and that was for an ordinary education in Vietnam.

42     The Complainant did not inform the Respondent about her intention to relocate to Singapore with the child. Therefore, I found that the she had decided to relocate to Singapore without expecting the Respondent to contribute to the child’s maintenance here.

43     I found that the parties had come to an agreement or understanding that the Respondent was to pay to the Complainant an annual sum of €1,200 for the maintenance of the child. I also found that the sum was agreed based on the premise that the child was to live and be raised in Vietnam. Since the amount was agreed by the parties, I found it to be a reasonable sum as contribution by the Respondent towards the maintenance of the child in Vietnam.

44     I found that the Complainant did not disclose her means to contribute to the maintenance of the child. This was a relevant fact to the case, as both parents have a legal duty to contribute to the maintenance of the child. Her own evidence showed that she operated bank cards in Singapore. When asked why she did not disclose her bank account statements, her reply was that it was not necessary. I did not find this to be a satisfactory explanation given that she was able to produce voluminous other documents at the trial, and could have produced her bank statements quite easily. I drew the inference that if disclosed, the bank statements could have evidenced that she was not as financially hard put as she claimed to be.

45     Based on her testimony, the Complainant attempted to paint an impression that she had relocated to Singapore with little means of support. She testified that she survived only on her meagre savings, yet I found her expenditure was far from frugal. She did not produce primary evidence of her rent, adducing only a document purporting to evidence the rent she paid, but the document was purportedly an invoice for rent issued by a 10-year old boy. It further transpired that the document was in fact created by her “counsellor-at-law”. She had also stated in the application form for the international school that her address was at another location, at a house in Draycott Drive. A scrutiny of the numerous supermarket receipts she tendered do not evidence a frugal lifestyle of one who was in financial tightness and who had no legal source of income. Her claim for expenses even extended to diapers for the 6-year old child. Some of her receipts do not directly name her, but other persons. I found that her evidence on the expenses of the child were not reliable, and were intended to inflate her claim.

46     The Complainant’s summons declared that the Respondent had failed to maintain the child since January 2013, a period of 5 years prior, and claiming a monthly sum of S$2,500 from him. Yet according to her own testimony, the Complainant only came to Singapore in May 2017. Further, she knew that the Respondent had been paying her €1,200 as agreed maintenance since 2014. This greatly diminished the credibility of the Complainant’s testimony.

47     The Complainant’s case was that she had relocated to Singapore because she believed that the education here to be better than in Vietnam. Under cross-examination, it was evident that she had enrolled the child into an Indian international school here without even knowing what course she had enrolled him in to. The wisdom of relocating to Singapore only to enrol into an Indian international school is highly questionable, especially for one who claimed to have tight means and no source of income, given that the registration fee alone was S$2,945.71, and school fees were $4,201.89. I found that it was not probable that she relocated to Singapore for this purpose, nor would it be reasonable to place the burden of this expense on the Respondent.

48     The Complainant testified that she had approached the Singapore public schools to enrol the child but had been rejected. There was no evidence to corroborate her on this. Nevertheless, even if that is accepted, then the reasonable thing for her to have done was to return to Vietnam to enrol the child in something more affordable there, rather than to instead enrol him in a more expensive international school in Singapore.

49     Due to the above reasons, I found the Complainant’s version of why she relocated to Singapore not credible. A reasonable person would not have relocated to Singapore from Vietnam without adequate means to support herself and the child since she was not expecting any contribution from the Respondent more than the €1,200 he was already furnishing. I found that on a balance of probabilities, the Complainant must have either had sufficient funds herself to finance the relocation and education of the child in Singapore, or she had access to such funds to do so.

50     The Respondent claimed that he had given to the Complainant a total of equivalent to S$42,986.40 since the birth of the child. The Complainant admitted to receiving numerous payments from the Respondent, but did not confirm this total figure. I found that even if the precise amount was not absolutely proven, the actual amount was probably not very far off. However, I noted that not all the payments were meant to be maintenance of the child. At the least, it was not denied by the Complainant that the respondent had paid the €1,200 per year for the child, as agreed.

## Principles Applied and Judgment

51     Based on the foregoing findings, and applying the facts to the applicable principles of law, I found that –

> a.     The Complainant had not shown why it was necessary or in the child’s best interest to relocate to Singapore. The Complainant had the means to maintain the child in Singapore and she had the means to do so without the Respondent’s contribution. It was purely fortuitous that she met the Respondent. Requiring the Respondent to bear the maintenance of the child in Singapore is not reasonable in the circumstances. The Respondent cannot be made liable to contribute to the expenses of the child in Singapore.

> b.     The parties had had an agreement that the Respondent maintain the child at a yearly sum of €1,200, and this agreement was based on the understanding that the child was going to live a life and be raised in Vietnam. This is an agreement to maintain a child as envisaged by section 69 of the Women’s Charter.

> c.     That figure of €1,200, having been agreed to, was a reasonable maintenance of the child if he were raised in Vietnam. In this regard the Respondent has not neglected or refused to pay the agreed maintenance sum of €1,200.

> d.     In any event, an agreement to maintain a child under section 69 does not require the amount of maintenance to be reasonable having regard to the Respondent’s means and station in life nor by payment of the cost of the child’s accommodation, clothing, food and education. In other words, if parents come to an agreement on how they each should contribute to the maintenance of a child, the Court ought not review the reasonableness of the agreement. Such an agreement may, however, be overridden by a material change in circumstances. In view of what I have stated above, the Complainant’s unilateral decision to relocate to Singapore was not reasonable, and cannot be a material change of circumstances that would compel an unravelling of the agreement between the parties.

52     In view of the above, the Complainant had failed to prove on a balance of probabilities that the Respondent had neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the child. Therefore, I dismissed the Complainant’s summons. I made no order as to costs.
