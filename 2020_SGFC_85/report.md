Matrimonial law – Women’s Charter – Ancillary issues – Division of assets – Variation of order – Maintenance of former wife

19 October 2020

### District Judge Sheik Mustafa:

## Introduction

1       In this case the Defendant filed an application to vary certain portions of a consent order on ancillary matters consequent to his divorce from the Plaintiff. The Defendant requests for a variation of the order such as to give him the conduct of the sale of one of the matrimonial properties.

2       The Plaintiff counter-applies also to vary certain portions of the ancillary orders regarding disposition of assets, as well as for an order that the Defendant be liable to pay her a lump sum maintenance.

3       I heard the parties and made orders in favour of the Defendant’s application, and I dismissed the Plaintiff’s application. The Plaintiff appeals against my decision, and here are the grounds of my decision.

## The consent order

4       The parties divorced on \[XX\] October 2016. Subsequently, they consented to the terms of an order of court dated on ancillary matters on \[XX\] July 2018. It is useful to set out the full order is as follows –

> 1.     Division of the Matrimonial Properties

> a.    The property at \[M Street\] Singapore (‘the M Property’) shall be sold in the open market within 8 months from the date of the Certificate of Final Judgment and the net sale proceeds less outstanding loan and costs and expenses of sale shall be fully paid to the Plaintiff. Pending the sale of the same, the Defendant shall continue to solely bear the monthly mortgage instalments for the M Property. The Plaintiff shall have sole conduct of the sale and the Defendant shall do everything necessary to facilitate the sale including but not limited to promptly executing the sale documents and authorising the Plaintiff to receive payment of all sale proceeds and option monies. If the sale of the M property is delayed other than by reason of the Defendant’s default/neglect/omission to facilitate the sale, upon the sale of the M Property, the Plaintiff shall reimburse any payments made by the Defendant towards the M Property after the expiry of 8 months from the date of the Certificate of Final Judgment. Subject to the condition in the previous sentence, the Defendant shall consent to any application by the Plaintiff for an extension of time for sale of the M Property.

> b.    Pending the sale of the M Property above, the Defendant shall continue to pay the monthly mortgage loan instalments for the matrimonial home located at \[H Walk\] Singapore (‘the Matrimonial Home’). Within one month of the date of completion of the sale of the M Property, the Defendant shall transfer his rights title and interests in the Matrimonial Home to the Plaintiff without any cash consideration or refund of the Defendant’s CPF contributions (if any). The Plaintiff shall be solely responsible for the mortgage loan repayments after the date of the transfer. The Plaintiff shall reimburse the mortgage instalments payments made by the Defendant towards the Matrimonial Home after the sale of the M Property or after the expiry of 8 months from the date of the Certificate of Final Judgment, whichever is earlier;

> c.    The Plaintiff shall transfer all her rights title and interests in the property at \[Jalan S\], Kota Tinggi to the Defendant without any cash consideration concurrent with the transfer of the Matrimonial Home by the Defendant to the Plaintiff pursuant to Clause 3(b) above.

Upon the completion of the sale of the M Property, no maintenance is payable to the Plaintiff.

> b.    The interim maintenance orders dated \[XX\] November 2016 and \[XX\] August 2017 are discharged with immediate effect.

## The Defendant’s application.

5       The Defendant requests for the following:

> 1.    That Clause 1(a) of the Order of Court shall be varied to read as follows:

>> a.    The M Property shall be sold in the open market within 3 months from the date of the order to be made at a sale price not less than S$4,400,000/-, and the net sale proceeds (less (i) outstanding loan, (ii) costs and expenses of sale and (iii) the reimbursements to be made to the Defendant as stated hereinbelow) shall be fully paid to the Plaintiff.

>> b.    Pending the sale of the same, the Defendant shall continue to solely bear the monthly mortgage instalments for the M Property.

>> c.    The Defendant shall have sole conduct of the sale of the M Property.

>> d.    Prior to payment of the net sale proceeds to the Plaintiff, (i) all payments made by the Defendant towards the M Property after the date of \[XX\] March 2019 (being 8 months from Final Judgment), (ii) a further sum of S$70,000/- (being equivalent to the rental proceeds from the M Property paid into the Parties’ joint account no. \[22222\]) and (iii) another further sum of S$26,967/- (as per a letter dated \[XX\] May 2018 from M/s Gloria James-Civetta & Co) shall first be reimbursed to the Defendant out from the net sale proceeds and in priority to the said payment to be made to the Plaintiff.

>> e.    For the avoidance of doubt, the aforesaid phrase “all payments made by the Defendant” shall comprise payments made by the Defendant after the date of \[XX\] March 2019 (being 8 months from Final Judgment) towards the monthly mortgage loan instalments, the MCST fees and the property tax.

>> f.    The Registrar or Assistant Registrar of the Family Justice Courts under section 31 of the Family Justice Act is empowered to execute, sign or indorse all necessary documents relating to the sale of the M Property on behalf of the Plaintiff (including any option to purchase or sale and purchase agreement for the M Property provided the sale price is not less than S$4,400,000/-) should the Plaintiff fail to do so within seven (7) days of written request being made to the Plaintiff or her solicitors.

> 2.    Further and/or alternatively and in furtherance of carrying out Clause 1(a) of the AM order, it be ordered that the Defendant is entitled to be paid and for him to use all rental proceeds derived from the M Property since the date of the AM order (i.e. \[XX\] July 2018) towards defraying the monthly mortgage loan instalments over the M Property.

> 3.    The Plaintiff bears the cost and expenses of this application, which the Defendant may deduct in priority from the net sale proceeds of the M Property before paying the balance therefrom to the Plaintiff.

## The grounds for the Defendant’s application

6       The Defendant argues that under the consent order, the transfer of the matrimonial home is tied to the sale of the M Property. If the latter is not sold, the matrimonial home will not be transferred to the Plaintiff. Under the order as it stands now, the Plaintiff has the sole conduct of the sale of the M Property. This means that the Plaintiff is solely in the position to control or delay the execution of both the sale of the M Property as well as the transfer of the matrimonial home. Under the terms of the consent order, the Plaintiff was to sell the M Property within 8 months of the date of the final judgment of the case. However, more than 2 years have passed and the order has not yet been complied with by the Plaintiff. In the meantime, the Defendant has to bear the monthly mortgages for both the M Property as well as the matrimonial home. These amount to about $30,000 a month.

7       The Defendant also alleges that the Plaintiff had redirected the rent paid by the tenants of the M Property to herself, and that this results in depriving him of the funds needed to pay the mortgage for the property.

8       According to the Plaintiff, she has been trying her best to sell the M Property. This is challenged by the Defendant, who claims that an offer of $4,900,000 was made for the M Property, but it was rejected by the Plaintiff.

9       The Plaintiff also argues that it was the intention of the parties to sell the M Property at $6,000,000 so that there would be cash proceeds to achieve the purpose of securing a home for the Plaintiff in Singapore, to pay the Plaintiff’s debts and providing maintenance for the Plaintiff’s living expenses. The Plaintiff argues that only if the M property is sold at $6,000,000 would there net proceeds of more than $2,000,000. This is what is needed in order to meet her needs. The Defendant denies this last allegation.

## The issues

10     The relevant legislation is section 112 (4) of the Women’s Charter states as follows:

11     “The court may, at any time it thinks fit, extend, vary, revoke or discharge any order made under this section, and may vary any term or condition upon or subject to which any such order has been made.

12     The case of _AYM v AYL_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGCA 68</span>, the Court of Appeal provides the relevant guidance on variation of court orders. The questions to be asked are–

> i.     Are the relevant aspects of the order not yet implemented, that is, not yet spent?

> ii.     Have the relevant aspects of the order become unworkable? Can the substance of the order of the order be retained by a variation that will make the order workable?

> iii.     If indeed that leading up to the consent order the parties had planned to sell the property at $6,000,000 in order to provide maintenance to the Plaintiff, is this a relevant consideration?

## My findings

13     I find that there are aspects of the order regarding the sale of the MBS property by the Plaintiff that have not been implemented.

14     Leaving the order as it is, with the Plaintiff to have sole conduct of the sale, has not worked, and remains unworkable in view of the Plaintiff’s intention to sell it at a price that has proved unrealistic. In the meantime, the Defendant suffers continued prejudice because he has to bear the cost of the mortgage on the M property and pay maintenance to the Plaintiff, whilst the Plaintiff has no incentive to expedite the sale.

15     A period of more than 2 years has passed. This is more than an adequate period for the Plaintiff to have carried out her duties of sole conduct of the sale of the M property. The period contemplated by the parties at the time of the order was 8 months from the date of the Certificate of Final Judgment, i.e. 6 July 2018. The period ended in April 2019.

16     It is clear that if the Defendant is granted sole conduct of the sale in place of the Plaintiff, the substance of the order will be preserved and its objective attained. The M Property will be sold, its net proceeds given to the Plaintiff, the Defendant will be able to transfer the matrimonial home to the Plaintiff without consideration.

17     I do not accept that the parties had the plan to sell the MBS property only at a price that would yield an adequate amount of funds for the Plaintiff’s future maintenance. In any event, I would in any case be slow to infer the larger hopes of parties behind a consent order, and to give effect to them, when the terms of the order are manifestly clear and unequivocal on their own. I find that the text of the consent order does not reflect the alleged intention of the parties as alleged by the Plaintiff.

18     In order to facilitate the sale of the M Property, the Defendant has asked for the Court’s mandate to sell it at a lowered, more attainable, price. One similar property had been sold at the price of $4.68 million in November 2019. This was before the pandemic set in. I therefore find that $4.5 million is a reasonable price to sell the property at.

19     If the M property is sold, the Defendant ought to be able to deduct the payments he made after 8 months from the date of the Final Judgment, i.e. 5 March 2019. This is already stated in the consent order.

20     I further find that the Defendant is entitled to deduct from the net sale proceeds a sum of $35,000 being half of the rental proceeds from the M property. I find so because this was not provided for in the order, and the parties remain equal owners of the M property.

21     I find that the additional sum of S$26,967/- (as per a letter dated 24 May 2018 from M/s Gloria James-Civetta & Co), pre-dates the Court Order. Therefore, I make no order of it being reimbursed to the Defendant out of the net sale proceeds.

22     Due to the foregoing reasons, I grant the Defendant’s application with costs.

## The Plaintiff’s application

23     The Plaintiff’s application is as follows –

> That paragraph 1a, 1b, and 2a of the Order of Court FC/ORC 3313/2018 dated 2 July 2018 be varied as follows:

>> a.    The Defendant shall fully redeem the mortgage of the matrimonial home (‘the Matrimonial Home’) and shall thereafter transfer his rights title and interests in the Matrimonial Home to the Plaintiff without any cash consideration or refund of the Defendant’s CPF contributions (if any).

>> b.    The Defendant shall pay to the Plaintiff the sum of S$1,500,000 as lump sum maintenance.

>> c.    Upon the completion of the orders as set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) above, the Plaintiff shall transfer her rights title and interests in the property at M Property to the Defendant without any cash consideration or refund of the Defendant’s CPF contributions (if any).

## The grounds for the Plaintiff’s application

24     The Plaintiff argues that the consent order has become unworkable as it is not possible to sell the M Property at $6,000,000, and that to sell it at a lower price would go against the basis behind the consent order, which was to provide a lump sum to the Plaintiff to provide for her living expenses after paying off the mortgage on the matrimonial home with the proceeds of the sale. The plaintiff submits that if the M Property is sold at $5,150,000 she would be left with a surplus of barely $100,000.

25     So now the Plaintiff seeks to vary the arrangement such that the Defendant is to redeem the mortgage on the matrimonial home, and then transfer it to her without consideration or refund to the Defendant’s CPF, followed by the M Property being transferred to the Defendant.

26     The Plaintiff argues that because of the loss in value of the M Property, a material change of circumstances has occurred, and the Plaintiff’s request to vary the maintenance order ought to be granted.

27     The Plaintiff argues that due to the acrimonious relationship between the parties, a lump sum maintenance is justified, and it would not cripple the Defendant.

28     As for quantum, the Plaintiff submits that the lump sum ought to be in the based on the figure of $4,000 which was the amount of monthly maintenance agreed to in the consent order that the Defendant is to pay to the Plaintiff until the sale of the M Property. Ultimately, the Plaintiff seeks a sum of $1,500,000 as lump sum maintenance.

## My findings

29     The considerations to apply in this application are also derived from the case of AYM v AYL <span class="citation">\[2013\] 1 SLR 924</span>, as well as AEF v AEG <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 113</span> and TYA v TYB <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHCF 29</span>. The issues are whether the aspect of the consent order that is in question is unworkable, whether the substance of the order can be retained by a variation that will make the order workable, and, if the answers to the above are yes, whether the order ought to be varied to include a order of lump sum maintenance for the Plaintiff.

30     I find that the loss of value of the M Property does not render the consent order unworkable.

31     I reject the Plaintiff’s argument to bypass the sale of the M Property and to reverse the order of dealing with the two properties. It does not preserve the substance of the consent order, which is clearly to have the M Property sold, and then its sale proceeds be used to settle the mortgage on the matrimonial home. It would be a radical departure of the substance of the consent order.

32     I do not accept the Plaintiff’s argument that due to the loss of value of the M Property, she ought to be entitled instead to a lump sum maintenance of $1,500,000. This would be on top of her receiving her share of the sale of the M Property, whatever that is when it is sold, and in addition to her having the matrimonial home transferred to her free of mortgage.

33     I do not accept the Plaintiff’s claim that it was the intention of the parties that her 100% share of the proceeds of sale of the M Property were meant specifically to be her provision for the rest of her life. It is nowhere stated to be so in the consent order; it could easily have been expressly stated as such. That being so, there is thus no basis for the Plaintiff’s prayer for lump sum maintenance.

34     I do not accept the Plaintiff’s claim that both parties had intended for the Plaintiff to receive $2,000,000 from the sale of the M Property. The conversations the Plaintiff refers to indicate projections and expectations. They do not indicate an agreed intent between the parties that the Plaintiff is guaranteed to receive a certain sum.

35     In divorce cases, there is a distinction between maintenance and shares of matrimonial assets. When an order is made on division of matrimonial assets, naturally the parties will form expectations or projections on what the value of their respective shares will be from the sale of those assets. However, it does not mean that any party are entitled to exactly what they expected or projected. What they are entitled to, instead, is whatever is the value of their respective shares that result from the sale, based on the value of the asset at the time of its sale. If indeed it was the intention of the parties to secure a certain amount of value to be given to the Plaintiff from the sale, the order would have been phrased as such instead. In the present case, the value of the M Property drastically fell after the consent order; according to the Plaintiff, this was due to the government’s implementation of property cooling measures. This may have resulted in an unanticipated consequence for the Plaintiff, who was expecting to receive, the Plaintiff claims, a substantial windfall from the sale. Nevertheless, this expectation loss, by itself, does not render the order unworkable.

36     Therefore, I find that the Plaintiff is not entitled to rely on the loss of value of the M Property to be a change of circumstances that can justify the variation sought for.

37     In any event, I find that there is no reason for the Plaintiff to receive a lump sum maintenance from the Defendant. The consent order sets the Plaintiff to be provided for with a matrimonial home. The Plaintiff is receiving, and continues to receive, maintenance of $4,000 a month from the Defendant, even though the divorce took place in October 2016, albeit this is set to end upon the sale of the M Property. Taking into account all the circumstances of the case, including that the Plaintiff is to take over the mortgage of the matrimonial home with no need to refund the Defendant share, that the children’s maintenance are fully provided for, and that there has been sufficient time of 4 years since the divorce for the Plaintiff to adjust to her new unmarried status, I find that the Plaintiff is in no further need of maintenance from the Defendant once the M Property is sold and the matrimonial flat is transferred to her. This purpose is manifest from the consent order itself. It was the basis that the order was consented to by both parties, who were represented by lawyers at the time.

38     In view of the above, I dismiss the Plaintiff’s application with costs.
