Ancillary Matters – Division of assets, Care for and access to children, Maintenance for wife and children

4 November 2020

### District Judge Toh Wee San:

## Background Facts

1       The Plaintiff will be referred to as the “Wife” and the Defendant will be referred to as the “Husband”.

2       The parties were married in Singapore on 28 December 1999. There are three children to the marriage, two daughters and a son, aged 17, 15 and 13 respectively. The eldest daughter is studying at a polytechnic, the second daughter is in secondary three and the youngest son is in secondary one. All three children have been residing with the Wife ever since the Husband left the matrimonial home in 2018.

3       Both parties are currently 46 years old. The Wife has been a homemaker for almost the entire marriage but had the assistance of a domestic helper for most parts of the marriage. The Husband is self-employed.

4       The Wife commenced divorce proceedings on 2 November 2018. Interim Judgment was granted on an uncontested basis on Husband’s unreasonable behaviour on 26 December 2018. As such, the marriage lasted for 19 years.

5       The ancillary matters were contested and the issues to be determined included the following: -

> a.     Care and control and access to the children;

> b.     Division of matrimonial assets including the matrimonial home, a Housing Board Development flat;

> c.     Maintenance for the children; and

> d.     Maintenance for the wife.

6       The parties filed their ancillary matters (AM) affidavits and two rounds of Written Submissions. After hearing parties, I made the ancillary matters orders on 27 July 2020. The Wife have appealed against these orders and I now set out the reasons for my decision. A copy of my AM order is annexed.

## Children’s custody, care and control, and access

7       There was a consent order dated 1 April 2019 for the parties to have joint custody, with sole care and control of the children to the Wife and reasonable access to the Husband such as sending the children to school and subject to the children’s wishes.

8       The Husband had also filed Summons No. 362 of 2020 to vary the terms of the said consent order. In particular, the Husband sought a reversal of the care arrangements of the children. Alternatively, the Husband prayed that in the event that the Court was not minded to accord the children’s care and control to him, he sought a variation of the access arrangements.

9       As both the Summons No. 362 of 2020 and the ancillary matters were placed before me, I dealt with the issue of the children’s care and control and access as part of the ancillary matters and made no orders on the prayers in Summons No. 362 of 2020.

### The wife’s case for care and control and access

10     The Wife sought sole care and control of all three children on the basis that she has been a full-time caregiver for the children ever since she stopped work when she was pregnant with the eldest daughter.

11     The Wife argued that she was far more involved in the children’s daily lives as compared to the Husband who was busy at work. She argued that the Husband was absent from the children’s lives for a significant period from 2010 to 2015 and had only started to get closer to the children after he left the matrimonial home in 2018 (paragraphs 23 to 24 of of PWS1[^1]). However, since then, she has also been caring for the three children single-handedly and did not have any assistance from a domestic helper.

12     The Wife was prepared to accord the Husband with reasonable access to the children subject to their wishes, including sending the children to school.

13     The Wife claimed that the Husband visited prostitutes, engaged in lurid conversation with his friends and had a pornographic habit (paragraphs 25 to 27 of PWS1) and stated that their daughters told her that they felt uncomfortable with staying with the Husband. As such, the Wife was not prepared to allow the Husband to have overnight access with the children.

### The husband’s case for care and control and access

14     The Husband took the position that the three children were all afraid of the Wife and were not happy living with her. According to the Husband, all three children had expressed their desire to have overnight access with him and to go on overseas holidays with the Husband (paragraph 1.7.1 of DWS1[^2]).

15     The Husband submitted that he fetches the children to school every morning (paragraph 1.7.3 of DS1) and has been a good provider and participative father to the children. He denied having a pornographic habit or causing their daughters to feel uncomfortable (paragraph 8 of DWS3).

16     The Husband further submitted that after parties entered into the consent order, he found out that the Wife had not been providing proper care for the children. Furthermore, he did not want the children to live in fear of not pleasing the Wife and bear the brunt of her emotional outbursts and tantrums (paragraph 2 of DWS3). These reasons prompted him to file his application to ask for care of the children in his Summons No. 362 of 2020 (paragraph 1.7.2 of DWS1; paragraph 2 of DWS3).

17     The Husband was prepared to allow the Wife overnight access with the children if he were to be the parent with care and control of the children (paragraph 5.3 of DWS3).

### Court’s finding on care and control and access

18     At the hearing before me, both parties confirmed that they were agreeable for a joint custody order, but both asked to be the parent with care and control. Parties invited me to interview the children and a child interview was conducted for all three children.

19     Based on the evidence before me and taking into consideration what is in the children’s best interest, I ordered for there to be joint custody of the three children with sole care and control to the Wife and reasonable access to the Husband.

20     I encouraged parties to reach an agreement on the access arrangements as part of co-parenting. However, if both parties are not able to reach an agreement, then the Husband shall have access to the children every Saturday to Sunday (including overnight access). The Husband shall also have access to the children up to twice on weekdays. The children were comfortable with H and hence I did not restrict over-night access with H.

21     I also ordered for the access during school holidays (including overseas holidays) and public holidays to be equally shared between both parents.

## The matrimonial pool of assets

### The wife’s sole assets

#### Wife accepted husband’s position on Maybank fixed deposit account

22     In the Husband’s first Written Submissions dated 24 March 2020 (DWS1), he relied on the Maybank account statement that the Wife had furnished and submitted that the monies in the Wife’s Maybank fixed deposit account amounting to S$51,422.72 should be added into the matrimonial pool (paragraph 5.2 of DWS1). This was accepted by the Wife.

23     Accordingly, the assets in the Wife’s sole name are as follows: -

### The husband’s sole assets

#### Wife’s submissions on husband’s vehicles and bicycles

24     The Wife disputed the assets that were held in the Husband’s sole name.

25     In particular, the Wife wanted to include 5 cars and 6 bicycles. The husband was agreeable to include only three vehicles i.e. two cars and one bicycle. He argued that only these were presently in his possession.

26     In the Wife’s first Written Submissions dated 24 March 2020 (PWS1), she argued that the value of the following items should be included in the matrimonial pool. These were the vehicles that the Husband countered were no longer with him.

> a.     Vehicle Number SJKXXXXP – It was not disputed that this was scrapped in November 2018 for S$7,000. W argued that the scrap value of S$7,000 should be added back to the matrimonial pool (paragraph 56 of PWS1).

> b.     Vehicle Number SKGXXXXP – It was not disputed that this was transferred to the Husband’s business and used as a spare car. The Wife argued that the open market value of the said vehicle, amounting to S$27,271 ought to be added back to the matrimonial pool (paragraph 56 of PWS1).

> c.     Vehicle Number SLQXXXXB – It was not disputed that this was scrapped in February 2019 for S$8,000. W argued that the scrap value of S$8,000 should be added back to the matrimonial pool (paragraph 56 of PWS1).

> d.     Bicycles – The Wife argued that the Husband owed several expensive bicycles and the value of each of these expensive bicycles should be added into the matrimonial pool. The Wife identified at least 6 of such expensive bicycles and submitted for a value of S$5,000 to be ascribed to each bicycle (paragraph 61 of PWS1).

#### Husband’s submissions on husband’s vehicles and bicycles

27     The Husband’s submissions in his DWS1 to the above position was as follows: -

> a.     Vehicle Number SJKXXXXP – The monies from scrapping the said vehicle was used for running XXX (paragraph 5.3 of DWS1).

> b.     Vehicle Number SKGXXXXP – The vehicle was transferred to XXX in January 2020 as a spare vehicle for clients to rent free of charge when their respective cars were in the workshop.

> c.     Vehicle Number SLQXXXXB – The monies from scrapping the said vehicle was used for running XXX (paragraph 5.3 of DWS1).

> d.     Bicycle – The bicycles did not belong to him as he was merely helping his friends with repair and service. Furthermore, the bicycles that he had declared were of negligible value of S$200 to S$400 as they were purchased at judgment credit sales (paragraphs 5.3, 5.4 of DWS1).

#### Court’s finding on the husband’s vehicles and bicycles

28     Based on the evidence before me: -

> a.     I accepted that the three vehicles, namely the vehicles bearing the registration numbers SJKXXXXP, SKGXXXXP and SLQXXXXB were owned by XXX, a sole-proprietorship owned by the Husband. Two out of the three vehicles have been scrapped and the remaining one vehicle is being used by XXX. I note that the returns from such vehicles are in XXX’s bank account, which have been included as a matrimonial asset for division. As such, I rejected the Wife’s arguments to include the scrap value and the open market value of the said vehicles as part of the Husband’s sole assets.

> b.     I was not minded to add the value of the other bicycles to the matrimonial pool as argued by the Wife as there was a lack of evidence to show that there was tangible value to more than one bicycle worth S$ 5000.

29     Accordingly, the Husband’s assets that are held in his sole name are as follows: -

32     The total matrimonial pool of assets was valued at S$1,237,604.98.

## Division of matrimonial assets

33     Both parties disagreed on the approach to be applied in dividing the pool of matrimonial assets.

### Wife’s submissions on division of assets

34     The Wife submitted that I should apply the approach in **_TNL v TNK and another appeal and another matter_** _\[2017\] 1 SLR 60 (“_**_TNL v TNK_**_”)_ given that this was a long, single-income marriage.

35     The Wife argued that this was on the basis that the structured approach in **_ANJ v ANK_** _<span class="citation">\[2015\] SGCA 34</span>; <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span> (“_**_ANJ v ANK_**_”)_ was inappropriate as it unduly favoured the working spouse over the non-working spouse by recognizing financial contributions at both Step 1 and Step 2 of the _ANJ_ approach.

36     The Wife contended that there was no dispute that the Husband has always been the sole breadwinner of the family and the Wife did not work for a significant portion of the marriage.

37     The Wife had also referred me to case law in **_TZQ v TZR_** <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHCF 3</span> involving a long single-income marriage of 20 years where the High Court had applied the _TNL v TNK_ approach in determining the division of matrimonial assets.

38     Following the approach in _TNL v TNK_ where the Courts tend towards an equal division of the matrimonial assets, the Wife submitted that there should similarly be an equal division of the matrimonial pool of assets.

39     The Wife further submitted that there ought to be a 5% uplift given the unsatisfactory state of the Husband’s disclosure. Accordingly, the Wife submitted that she should receive 55% of the total matrimonial pool (paragraph 74 of PWS1).

### Husband’s submissions on division of assets

40     The Husband disagreed with the Wife’s submissions to apply the _TNL v TNK_ approach and contended that the correct approach was to apply the structured approach in _ANJ v ANK_. He submitted that this was a 17-year marriage and it would not fall within the ambit of a long-marriage (paragraphs 36 to 39 of DWS3[^3]).

41     The Husband went on to set out parties’ respective direct financial contributions based on the _ANJ_ approach, as follows:-

##### Husband’s position on direct financial contribution by parties towards matrimonial pool of assets (paragraph 8.2 of DWS1)

42     In view of the ratio of the direct financial contribution towards the XXX flat and after adding the value of parties’ respective assets held in their sole names, the Husband submitted that the Step 1 ratio for each party is as follows:-

<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="33.92%"> <col width="33.04%"> <col width="33.04%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Wife</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Husband</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Direct financial contributions</b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>(Step 1 ratio)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">28.1%</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">71.9%</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

43     With respect to the indirect contributions, the Husband disagreed with the Wife’s arguments that he did not care for or contribute towards the children. He contended that even though the Wife was a homemaker for most parts of the marriage, she was not a hands-on mother and had the assistance of a full-time domestic helper. The Husband had also referred to an affidavit that was affirmed by the parties’ domestic helper to illustrate not only the Wife’s behaviour towards the domestic helper but also the number of chores that the Wife delegated to the domestic helper on a daily basis (paragraphs 11.1 to 11.3 of DWS1).

44     The Husband further argued that he played a significant role in the domestic aspect of the marriage by going to the wet market and purchasing groceries together with the helper every weekend. The Husband also averred that he would spend time with the children after work and they would engage in physical activities without the Wife who did not want to join them.

45     In this regard, the Husband argued that the indirect contributions between parties ought to be 60:40 in favour of the Wife: -

##### Husband’s position on weightage between direct and indirect contributions

46     The Husband further argued that there should be greater weightage placed on parties’ direct contribution via-s-vis indirect contribution.

47     The Husband prepared three tables setting out the different average ratios to be ascribed to each party in situations where the weightage for direct contribution and indirect contribution was 50:50, 60:40, and 70:30 (paragraph 20.1 of DWS1): -

<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="33.92%"> <col width="33.04%"> <col width="33.04%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="2" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Situation / Weightage of direct financial contribution: indirect contribution</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Average ratio</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Wife</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Husband</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">50:50</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">44.05%</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">55.95%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">60:40</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">40.86%</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">59.14%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">70:30</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">37.67%</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">62.33%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Average</b></p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">40.86%</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">59.14%</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

48     Accordingly, the Husband submitted that the average ratio to ascribe to each party for the division of matrimonial assets would be 40.86% in favour of the Wife and 59.14% in favour of the Husband (paragraph 20.2 of DWS1).

##### Adverse inference

49     The Husband argued that I should not draw an adverse inference against him and had instead invited me to draw an adverse inference of 3% to 5% against the Wife.

50     This was premised on her failure to include the monies in her Maybank Fixed Deposit account amounting to S$51,422.72 as part of the matrimonial pool, and for the Wife’s failure to disclose the true amount standing in her POSB account which was S$106,504.16 when she withheld a cheque for a sum of S$18,392.03 from the said account (paragraph 18.3 of DWS1).

### Court’s finding on division of matrimonial assets

51     Applying the broad brush approach and taking into account that the Wife shall be the parent with care and control of the three children, I ordered for an equal division of assets between the both parties. In my view, this would be the equitable outcome one derives at, after applying the guidance drawn from the cases. The present case is not an extremely long marriage but the responsibility of being the care parent for three children is not light. Hence I have included the accommodation expenses of the children in the Wife’s share of the asset division while the monthly maintenance for the children below are for their education, medical, dental and living expenses.

52     As such, after deducting the assets that each party held in their sole names, each party will still be entitled to 50% of the net value of the joint assets. This will amount to approximately S$370,500 for each party. In conclusion, each party will have slightly more than S$ 600 000 in value of assets including their own.

53     I was not minded to draw an adverse inference against either party notwithstanding the invitation from both sides to do so.

## Children’s maintenance

54     Section 68 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (the “WC”) states that it is the duty of both parents to maintain the children. Section 69(4) of the WC also provides the factors for consideration when ordering maintenance.

### Wife’s case for children’s maintenance

55     The Wife submitted that the children’s monthly expenses were as follows (paragraphs 43 to 49 of PWS1): -

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="49.96%"> <col width="50.04%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Item</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Expenses per month</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Household expenses (4 pax)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">S$7,307.90</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Eldest daughter personal expenses</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">S$3,231</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Second daughter personal expenses</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">S$2,289</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Youngest son personal expenses</b></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">S$2,674</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

56     In view of the above, the Wife sought a total sum of S$10,300 per month as maintenance for all three children, being S$3,700 for the eldest daughter, S$3,500 for the second daughter and S$3,100 for the youngest son (paragraph 32 of PWS1).

57     The Wife also sought for the Husband to bear the full costs of the children’s tertiary education school fees, for the Husband to reimburse her the full costs of the children’s tuition and piano lessons, and for the Husband to link his debit card directly to the children’s Grab / Gojek accounts. The Wife also asked that the Husband continued to pay for the children’s handphone bills and insurance premiums (paragraphs 33 to 35 of PWS1).

58     The Wife argued that she was unemployed and the Husband was a savvy businessman who earned S$2,997.50 from his sole-proprietorship, XXX, and drew a further income of S$3,000 from his employment at XXX (paragraph 36 of PWS1).

59     The Wife casted her doubts on the Husband’s S$6,000 salary as she argued that he had given her around S$12,000 per month to pay for the family’s and her own expenses (paragraph 37 of PWS1).

60     The Wife submitted that she was prepared to return to the workforce but would likely only be able to secure a job that pays S$2,000 per month to which will go towards her personal expenses (paragraph 50 of PWS1).

61     Effectively, the Wife’s submissions were that the Husband ought to bear 100% of the children’s expenses.

### Husband’s case for children’s maintenance

62     The Husband disagreed with the Wife’s calculations of the children’s monthly expenses and took the view that the figures have been inflated. Amongst others, the Husband argued that the tuition fees have been exaggerated as the children, especially the youngest son, did not require that many tuition classes.

63     Based on the Husband’s own calculations, the children’s expenses were as follows (paragraph 9.2.3 of DWS2): -

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="50.22%"> <col width="49.78%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Item</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Expenses per month</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Household expenses (4 pax)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">S$2,158</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Eldest daughter personal expenses</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">S$785.96</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Second daughter personal expenses</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">S$689.99</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Youngest son personal expenses</b></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">S$668.57</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

64     The Husband stated that out of the above amount, he was already paying for some of the expenses directly to the vendors (paragraph 9.3 of DWS2).

65     In any event, the Husband calculated that the total amount that the children needed amounted to S$2,144.52 per month (paragraph 37 of DWS2; paragraphs 28 to 29.2 of DWS3).

66     The Husband stated that he earned a monthly gross salary of about S$5,997.50 as a sole-proprietor of XXX and a supervisor of XXX (paragraph 3 of DWS2) and relied on the Plaintiff’s last drawn salary of S$2,000 (paragraph 38 of DWS2).

67     Accordingly, the Husband submitted that parties ought to bear the children’s expenses in the ratio of 77% by him and 23% by the Wife (paragraph 38 of DWS2).

### Court’s finding on the children’s reasonable expenses

68     I opined that the Wife’s computation of the children’s expenses were on the high side. I assessed the reasonable quantum to be as follows instead.

### Considerations in determining maintenance for the children

70     I considered the financial ability and earning capacity of the parties.

71     The Wife was a homemaker. The Husband was self-employed. Based on the documents furnished by the Husband, his average income was about S$6,000 per month. However this was disputed by the Wife as she contended that the Husband had given her about S$10,000 or more per month during the recent years of the marriage.

72     I further noted that there was a consent order between parties dated 1 April 2019 for the Husband to pay a sum of S$6,000 per month to the Wife and the three children. The consent order also stated that the Husband shall pay additional payment towards the children and the household expenses. The total agreed amount payable by the Husband to the Wife added to about S$8,000 or more per month. The Husband asserted that he agreed to this arrangement in the absence of legal advice and required financial aid from his father to pay such sum to the Wife. However, this was disputed by the Wife. I also noticed that there was a “without prejudice” clause in the consent order to the parties’ right to raise issues on the quantum and commencement date of the maintenance.

73     In my view, the Husband had some confidence in his ability to pay the said sum of maintenance, be it on his own earnings, with his family’s help or both. However the “without prejudice” clause and the fact that he was in person reflected some discomfort or reluctance on his part too. I opined that it was possible that the Husband earned or could earn more than S$ 6000 per month but his assets in his sole name did not suggest that he had exceptional wealth or earning capacity. Having considered all the circumstances including the earning capacity of both parties, I decided that the appropriate ratio to which parties shall bear the children’s expenses is 80% by the Husband and 20% by the Wife.

74     However, I also considered the fact that the Wife is currently unemployed as she has been a homemaker for a large portion of the marriage. As such, I recognised that she may need some time before she can secure gainful employment.

75     In view of the above considerations, I ordered for the Husband to pay the full amount of S$3,800 per month as maintenance for the children for a period of 12 months. From the 13th month onwards, the Husband shall contribute S$3,000 per month and the Wife shall contribute the remaining S$800 per month towards the children’s monthly expenses.

76     In addition, I also ordered for the Husband to pay 80% of the expenses incurred by the children’s tertiary education in Singapore and their medical and dental expenses. The Wife shall be responsible for the remaining 20% of the said expenses. The children are likely to turn to the Husband for further financial support if the need arises, for example to purchase more expensive items for learning purposes such as electronic devices or take on more tuition classes for National examinations. I hope that the Husband will be supportive as he has a stronger financial capability compared to the Wife.

## Wife’s maintenance

### Wife’s submissions on maintenance for the wife

77     The Wife asked for the Husband to provide lump sum maintenance of S$312,000, calculated at S$5,200 per month for a period of 5 years (paragraph 75 of PWS1). This is derived from the sum of the Wife’s monthly personal expenses of S$3,390 and her ¼ share of the estimated household expenses of S$1,826.98 (paragraph 77 of PWS1).

78     The Wife explained that prior to the breakdown of the marriage, the Husband had been providing her a sum of S$5,000 per month for her personal expenses, which was given on top of the reimbursements that she had received from him for the household expenses.

79     The Wife is agreeable to rejoin the workforce and secure her own income but stated that she will need a period of 5 years to do so. She further argued that she will only be able to secure a job with a salary of no more than S$2,000 (paragraph 79 of PWS1).

### Husband’s submissions on maintenance for the wife

80     The Husband took the position that the Wife had inflated her expenses and argued that the Wife did not need an allowance of S$5,000 every month during the marriage as she had been double counting her expenses.

81     It was argued that the Wife had extorted monies from the Husband who had to borrow monies from his father in order to appease her (paragraphs 24 to 25 of DWS3). Based on the Husband’s calculations, he submitted that the Wife’s reasonable expenses was S$1,680.21 per month (paragraph 37 of DWS2).

82     To that end, the Husband submitted that the maintenance payment pursuant to the consent order dated 1 April 2019 that provided S$6,000 per month for maintenance of Wife and children had in fact enriched the Wife and enabled her to accumulate wealth (paragraph 30 of DWS2).

83     The Husband also agreed with the Wife that she ought to return to the workforce to seek employment especially when the children are at the age of reasonable independence and would not require the Wife to play the part of homemaker (paragraph 36 of DWS3).

### Court’s finding on maintenance for the wife

84     I opine that the Wife’s expenses were on the high sides and a more reasonable estimate is below.

85     I had considered the factors in the determination of maintenance. In view of the fair and equitable share of the asset division that the Wife would obtain, I ordered the Husband to pay a monthly maintenance of S$1,500 to the Wife for a period of 6 months, and a monthly maintenance of S$750 from the 7th to the 12th month. Thereafter, the Wife shall not be entitled to any more maintenance from the Husband. The initial S$ 3000 and then S$ 5000 per month of maintenance monies that the Husband gave her before the divorce was a generous sum. I believe these enabled the Wife to accumulate her own savings. The Wife would be permitted to keep such savings in her own name after the divorce. The above were meant to enable the Wife to transit to a post-divorce life after a year and parties shall have a clean break thereafter, which in my view was reasonable.

## Costs

86     Since neither side had gotten what they applied for, I was not minded to award costs to either party and made no order as to costs.

87     In conclusion, this was a very unfortunate case. Parties had spent many years together raising their three children. Like many broken families, I am sure both sides went through much grief and heartache to end this marriage. I hope that they will put the unhappy past behind and co-parent together effectively.
