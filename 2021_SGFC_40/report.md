Family law – Ancillary powers of court – Access – Maintenance – Matrimonial assets

19 April 2021

### District Judge Michelle Elias Solomon:

## Introduction

1       The Plaintiff Wife (“the Wife”) and the Defendant Husband (“the Husband”) were married on 8 May 1997. The Wife commenced divorce proceedings on 30 May 2016 and the interim judgment of divorce (“interim judgment”) was granted on 11 April 2017.

2       The Wife is 54 years old while the Husband is 58 years of age. The Husband is a translator and the Wife is currently unemployed[^1]. The Husband and Wife (“the Parties”) have one child, \[E\], who was born on \[birth date redacted\] 2005 (“the Child”). The Child is now 15 years old.

3       On 21 December 2020, I delivered my decision on the ancillary matters relating to access, maintenance for the Child, maintenance for the Wife and the division of matrimonial assets[^2]. The Wife appealed against the whole of my decision and I now provide the grounds.

## Facts and previous proceedings

4       Following the grant of the interim judgment, the Husband did not participate in the ancillary proceedings and a final order in respect of the ancillary matters was granted, in the Husband’s absence, on 14 March 2018 (“the first Ancillary Order”). About two months after the first Ancillary Order was made, the Husband applied to set it aside[^3]. I heard this application and granted the orders sought. The Wife, being dissatisfied with my decision, appealed[^4]. The appeal was dismissed[^5]. With the dismissal of the appeal, the ancillary matters continued[^6], culminating in the final ancillary matters hearing before me.

## The evidence and orders

5       A total of eleven affidavits were filed by the Parties in the ancillary proceedings:

> (a)     Wife’s Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 19 July 2017 (“**W1**”)

> (b)     Wife’s Affidavit exhibiting CPF Board’s response filed on 15 September 2017 (“**W2**”);

> (c)     Wife’s Supplemental affidavit filed on 2 February 2018 (“**W3**”);

> (d)     Wife’s 2nd Round Ancillary Matters affidavit filed on 15 January 2020 (“**W4**”);

> (e)     Wife’s 3rd Round Ancillary Matters affidavit filed on 19 June 2020 (“**W5**”);

> (f)     Wife’s final affidavit following the directions at the hearing of the ancillary matters filed on 27 August 2020 (“**W6**”);

> (g)     Husband’s Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 16 September 2019 (“**H1**”);

> (h)     Husband’s 2nd Round Ancillary Matters affidavit filed on 15 January 2020 (“**H2**”);

> (i)     Husband’s affidavit exhibiting documents filed on 4 March 2020 (“**H3**”);

> (j)     Husband’s 3rd Round Ancillary Matters affidavit filed on 17 June 2020 (“**H4**”);

> (k)     Husband’s final affidavit following the directions at the hearing of the ancillary matters filed on 27 August 2020 (“**H5**”); and

> (l)     The Child’s affidavit filed on 19 June 2020.

6       The hearing of the ancillary matters[^7] concluded with directions for an affidavit to be filed by each party with specific information and documents[^8]. After the filing of these affidavits, I made the following final orders in respect of the ancillary matters:

> (a)     By consent, the Parties shall have joint custody of the Child, with care and control to the Wife.

> (b)     The Husband shall have access to the Child every Sunday from 9:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.

> (c)     The parties shall be at liberty to:

>> (i)       vary the care arrangements under this order by mutual agreement; and

>> (ii)       agree to any other additional or make-up access as they see fit, having regard to the Child’s schedule.

> (d)     The Parties and the Child shall attend counselling at the Divorce Support Specialist Agency.

> (e)     The Husband shall pay the monthly sum of $1,500 to the Wife as maintenance for the Child with effect from 15 January 2021 and thereafter on the 15th day of each subsequent month.

> (f)     There shall be no maintenance for the Wife.

> (g)     All maintenance payments shall be deposited directly into the Wife’s POSB Savings Account ending with 654-0.

> (h)     In respect of the matrimonial home:

>> (i)       Within 3 months of the Final Judgment, the matrimonial flat/property at \[address redacted\], shall be transferred (other than by way of sale) to the Husband upon the Husband making the full required CPF refunds to the Wife’s CPF account. The Husband shall:

>>> (A)       bear the costs of the transfer;

>>> (B)       take over the outstanding mortgage; and

>>> (C)       pay the Plaintiff a cash portion equivalent to the difference between $223,684 and her full CPF refunds.

>> (ii)       If, for whatever reason, Husband unable or unwilling to take over ownership of the flat, then within 6 months of the Final Judgment, the matrimonial home at \[address redacted\] shall be sold in the open market. The sale proceeds shall be apportioned as follows:

>>> (A)       To make full payment of the outstanding housing loan;

>>> (B)       To pay the HDB resale levy (if any);

>>> (C)       To pay the requisite CPF refunds in accordance with applicable CPF laws to all owners’ respective CPF accounts;

>>> (D)       To pay all costs and expenses incidental and relating to the sale of the property; and

>>> (E)       The balance sale proceeds shall be divided in the following manner: 100% to the Wife. In addition, the Husband shall pay the Wife a cash portion equivalent to the difference between $223,684 and her full CPF refunds and 100% of the balance sale proceeds.

> (i)     The Registrar or Assistant Registrar of the Family Justice Courts under section 31 of the Family Justice Act 2014 is empowered to execute, sign, or indorse all necessary documents relating to matters contained in this order on behalf of either party should either party fail to do so within seven days of written request being made to the party.

> (j)     Each party to retain all other assets in their respective names.

> (k)     Liberty to apply.

## Issues to be determined

7       The Parties agreed to have joint custody of the Child, with care and control to the Wife[^9]. The issues for determination therefore were:

> (a)     The Husband’s access to the Child;

> (b)     Maintenance for the Child;

> (c)     Maintenance for the Wife; and

> (d)     The division of matrimonial assets.

8       I will deal with each issue in turn.

## Issue 1: Access

9       Following a mediation session in or about January 2017, the Parties signed a draft consent order recording agreed interim terms on maintenance, custody, care and control and access. This draft consent order was signed by both Parties but never formally recorded as an Order of Court. Nevertheless, its terms have governed the Husband’s access to the Child since January 2017. The access terms were as follows:

> (a)     The Husband shall have access to the child of the marriage on Sundays, with effect from 22 January 2017, from 9.00am to 8.00pm and during such access, the Husband is to ensure that the child of the marriage attends her weekly Aikido classes from 11.00am to 1.00pm and her Thinking Class from 4.30pm to 7.30pm.

> (b)     In relation to the Husband’s Sunday access, the Husband shall pick the child of the marriage up from the Wife at Orchard MRT Station at 9.00am and return the child of the marriage to the Wife at Newton MRT Station at 8.00pm the same day.

10     At the hearing of the ancillary matters, the Parties’ positions on access were as follows -

> (a)     Wife: the existing access terms should be made final, subject to the Child’s schedule and wishes[^10]; and

> (b)     Husband: current Sunday access to continue, and enlarged access terms were sought as follows –

>> (i)       Dinnertime on a weekday from 6.00pm to 8.00 pm;

>> (ii)       Additional one weekday per week from 9.00am to 8.00pm during each June and December school holidays;

>> (iii)       Alternate public holidays from 9.30am to 4.30pm; and

>> (iv)       Further access to be subject to review[^11].

11     Prior to the ancillary matters hearing, the Child expressed her wish, through the Wife’s solicitors, to be heard in respect of the child-related issues[^12]. In view of the Child’s age, I allowed the Child to file an affidavit stating her preferred access times[^13]. After reviewing the Child’s affidavit, I was of the view that it would be helpful, in making final orders on access, to have a brief interview with the Child. At our meeting[^14], I found her to be a delightful, confident and articulate teenager.

12     After considering the evidence and submissions as a whole, and having regard to the Child’s age and wishes expressed in her affidavit, I was of the view that the access order ought to continue, with an additional clause allowing the Parties to agree on additional access having regard to the Child’s schedule. In making this order, I considered the following factors:

> (a)     There were no problems _per se_ with the current access arrangement; the Husband simply sought expanded access with the Child on specific days and times. The main difficulty I had with making such orders was because of the Child’s age. I took the view that she was old enough to communicate with her father on any additional access[^15], and provided for this in my orders.

> (b)     With the Child’s busy school and after-school schedule, the intention was to promote parent-child communication in arranging meaningful contact time. I was of the view that this could not be achieved by ordering a list of stipulated access days and times as proposed by the Husband, _in addition_ to what was currently in place, particularly when the Child herself wanted access hours to be _reduced[^16]_.

> (c)     I did not consider it necessary to stipulate a drop off and pick up location for the Child, as she was older now and may prefer to have different (or flexible) pickup/drop-off arrangements; and

> (d)     I was mindful of the Wife’s position that the interim access order should be made final.

13     For these reasons, I granted the access orders in the terms above. I was also of the view that the Parties and the Child would benefit from counselling and made the necessary orders in this regard.

## Issue 2: Maintenance for the Child

14     The Wife sought the cash sum of $3,500 per month as maintenance for the Child. She also sought an order that parties bear the Child’s tertiary education fees equally until she completes her tertiary education at a university of her choice[^17]. I did not consider it appropriate to make orders on the Child’s tertiary education as part of the ancillary orders; there was no evidence on her choice of school, how much this would cost or even if the Parties had disagreed on this issue. The Parties will therefore need to consider tertiary education at the appropriate juncture.

15     Pursuant to the agreed interim terms on maintenance, the Husband had been paying the monthly sum of $1,500 as the Child’s maintenance since 15 January 2017[^18]. However, the Husband’s final position on maintenance was that he should only be made to bear half of the Child’s expenses, which he estimated to be about $1,847[^19]. He therefore sought an order that he pay $900 per month for the Child’s maintenance, or half of the monthly expenses which I deemed reasonable.

16     In arriving at what I considered a reasonable sum of maintenance to be paid by the Husband, I first had to determine the reasonableness of the Child’s expenses. The table below sets out the Child’s expenses and my assessment of a reasonable amount for each item of expense:

17     Based on the table above, I found the Child’s reasonable monthly expenses to be about $2,380. However, this sum _excluded_ housing and utility costs, which were present the Wife’s list of expenses[^20], but not the Child’s. As there was a cost associated with housing the Child, I was of the view that the sum of $1,500 currently paid by the Husband covered approximately half of the Child’s expenses. I was also of the view that parties should bear the Child’s expenses equally, as their income and earning capacities were about the same[^21].

18     $1,500 was also the sum agreed to by parties almost four years ago, albeit in the interim. Overall, I considered it a fair and reasonable amount having regard to all the circumstances of this case, including the Parties’ expenses, the Child’s expenses and Parties’ income. For these reasons, I did not disturb the Husband’s monthly contribution to the Child’s expenses and made a final maintenance order of $1,500 per month as maintenance for the Child.

### The Parties’ income

19     I now turn to the Parties’ income. Prior to being retrenched in February 2018, the Wife earned an income of $15,000 a month[^22]. According to her, she did not earn any income in 2019[^23]. As such, I considered it appropriate to review the parties’ income over the last 3 years in order to best assess the Parties’ income and earning capacities[^24]:

20     Based on the table above, I found that the Parties’ average income and earning capacities were about the same. I was therefore of the view that they should share the Child’s reasonable expenses equally.

## Issue 3: Maintenance for the Wife

21     I now turn to maintenance for the Wife. The Wife sought lump sum maintenance of $105,000[^31]. The Husband’s position was that there should be no maintenance (either lumpsum or periodic) payable to the Wife[^32]. After considering the evidence and submissions, I declined to make an order in respect of maintenance for the Wife for the following reasons:

> (a)     The Wife possessed a good earning capacity, with her last job paying her $15,000 a month;

> (b)     While the Wife faced some health issues, she had not demonstrated that these issues affected her ability to work and/or earn a good income. In fact, _after_ the onset of her health issues in June 2017[^33], she still managed to earn well.

> (c)     I took into consideration the Wife’s maintenance claim in making orders on the division of the matrimonial property.

22     For these reasons, I was unable to find a basis to award the Wife maintenance, either periodic or lump sum.

## Issue 4: The division of matrimonial assets

23     The Parties jointly owned an HDB flat and agreed as follows:

> (a)     The only asset to be divided was the matrimonial home at \[address redacted\] (‘the flat’); and

> (b)     all other assets belonging to them, held in their respective sole names, were to be excluded from the asset pool for the purposes of a just and equitable division[^34].

24     The net value of the flat was agreed at $406,698.40[^35]. The Parties’ final positions on the division of the flat were as follows -

> (a)     Wife: she was entitled to 95% of the flat[^36].

> (b)     Husband: he was entitled to 53.4% of the flat[^37].

25     Parties disagreed over their direct financial contributions (‘DFC’) to the flat, and this table sets out their respective positions:

26     The Parties’ disagreement over their respective DFCs arose because the Wife sought to include certain items as part of her DFC[^39]. The table below sets out the Parties’ positions, and my findings:

27     Based on my findings above, I calculated the Parties’ DFC as follows:

28     In terms of _indirect_ contributions, the Parties’ positions were as follows:

> (a)     Wife[^52]: 10% (Husband) : 90% (Wife)

> (b)     Husband[^53]: 40% (Husband) : 60% (Wife).

29     This was a 20-year marriage during which both parties worked. According to the Husband, he experienced a career switch between 2007 to 2009, during which his income took a dip[^54]. According to the Wife, the Husband was ‘in and out’ of jobs between 2002 and 2012 and refused to seek gainful employment, leaving the Wife to bear the financial burden of the family[^55].

30     The Parties also took different views of their indirect contributions. According to the Husband, he paid for the family’s expenses[^56] and was an invested father to the Child[^57]. According to the Wife, the Husband was a selfish father[^58] who would only perform his duties as a father when nudged to do so by her[^59], and his contentions on his efforts towards the Child were mere ‘half truths’.

31     In making a decision on what was a just and equitable division of assets, I was not expected to undertake a forensic exercise at the hearing of the ancillary matters. This is because, as stated by the Court in the case of _ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span>:

>     Contributions in the form of parenting, homemaking and Husbandry, by their very nature, are incapable of being reduced into monetary terms. No mathematical formula or analytical tool is capable of capturing or accommodating the diverse and myriad set of factual scenarios that may present themselves to court as to how the parties may have chosen to divide among themselves duties and responsibilities in the domestic sphere. It is in making this determination that what is known as the broad brush approach would have to come into play. What values to give to the indirect contributions of the parties is necessarily a matter of impression and judgment of the court. \[Para 24\]

32     Therefore, in adopting a broad-brush approach and having regard to all the circumstances of this case, I was of the view that the Parties’ indirect contributions[^60] should be at a ratio of 70% (Wife) : 30% (Husband). I considered this ratio appropriate in view of the following -

> (a)     The length of the marriage;

> (b)     On the evidence, I was satisfied that the Wife was the primary caregiver to the Child. Due credit should be given to her indirect contributions in the domestic sphere;

> (c)     The needs of the minor child. The Parties agreed that the Wife shall have care and control of the Child. The Wife is therefore responsible for roofing and housing the Child; and

> (d)     The Wife’s claim for maintenance for herself.

33     The Parties agreed that equal weightage should apply for direct and indirect contributions[^61]. The aggregate ratio was therefore 55% (Wife) : 45%. (Husband), calculated as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="50.88%"> <col width="29.82%"> <col width="19.3%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="b" colspan="3" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Court’s Calculation</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="2" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Direct Financial Contributions</b></p><p align="right" class="Table-Para-1">Ratio</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">W</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">H</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">40.6%</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">59.4%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Indirect Contributions</b></p><p align="right" class="Table-Para-1">Ratio</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">70%</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">30%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Aggregate Ratio</b></p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>55%</b> <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>45%</b> <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

34     Based on the Parties’ direct and indirect contributions, and that I had made no order on the Wife’s maintenance, I was of the view that the order on division was fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this case.

35     Since the net value of the matrimonial home was agreed at $406,698.40:

> (a)     The Wife’s 55% share amounted to $223,684[^64].

> (b)     The Husband’s 45% share amounted to $183,014[^65].

36     As the Husband was living in the flat, I considered it appropriate to give him the option of retaining the flat if he wished. Should he choose to do so, he is obliged to make up the difference between the Wife’s CPF contributions[^66] and the value of her award under my order[^67] by way of a cash payment to her. Accordingly, in the event of a sale of the property, the Wife will be entitled to 100% of the balance sale proceeds[^68] in order to achieve her entitlement of $223,684 under my order. Any shortfall will have to be made up in cash by the Husband.

37     Finally, I was invited by the Wife to draw an adverse inference against the Husband for his failure to make full and frank disclosure of his assets. However, I was of the view that the evidence did not support any reason to draw an adverse inference; the Husband had explained on affidavit[^69] that he could not recall some transactions. The Husband also complied with directions to produce closing statements for certain accounts[^70] and filed an affidavit exhibiting these documents[^71]. I was therefore unable to agree with the Wife’s submissions that the Husband’s failure to recall details of certain transactions was tantamount to a failure to make full and frank disclosure.

38     Based on the evidence and submissions as a whole, and the disclosure already provided by the Husband, I remained unpersuaded that there was an adverse inference to be drawn, or that this inference warranted a 20% ‘uplift’ in the Wife’s favour[^72].

## Conclusion

39     I took the view that overall, the orders on division of assets and maintenance were fair and reasonable, having regard to all the circumstances of the case. Parties were unable to agree on the issue of costs. After considering the Parties’ respective written submissions on costs and the final orders made in respect of the ancillary matters, I was of the view that there should be no order as to costs.
