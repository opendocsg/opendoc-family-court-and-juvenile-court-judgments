Family Law – Material change in circumstances – Variation of consent order

22 June 2020

### District Judge Christina Koh:

1       Summons 650016/2019 (“the Summons”) was an application by the Respondent Husband (“the Husband”) to vary a consent order which _inter alia_ provided for spousal maintenance to be paid to the Petitioner, his second wife (“the Wife”) upon their divorce. The Order of Court dated 6 April 2001 (“the Consent Order”), which settled all the ancillary matters of their divorce, provided at Clause 2 that the Husband is to pay to the Wife maintenance of $5,000 per month and $2,000 for their son[^1].

2       The parties were married on 12 December 1985. Their son J was born on X 1988. Child maintenance had long ceased as of 2009. J lives with the Wife. The parties were divorced pursuant to a Decree Nisi granted on 5 January 2001. Under the Consent Order, the Wife received an equal share in the proceeds of sale of the matrimonial home. It is undisputed that the Husband had paid monthly maintenance to the Wife from April 2001 to August 2019. This works out to $5,000 paid to her consecutively over 221 months amounting to a sum of $1,105,000 in spousal maintenance. It is also undisputed that the Husband had never tried to vary the Consent Order prior to the Summons.

3       The Husband filed the Summons on 23 July 2019 asking for an order to vary Clause 2 of the said Consent Order so as to rescind the maintenance for the Wife, and also for costs to be paid by the Wife.

4       The Summons was heard by me on 12 March 2020. Having read the affidavits of the parties and their written submissions, and after hearing counsel’s oral arguments, I granted the application of the Husband. I ordered a variation of the Consent Order in that the $5,000 monthly maintenance is rescinded with effect from 1 September 2019. I further ordered that $300 costs is to be paid by the Wife to the Husband.

5       The Wife has filed an appeal against the whole of my decision and I now provide my detailed grounds.

#### Judicial Basis to Vary Consent Orders providing for Spousal Maintenance

6       The power of the court to vary an agreement for maintenance is found in section 119 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the WC”) which reads:

> _Subject to section 116, the court may at any time and from time to time vary the terms of any agreement as to maintenance made between husband and wife, whether made before or after 1st June 1981, where it is satisfied that there has been any material change in the circumstances and notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any such agreement._

7       The Court of Appeal in **_AYM v AYL and another appeal_** <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 559</span> at \[14\] clarified that the circumstances referred to in “material circumstances” in section 119 of the WC are those prevailing at the time the agreement for maintenance was entered into; and that the party seeking to vary an agreement for maintenance must show that the said material changes related to those circumstances.

#### The Husband’s Reasons for Seeking a Variation of the Consent Order

8       The Husband’s ground for the variation of the Consent Order was that there is a material change in circumstances since it was granted. He relied on the following to prove the said change:

> a)     His remarriage since 2003;

> b)     His unemployment and lack of income since 2006;

> c)     His old age and ill-health;

> d)     The depletion of his assets and

> e)     His move to Indonesia since 2018.

#### The Wife’s Position

9       The Wife’s position was that there is no material change in the circumstances and that her spousal maintenance of $5,000 should continue, or in the alternative, it should be not be rescinded but varied downwards (based on my reading of Paragraph 52 of her counsel’s written submissions) if the Court finds that she had received a windfall of $635,286.58 from the sale of her condominium unit at The Quintet.

10     She stated that she was previously an Executive Secretary and that she had stopped work at the Husband’s request when they got married in 1985; and that she has not worked ever since. She contended that the Husband’s medical conditions are not serious and that he has exhibited no recent medical reports. She asserted that he has a pool of $13.375 million from the sale of his shares from 2000 to 2006, earnings from dividends, bonus and profit sharing in September 2000 and his sale of his landed home in 2017. It was submitted that the Husband has very substantial resources unaccounted for and that he has not given any satisfactory explanation as to what has become of it. In short, the Wife disputed that the Husband has suffered any adverse change in his circumstances which would allow the Court to vary the Consent Order.

#### Assessment of Merits of Husband’s case

11     The Husband is now 70 years old[^2]. The Wife is now 63 years old[^3]. The Husband’s position is that he is no longer able to maintain the Wife as he would not have enough to live on for the rest of his life if he were to continue maintaining her; that he has been unemployed since 2006; that his funds are depleting and all he has left is $1,658,287.29 in savings and assets and that based on his current financial situation, going forward, he is only able to support himself and his 3rd wife (“present wife”), aged 51+ years old[^4].

12     The Husband sold his house at X Taman Siglap and moved with his present wife to Bali, Indonesia for a cheaper cost of living in 2018. He has set out at Paragraph 14 of his first affidavit his monthly expenses in both Singapore and Indonesia along with some supporting documents. More supporting documents for his expenses are exhibited in his second affidavit. In 2018, his expenses in Singapore were $16,438 per month of which 30.4% was the $5,000 maintenance for the Wife. In 2019, his monthly expenses in Bali were $12,284 of which 40.7% comprised the said $5,000 spousal maintenance. Although the Wife challenged his expenses, I find them to be reasonable based on the nature of the expense and the quantum and the standard of living to which he is accustomed. In addition, adequate supporting documents have been exhibited by him.

13     For the Wife to now say that the Husband is prioritising his present wife and himself over her (by no longer providing her with maintenance) gives rise to the inference that she feels she should be prioritised – “It is very obvious that he has decided that his priority should be his himself, his present wife and his future”[^5]. I am of the view that the Wife’s case overreaches if it is her position that she should be the priority in the Husband’s life.

14     In **_George Sapooran Singh v Gordip d/o MD Garsingh_** <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 197</span>, the High Court held at \[39\] that “…While severance of the consortium through divorce does not impact the obligations to the children, at least until they are able to sustain themselves, _the position of the wife is perhaps not quite the same._ In this regard, _it must also be remembered that the purpose of maintenance for the wife from the previous marriage is financial preservation, ie to assist her to transit to a post-divorce life_ as she has been economically disadvantaged by the erstwhile role of homemaker and the consequent reduction or loss of earning capacity.” (emphasis mine)

15     The Wife cannot expect to be the Husband’s priority after the Husband has re-married. The reason for provision for maintenance in the Consent Order was for the Wife to transition to post-divorce life. It is not to insure her for life. She said that she has not worked since her 1985 marriage to the Husband, and after their divorce in 2001, she was unable to re-join the labour force. She claimed that “after insisting that \[she\] should stay at home to look after J, and thereby rendering \[her\] disadvantaged and handicapped in the job market, \[she\] should now have to fend for \[her\]self at this advanced age”.[^6] In contrast, the Husband disagreed that he asked her to stop work and instead contended that it was the Wife who chose to do so[^7].

16     At the point of the divorce in 2001, the Wife was only 43 years old and the parties’ son J would have then been 13 years old. Their son J would not have needed her to be at home full-time to be his caregiver at that age. J would have been away in secondary school most of the day. Even if she had felt that she needed to be at home full-time until her son turned 16 years old, this meant she voluntarily stayed unemployed from 46 years old, apparently without making any effort to re-train herself. By her own admission, it appears that she remained wholly dependent on the $5,000 monthly maintenance to present date. This does not speak well of her efforts to regain financial self-sufficiency, contribute to her own upkeep and to put aside money for her old age.

17     The case of **_Quek Lee Tiam v. Ho Kim Swee (alias Ho Kian Guan)_** <span class="citation">\[1995\] SGHC 23</span> bolsters the position of the Husband. In that case, the High Court declined to award a lump sum amount based on 25 years of spousal maintenance at $19,000 per month as sought by a woman from her wealthy husband whom she was divorcing. In ordering lump sum maintenance to that woman calculated at $12,000 which worked out to be of about 8 years’ duration, Lai Kew Chai J. at \[22\] emphasised the need for the wife there to “exert herself, secure a gainful employment and earn as much as reasonably possible”.

18     The Wife could have re-skilled herself for the job market by using some of the not insubstantial amount of $5,000 she received each month from the Husband to improve her employment prospects and obtain a job so as to gradually shift into post-divorce life. I accept the submission of the Husband’s counsel that upon their divorce, she was free to find gainful employment and that no evidence of any effort to do so has been disclosed by the Wife. I therefore cannot accept the Wife’s claim of being unemployable upon her divorce in her early 40s.

19     I am also persuaded by the Husband’s remarks that the Wife has to take responsibility for herself; that he cannot be expected to maintain her until he is down to his last dollar; that she has had “ample time, opportunity, assets and money to plan her future, affairs and old age”[^8]. Assuming that the Husband’s expenses remain the same at $12,284 with the $5,000 maintenance to the Wife to continue, and assuming that his current funds and assets are indeed $1,658,287.29 (and also assuming that all his assets can be liquidated), this sum will only last for another 11 years and 3 months, bringing the Husband at that point in time to 81 years old, the Wife to 74 years old and the present wife to 62+ years old when all the money runs out.

20     At this juncture, I will address the contemplation of the parties in entering into their agreement. Two important considerations would be whether the Husband made the variation application soon after the Consent Order was granted and if the variation sought by him ought reasonably to be within the contemplation of the parties when they made their agreement.

21     No variation of maintenance was sought by the Husband until this time, over 18 years after he had made the agreement with the Wife. Further, there was no moratorium set by the Consent Order on the duration of time that the Husband was to provide maintenance for the Wife. Both these facts indicate that he had every intention, when the Consent Order was granted, to maintain the Wife indefinitely. For the Husband to have maintained the Wife all through his retirement since 2006 and throughout his remarriage until September 2019 speaks of his bona fide attempt to respect and uphold the Consent Order.

22     It cannot be said, however, that both parties did not contemplate the spousal maintenance coming to an end one day just because no clause was inserted into the Consent Order to specify when spousal maintenance should terminate. Section 119 of the WC specifies that “notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any such agreement” the Court is able to intervene and vary an agreement made even where parties have intended that the order should not be varied. There was no such provision in the Consent Order in this case. It is clear to me that the Consent Order was entered into by the Husband in better times. The Wife ought to have reasonably contemplated that her $5,000 maintenance would not last forever should the Husband’s financial situation change adversely or should he pre-decease her.

23     The better times existing at the time of the Consent Order have given way to the reality that is now. The Husband’s ill health is linked to his loss of employment. He had resigned in 2006 due to a few medical conditions.

24     The Wife claimed that there was no real medical reasons why he had to stop work at 56 years old when he resigned “in the prime of his life”[^9]. Further, she is of the opinion that his purported medical conditions were non-serious and that the Husband’s explanation that he had to resign due to health reasons was “very dubious”[^10].

25     There is a medical report dated 24 July 2006 from a dermatologist whom the Husband consulted in 2004 and 2005 which stated that his dermatitis and urticaria were caused by severe stress[^11]. There is a similar medical report dated 21 July 2006 which stated that due to his recurrent medical conditions, he had to retire on 1 June 2006[^12]. There is a current medical report of 4 December 2019 which shows that he is still on medication for his skin condition[^13]. I accept that he suffers from hypertension and has a chronic skin condition requiring treatment and medication regularly.

26     The Husband has therefore produced sufficient evidence of his ill-health to prove why he took early retirement. In fact, even after he had stopped work as of June 2006, the Husband continued to maintain the Wife without fail for more than 13 years thereafter and I do not think that this is a case of the Husband deliberately staying out of work to deprive the Wife of her maintenance.

27     The Wife’s contention that the Husband has now decided it was time to toss her “out onto the streets” like “a piece of rag”[^14] after she had raised their son does not take into account how he has faithfully maintained her at $5,000 a month for some 18 plus years post-divorce. At 70 years old, the Husband has settled down in Bali in his twilight years with his present wife. He is well into his retirement. It would not be fair, by any measure, to expect him to return to the workforce so as to be able to continue to maintain the Wife.

28     The Husband is supporting his present wife as is his legal obligation. Case law instructs us that remarriage is itself a change in circumstances but that the nature and the extent of the change requires proper examination by the Court before it varies the maintenance order : **_ANH v. ANI_** <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 170</span> at \[5\]. In the present case, the Husband has been married to his present wife for 17 years. He has been maintaining both his present wife and the Wife concurrently since his remarriage on 1 June 2003. The present wife will turn 52 years old at the end of this year and the Husband’s concern in not having enough funds left to provide for her, if he keeps up the $5,000 maintenance to the Wife, is understandable because he is supporting his present wife[^15].

29     Although the Wife claimed that the Husband and his present wife earn income from a business operating two shops in Bali[^16], the Husband explained that his present wife sells bags from tents from the roadside as a hobby[^17]. The photograph of the “shop” exhibited by the Wife (which shows a temporary structure open to the elements) to support her assertion that the present wife is apparently gainfully employed who ostensibly does not require the Husband to support her, actually bolsters what the Husband had said in rebuttal[^18].

30     With respect to his financial standing, the Husband had set out his current savings and assets and had exhibited all the relevant supporting documents in his first affidavit. The Wife claimed that the Husband has hidden away an immense wealth of some $13 million in assets and disbelieves that the total value of his assets to be only $1,658,287.29. In his reply affidavit, the Husband had countered the Wife’s accusations of living a pampered life in the lap of luxury in Bali[^19] and I accept his explanations as they are candid, plausible and rational. He did not deny having come into a large sum of money after the divorce but explained that he made losses over the years and also used the money for his expenditure.

31     It is not inherently incredible that the Husband’s fortune has eroded over the last two decades. I do not agree that he has large reserves “squirrelled away” as repeatedly alleged by the Wife because if he had indeed done this to deprive her of maintenance, he would have applied to vary the order earlier and would not have continued to maintain her for close to two decades. Her counsel’s arguments that “if he was really concerned about his depleting assets, he would have applied for a variation much earlier”[^20] is, with respect, circular.

32     The Court was urged to consider that the Husband “has not produced a single bank account statement to show how much funds are left in his bank account(s)”[^21] and that he has not exhibited any bank statement in his affidavit[^22]. I cannot agree with the Wife’s submissions because, to the contrary, the Husband had exhibited his UOB and Standard Chartered banks’ consolidated statements which showed his current and savings account balances for both as well as other holdings such as a unit trust, CPF monies and SGX shares[^23].

33     The Wife argued that the Husband’s assertions that his funds are depleting was “no more than a bare statement without any supporting evidence of corroboration”[^24] and that he has “failed to make out a factual basis” to prove that there has been a material change in circumstances[^25]. If the Wife was not satisfied with the level of disclosure made by the Husband in his affidavits, then she was at liberty to pursue it - whether by way of interrogatories or otherwise. She did not do so and has instead made unfounded allegations about the Husband’s failure to make full and frank disclosure of his assets.

34     It would be apposite at this stage to deal with the Wife’s level of disclosure of her financial standing. On top of spousal maintenance paid to her over the past 18 over years, the Wife had received her share of the matrimonial assets after the divorce. A modest balance of $4,680.45 in a POSBank account was declared in her first affidavit. The said POSBank account is stated to be her only bank account in her affidavit. What was exhibited in support of this was just a screenshot of an online deposit balance of $4,680.45 with no name nor a corresponding account number[^26].

35     Contrary to what was stated in her affidavit, she is also the account holder of an OCBC Easisave account reflected in the OCBC bank statement[^27] she had exhibited to evidence the mortgage loan of $1,770.60 she paid each month for The Quintet. The mortgage payment is deposited into this Easisave account through another account, a DBS account, to pay the monthly instalment as shown in her first affidavit at pages 77 and 84. This DBS account was also not declared in her affidavit nor were any DBS bank statements exhibited by the Wife. When this point was highlighted by the Husband’s counsel in oral submissions, this was not addressed by the Wife’s lawyer[^28]. All these raises the question of whether the Wife has other funds in undisclosed bank accounts.

36     The Wife would have me believe that she is on the verge of destitution when the Husband stopped the maintenance payments to her in September 2019[^29] but there is little by the way of evidence that she is unable to contribute to her own upkeep. Her claim of being “tossed onto the streets” by the Husband is somewhat over-stated. She had exhibited two cheques[^30] which were purportedly a loan from her brother for $15,000 which she said she had to borrow when she ran short of funds after the Husband stopped paying her maintenance. However, these are just photographs of cheques, as pointed out by the Husband; and there is no evidence that it was banked into her bank account or that she is repaying her brother for the supposed loan.

37     Further, she is not bereft of financial support in her autumn years. Her grown son J still lives with her and he works as a Commis Chef. She has not stated whether or not she is receiving any contribution from him although the Husband has stated that J gives the Wife an allowance[^31]. There is also the fact that she will receive (or already has received) a sum of $635,286.58 as net sale proceeds from the sale of her condominium unit at The Quintet. The completion date of the sale was 9 March 2020. This information was declared in her second affidavit _also dated 9 March 2020_ which still states her address as at The Quintet. This affidavit is oddly silent on where she is presently staying even though the said condominium unit has been sold. No information has been provided on the type of accommodation she is now living in and whether such accommodation was rented or purchased; or whether her current abode is already owned or rented by her prior to the sale of The Quintet. Counsel for the Husband has even suggested that it is likely that the Wife had the benefit of two residences based on the address of a landed property (X Jalan Gumilang) which appears against her name on tax invoices for dental work issued to her from October 2018 to January 2019[^32].

38     Even if the Wife needs to purchase another place to stay, assuming that The Quintet was the only property she held, its net sale proceeds which her counsel described as “represent\[ing\] assets she had built up from division of \[matrimonial\] assets”[^33] can be used to purchase a modest HDB flat free and clear. She will still have a sufficient amount to tide her over for her living expenses if she pares down her expenses and she would be able to ask for some financial support from her son, if he is not already providing her with money.

39     With the sale of The Quintet, her current declared expenses of $5,730.54 will be decreased by its mortgage instalment payments, fire insurance, property tax and the condominium’s management fund payments (totalling $2,105.05); and her personal and household expenses would thus be $3,625.49. Out of this $3,625.49, she has not apportioned between her son and herself the $1,412.37 which comprise her household expenses[^34]. Her household expenses should only be half that ie. $706.18. The only response her counsel had (to explain the lack of apportionment) was that “\[J\] is staying with her and is unmarried and is her only son so she bears all the expenses.”[^35]

40     For her personal expenses which amount to $2,213.12, I am of the opinion that she has inflated some of them. For example, she claimed that she pays $188.50 a month for her GE Supreme Health Insurance by cash, however from her own insurance document, it can be seen that she had paid cash of $967 for the annual premium which works out to $80.58 per month[^36]. She also claimed to spend $350 a month on medication but there are no medical reports stating that she requires medication for the high cholesterol, insomnia/depression, panic attack/seizure etc. which she said she suffers from[^37]. On the whole, I find that the Wife has not been forthright about her actual living expenses and her assets.

41     It is also significant that in both her affidavits and her counsel’s written submissions, no mention is made of how much the Wife would have to spend to purchase a new home since The Quintet has been sold. In the submissions, there appears to be a concession that even if The Quintet’s $635,286.58 net sale proceeds are to be regarded as a windfall by the Court, then this sum, when spread out over the notional remaining years of the Wife’s life, works out to $2,301 per month.

42     In the above calculation of $2,301 per month for the Wife to live on until she is 85 years old, no computation for the purchase or rental of a new home was included in this sum. This is inconsistent with the Wife’s case that she would have to purchase an alternative place of residence.

43     In coming to my decision, I am guided by **_ATS v ATT_** <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 196</span>[^38] at \[13\] that the following 3 conditions must be met before I order any variation of maintenance under section 119 of the WC:

> (a)     the material change asserted by the Husband is a change from circumstances prevailing during the ancillary matters hearing;

> (b)     such change arose after the ancillary matters hearing; and

> (c)     such change is sufficient enough to satisfy me that a variation or recission of maintenance is necessitated.

44     The Court of Appeal in **_BZD v BZE_** <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 1</span> at \[14\] further refined the 3rd condition specified in **_ATS v ATT_** (see \[43\] (c) above) to stipulate that the inquiry undertaken into any material change in circumstances is not whether there has been material change _per se_ since the maintenance order but that the change must be sufficiently material such that it is no longer fair to expect the status quo to remain.

45     In the final analysis, I was persuaded by the forthright way in which the Husband presented his case in his affidavits in which he has proven that his circumstances at the time of entering into the Consent Order had materially changed when compared to his present financial and personal situation. I accepted his declared savings and assets, the computation of his expenses as well as his description of his living conditions in Bali. He had been even-handed and fair-minded in the manner in which he has dealt with the Wife’s allegations of him living the lifestyle of “the rich and famous”[^39] and her accusations of his purported deceptive behaviour. I thus preferred his evidence over that of the Wife’s.

46     From the foregoing, conditions (a) and (b) set out in \[43\] above have been met. Condition (c) has also been established and I am satisfied that the material change pleaded by the Husband is sufficient to necessitate a variation of maintenance such that it would be unfair to allow the $5,000 monthly maintenance to the Wife to continue. Accordingly, I granted Prayer 2(a) in the Husband’s Summons, and ordered that the $5,000 monthly maintenance for the Wife be rescinded with effect from 1 September 2019.

#### Costs Awarded

47     I will now explain my award of costs to the Husband. His counsel submitted that costs of $2,000 should be ordered including the costs for the summons for substituted service to serve the Summons on the Wife. The Wife’s counsel asked for each party to bear its own costs on the ground that any costs ordered would have to come out of her “meagre resources”[^40]. I ordered that the Wife pay costs of $300 for the following reasons.

48     Rule 852 (2) of the Family Justice Rules 2014 sets out the Court’s discretion in ordering costs: _If the Court in its discretion sees fit to make any order as to the costs of or incidental to any proceedings, the Court shall, subject to this Division, order the costs to follow the event, except when it appears to the Court that in the circumstances of the case some other order should be made as to the whole or any part of the costs_.

49     The general guiding principle is that costs generally follow the event, and this principle is grounded in the basis that “a successful party has had to institute proceedings in order to obtain what he deserved. Since the other party’s conduct necessitated the litigation, it is fair that he bears the cost of the litigation” : **_JBB v JBA_** <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 153</span> at \[9\].

50     Although the Husband has fully succeeded in his application to rescind the maintenance agreed upon in the Consent Order, I was well aware the Summons was not taken up against the Wife as a result of any adverse action on her part. I was thus prepared to deviate from the rule of costs following the event. In so doing, I only ordered minimal costs against the Wife for $300 and this was to address the efforts by the Husband who had to obtain an order for substituted service of his Summons where costs in the cause had been granted. Resources had to be engaged by the Husband to bring the Summons to the attention of the Wife which had delayed the proceedings[^41].

#### Recission of spousal maintenance in this case was fair and just in the circumstances

51     The depleting financial assets of the Husband, his lack of income and other income streams, his advanced years and ill-health which preclude employment, and his obligation to maintain his present wife taken together present a genuine material change in the circumstances prevailing at the time of the Consent Order. I am thus satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there should be a recission of spousal maintenance in this case because it is only fair and just to so order in the circumstances.
