Family law – Maintenance

2 November 2020

### District Judge Michelle Elias Solomon:

## Introduction

1       This is an application under Section 71 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) for enforcement of a maintenance order. The Complainant/Wife (“the Wife”) was the former spouse of the Respondent/Husband (“the Husband”).

2       At the time of the hearing, the Husband had defaulted on maintenance payments for a period of ten months prior, making the undisputed quantum of arrears the sum of $15,000. The Husband provided reasons for his non-compliance, taking the position that he had shown cause why the maintenance order should not be enforced. The Wife disagreed with these reasons and sought to enforce the maintenance order.

3       The application came up before me for hearing and I enforced the maintenance order after considering the evidence and submissions of the Husband and Wife (“the Parties”). The Husband, being dissatisfied with my decision, filed a Notice of Appeal.

## Facts

### The parties

4       The Parties were married on 12 September 1962[^1]. The Husband was the Petitioner in Divorce Petition No. xxx of 1993, the Decree Nisi for which was granted on 22 August 1995. The Order of Court in respect of the ancillary matters was granted on 16 April 1996[^2] (“the Ancillary Order”). Clause 1 of the Ancillary Order ordered the Husband to pay the monthly sum of $1,500 to the Wife as her maintenance (“the maintenance order”).

5       In the proceedings before me, the Husband was represented by his litigation representative, Mdm B. She was appointed as the Husband’s litigation representative via an order obtained in separate proceedings under the Mental Capacity Act (Cap 177A, 2010 Rev Ed)[^3] (“the MCA order”). Mdm B is the current wife of the Husband.

## Background to the dispute

6       It was undisputed that the Husband had defaulted on the maintenance payments. According to him, he did not comply because of his worsening mental condition which led to his resignation from work in September 2019[^4]. As he had no income from this date, he ceased complying with the maintenance order. The Wife commenced MSS 3691/2019 on 24 October 2019 (“the enforcement application”) against the Husband seeking to enforce the maintenance order.

7       After the enforcement application was filed, the Husband was assessed to have moderate vascular dementia[^5]. The doctor’s report submitted by the Husband stated that he did not have mental capacity[^6]. His solicitors informed the Court that in view of the Husband’s old age, mental incapacity and unemployment, Mdm B filed an application to rescind the maintenance order on 2 June 2020[^7] (“the variation application”).

## The Parties’ Cases

### Affidavits filed and the conduct of the hearing

8       A total of three affidavits were filed by the Parties in respect of the enforcement application:

> (a)     Wife’s affidavit affirmed on 29 January 2020 (“**W1**”)

> (b)     Wife’s affidavit affirmed on 17 June 2020 (“**W2**”); and

> (c)     Husband’s affidavit affirmed on 24 February 2020 (“**H1**”)[^8].

9       The hearing took place entirely via remote communication technology[^9], with both counsel dispensing with the need for cross-examination since Parties had filed their respective affidavits of evidence-in-chief and the quantum of arrears was undisputed. Parties also consented to receiving my decision via electronic mail following the completion of the hearing.

### The Wife’s Case

10     The Wife contended the Husband’s mental incapacity did not affect his ability to discharge his maintenance obligations[^10]. Further, he had not provided full and frank disclosure of his financial means, a true picture of which would reflect his ability to comply with the maintenance order[^11].

11     In support of her case, the Wife highlighted the following:

> (a)     There was no indication, based on the information provided by the Husband, of the date on which he started to suffer from dementia[^12];

> (b)     It was not plausible that the Husband suffered from dementia in September 2019 because documents from the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) showed that he transferred his company shares on 30 September 2019[^13];

> (c)     She made no comment on the veracity of the medical documents furnished by the Husband in support of his health issues[^14];

> (d)     In respect of the link between the Husband’s mental capacity and his ability to work – it was not clear that this factor _led_ to him not working[^15]; and

> (e)     The Husband’s pending variation application did not operate as a stay of the Ancillary Order.

12     For these reasons, the Wife argued that the maintenance order should be enforced.

### The Husband’s Case

13     The Husband submitted that he was not able to keep up with the payments and had shown cause why the maintenance order should not be enforced because:

> (a)     He was unemployed and no longer able to be employed[^16];

> (b)     He lacked mental capacity, and his prognosis was poor[^17];

> (c)     He suffered from ill health and repeated hospital admissions – he provided various doctor’s notes to this effect[^18]; and

> (d)     His bank account showed that he did not have the means to make the maintenance payments or arrears.

14     For these reasons, the Husband submitted that he had shown cause why the maintenance order should not be enforced.

## Issue to be determined

15     The only issue to be determined was whether the Husband had shown cause why the maintenance order should not be enforced against him.

16     The starting point in determining enforcement applications is s 71 of the Women’s Charter:

> **Enforcement of maintenance order**

> **71.**—(1)    If any person fails to make one or more payments required to be made under a maintenance order, the court which made the order may do all or any of the following:

>> (_a_)    for every breach of the order by warrant direct the amount due to be levied in the manner by law provided for levying fines imposed by a Magistrate’s Court;

>> (_b_)    sentence the person to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one month for each month’s allowance remaining unpaid;

>> (_c_)    make a garnishee order in accordance with the Family Justice Rules made under section 79;

>> (_d_)    order the person to furnish security against any future default in maintenance payments by means of a bankerʼs guarantee which —

>>> (i)    shall be valid for such period (not exceeding 3 years) as the court may determine, starting from the date the order for security is made; and

>>> (ii)   shall be for an amount not exceeding 3 months of maintenance payable under the maintenance order;

>> (_e_)    if the court considers it in the interests of the parties in the maintenance proceedings or their children to do so, order the person to undergo financial counselling or such other similar or related programme as the court may direct;

>> (_f_)    make a community service order requiring the person to perform any unpaid community service for up to 40 hours under the supervision of a community service officer.

> (2)    A sentence of imprisonment ordered under subsection (1)(_b_) shall not affect or diminish the obligation of the person against whom the maintenance order is made to make the payment or payments under the maintenance order which that person has failed to make, except that the court may, if it thinks fit, reduce the amount of any such payments.

> (2A)  The court may make an order under subsection (1)(_d_), (_e_) or (_f_) notwithstanding that any arrears of maintenance which gave rise to the proceedings in which the order is made have been paid up in part or in whole by the time the order is made.

> (2B)  If a person fails to make one or more payments payable under a maintenance order and an order is made by the court under subsection (1) stating the amount of arrears, any of the following persons may lodge a report to a designated credit bureau regarding the unpaid arrears stated on the order of court:

>> (_a_)    the person to or for whom the maintenance is payable;

>> (_b_)    the caregiver of such person; or

>> (_c_)    an authorised representative of such person.

> (2C)  The designated credit bureau may, on receipt of the report referred to in subsection (2B), provide the information, either on its own or consolidated with other information pertaining to the credit payment history of the maintenance defaulter, to the members of the credit bureau.

> (2D)  In this section, “designated credit bureau” means an entity that —

>> (_a_)    collects and maintains information about the credit payment history of a person and provides such information to its members for the purpose of enabling its members to assess the creditworthiness of a person; and

>> (_b_)    has been designated by the Minister as a credit bureau for the purposes of receiving a report lodged under subsection (2B).

> (2E)  For the avoidance of doubt, a community service order made by the court under subsection (1)(_f_) shall be deemed not to be a community service order made under the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (Act 15 of 2010) and sections 346 to 352 of that Act shall not, except as may be provided in this section, apply to a community service order made under subsection (1)(_f_).

> (2F)  An order made by the court under subsection (1) shall state the name, Singapore identity card number, contact number and address of the person who has defaulted on any maintenance payment and the complainant, except where the court determines it would be inappropriate to do so in any particular case.

> (3)    A maintenance order made by the High Court may be enforced by a Family Court in accordance with subsection (1) as if that order had been made by the Family Court, except that a Family Court shall have no power to vary an order of the High Court.

17     Preliminarily, the Husband took the view that the enforcement application should not proceed before the variation application and requested that both applications be fixed for hearing together. I took the view that since the enforcement application was already fixed for hearing before me, it could, and should, proceed. The Husband accepted this position[^19].

18     I also had regard to the Family Justice Rules 2014 (S 813/2014) r 117(1) (emphasis mine):

> **Variation proceedings**

> **117.**—(1)    Unless the Court otherwise directs, _variation proceedings in respect of a maintenance order shall not operate as a stay of enforcement proceedings in respect of that maintenance order_.

> (2)    Where an application for the variation of a maintenance order under Part VIII or X of the Act and an application for the enforcement of a maintenance order under Part VIII of the Act have been filed in respect of the same maintenance order, the Court may at any stage of the proceedings —

>> (_a_)    if it thinks just, direct that both applications be heard together; and

>> (_b_)    give such other directions as it thinks necessary for the just, expeditious and economical disposal of the proceedings.

> (3)    Rules 114 and 115 apply where the applications referred to in paragraph (2) are directed to be heard together

19     At the hearing, I was informed that service of the variation application had been effected on the Wife, and a Pre-Trial Conference had been scheduled[^20].

### Whether the Husband had shown cause why the maintenance order should not be enforced against him

20     It was undisputed that the Husband had failed to comply with the maintenance order. He was aware of his obligations but ceased payments suddenly in September 2019, precipitating the current application. While he may have had his reasons for being unable to keep up with the maintenance payments, the decision did not lie with him to unilaterally cease complying with the order. Accepting this conduct, in my view, sets a troublesome precedent for similar applications – one that suggests that parties need not comply with a court order if _they_ consider it difficult to do so, and further, such conduct could be sufficient grounds for cause to be shown why an order should not be enforced. This cannot be the case.

21     The Husband’s basis for not complying with the maintenance order was that there had been a material change of circumstances since the Ancillary Order was made, and that there was good cause for the court to order a rescission of the said order[^21]. However, a rescission of the maintenance order was not within the scope of the current application. I was therefore unable to accept this as sufficient cause as to why the maintenance order should not be enforced.

22     In determining whether the Husband had shown cause why the maintenance order should not be enforced against him, I also considered his means and ability to pay the arrears.

23     On this issue, the Wife contended as follows:

> (a)     The bank statements provided by the Husband did not paint a true and accurate reflection of his financial means because the statements should have reflected his salary deposits, maintenance payments to her and proceeds from the sale of his company shares. The fact that these transactions were not reflected anywhere showed that the Husband had other bank accounts which he had not disclosed. Given that these were show cause proceedings, the Husband was responsible for proving that he lacked the financial means to make the necessary payments[^22];

> (b)     The Husband had failed to provide full and frank disclosure; and

> (c)     The court should draw an adverse inference against the Husband for this failure.

24     The Husband, in his support of his case that he lacked the means or ability to pay the arrears, contended as follows:

> (a)     Based on the balances in the bank accounts disclosed by him in the enforcement proceedings, he did not have the means to make the maintenance payments;

> (b)     Under the MCA order, there was authority given to Mdm B to manage only one bank account, which was an account held jointly by the Husband and Mdm B, and there was no room to doubt that this is the only bank account that the Husband had[^23]; and

> (c)     in the event that the Wife had queries about proceeds from business transactions and where his salary was deposited each month, she could have made further requests for discovery, but had not[^24].

25     The difficulty with the Husband’s arguments is that he sought to persuade me that the extent of his means was limited to _one_ bank account – the one that Mdm B had authority over. I was unable to agree with this submission for the following reasons.

26     The Husband’s affidavit evidence did not state that he _only_ owned this _one_ bank account. In fact, the Husband’s evidence did not disclose _any_ bank statements – it was the _Wife_ who exhibited the bank statements provided by the Husband following her requests for discovery and interrogatories.

27     In his evidence, the Husband simply stated that the maintenance order should be rescinded because he ceased work since September 2019 and explains why he stopped working. He did not:

> (a)     Offer evidence of his means, save for a copy of his Notice of Assessment 2019, which shows income earned in 2018[^25];

> (b)     State, on affidavit, the number of bank accounts he owned and the balances in each of these accounts; or

> (c)     Explain why he was unable to pay the arrears, including why and how this was linked to his cessation of work.

28     I also agreed with the Wife’s submission that there were other transactions, like his salary deposits, maintenance payments and sale proceeds from his company shares, that were missing from the statements that were provided to her[^26], which led to the conclusion that there were other undisclosed accounts.

29     The Husband’s response to these assertions was that there was no request made for these documents in the first place, and as such, the Wife accepted that the issue of the Husband’s alleged assets were irrelevant to the enforcement of maintenance[^27]. Further, since the Wife’s counsel declined the opportunity to cross-examine Mdm B on this issue, there was no scope for the court to draw an adverse inference[^28].

30     I was unable to accept this response because if the Husband’s case was that he lacked the means to pay the arrears, he bore the burden of proving this. The burden _did not_ lie with the Wife to make further requests for discovery and interrogatories or conduct cross-examination in order to uncover a trail of information that might lead to the discovery of other accounts which could contain salary deposits or cash proceeds from the sale of his shares. This was not the nature or purpose of enforcement proceedings.

31     There was also no necessity to draw an adverse inference because the burden to show cause why the maintenance order should not be enforced lay with the Husband, not the Wife, and based on the evidence and submissions, he had not discharged this burden.

32     Finally, there was no order staying the payment of maintenance and the variation application did not operate a stay of the enforcement application; rule 117(1) of the Family Justice Rules states this explicitly. The maintenance order therefore remained enforceable until varied or rescinded.

33     For these reasons, I was of the view that the arrears remained payable by the Husband and he had not shown cause why the maintenance order should not be enforced against him.

## Conclusion

34     The enforcement application was filed over eight months prior to the hearing. This presented, in my view, a significant period of non-compliance with the maintenance order. The variation application will be separately determined on its merits – in the meantime, the Wife was entitled to maintenance under an order which was valid and enforceable.

35     For these reasons, I allowed the enforcement application and made orders for the payment of the arrears in two instalments of $7,500 each, with costs payable to the Wife fixed at $3,000.
