Guardianship of Infants Act – Variation of Custody Care and Control – Personal Protection Order – Family Violence – Choice of School

26 March 2019

### District Judge Goh Zhuo Neng:

## A.   INTRODUCTION

1       This matter concerns an ongoing battle for the custody, care and control for a Child. The Plaintiff Father (“**Father**”) and the Defendant Mother (“**Mother**”) have been living separately since 24 December 2016, when the Mother left the matrimonial home in the west of Singapore (“**West Property**”) with the Child, to live with her parents in the east of Singapore (“**East Property**”).

2       The Father eventually filed his own application in 13 July 2018 in OSG153 of 2017 (“**OSG**”). I heard the OSG on 9 November 2017, and granted the Father access with the Child, which was to begin on 13 November 2017, which would transition to overnight weekend access from 4 December 2017. I also ordered the Father to pay the Mother the sum of $900.00 a month in maintenance for the Child. The full terms of my order in the OSG (“**Order**”) are set out at **Annex A**.

3       On 5 May 2018, the Mother observed wounds on the Child’s arm which the Child claimed were caused by the Father burning him (“**May Burning Incident**”). The matter was escalated to Child Protection Services (“**CPS**”), but I understand that while parties entered into a Voluntary Care Agreement, there was no more follow up from CPS.

4       On 3 July 2018, the Father filed SUM2203 of 2018 (“**SUM2203**”). In this application, he was seeking a reversal of care and control to him with regular unsupervised access to the Mother. The Father was also seeking maintenance of $500.00 a month from the Mother, and for the Child to be enrolled in a primary school of his choice, which he indicated was one near the West Property (“**West School**”).

5       On 18 July 2018, the Father found a wound on the Child. He alleged that the Child had told him the Maternal Grandmother had burnt the Child. On this occasion, the Child told the Father that the wounds were caused by the Maternal Grandmother burning him (“**July Burning Incident**”). This resulted in the Father retaining the Child beyond the period of his permitted access under the Order.

6       On 20 July 2018, the Father filed summonses SS 1571, 1572 and 1573 of 2018, seeking for Personal Protection Orders (“**PPOs**”) to be made against the Mother, the Maternal Grandmother and the Maternal Grandfather to prevent them from committing family violence against the Child.

7       On 23 July 2018, the Mother filed SUM2563 of 2018, seeking an immediate return of the Child. I heard this application on 24 July 2018, and ordered that the Father return the Child the next day on 25 July 2018. The Father complied.

8       On 24 July 2018, the Father filed SUM2508 of 2018 (“**SUM2508**”). SUM2508 sought essentially the same relief as SUM2203, save that the Father was seeking to reduce the Mother’s access to supervised access once a week at a divorce support specialist agency. In this application, the Father placed much reliance on the July Burning Incident.

9       On 22 October 2018, the Mother filed SUM3774 of 2018 (“**SUM3774**”). Here, the Mother was seeking for an increase in maintenance contributions by the Father for the Child, for the Father to undergo a psychiatric assessment, and for the Child to be enrolled in a primary school near the East Property (“**East School**”).

10     On 14 December 2018, parties appeared before me for the trial of the PPOs. I note there was a significant overlap between the facts relied on in SUM2203, SUM2508 and the PPOs. On 27 December 2018, I heard the above applications and closing submissions for the PPOs. I then ordered that:

a)     The Mother will be authorised to decide on the choice of school for the Child for the purposes of the P1 Registration Exercise 2018, or the primary school that the Child is to be placed in. The Mother shall register the Child in the primary school of choice and the Father shall execute the necessary documents to facilitate the said registration within 24 hours of being provided with them.

b)     The Child and the Parents both attend counselling at Children in Between.

c)     The PPOs be dismissed, with the Father to pay the Mother costs of $3,000.00 ordered for all 3 applications ($1,000.00 per application).

d)     SUM2203 and SUM 2580 to be dismissed, with the Father to pay the Mother costs of $2,000.00 for both applications ($1,000.00 per application).

e)     Prayers 1 and 2 of SUM3774 of 2018 to be dismissed, with no orders as to costs.

11     On 3 January 2019, the Father filed a Notice of Appeal against my decisions in SUM2203, SUM2580, SUM 3774 – insofar as I had authorised the Mother to decide on the Child’s choice of school (“**Summonses**”) and the PPOs. For completeness, I set out my decision in respect of the PPOs and the Summonses that the Father was appealing against. Copies of the prayers under the Summonses are set out at **Annex B**.

## B.   THE INCIDENTS

12     In respect of the PPOs and his applications, the Father was essentially relying on the same incidents to establish that he should be given care and control of the Child, and that a PPO should be ordered against the Mother and her parents.

13     These incidents centred on the alleged neglect of the Child by the Mother, and 2 incidents of alleged family violence towards the Child. I will address my findings in the key incidents below.

## I.   Insect Bites

14     The Father pointed out that on the first date of access (15 November 2017), he observed insect bites on the Child’s leg and rashes on the Child’s shoulder, neck and chest. Over the course of the next few months, he continued to observe the Child and continued to detect bites on the Child’s ankles and legs. A list of the dates on which the Father observed these bites are set out below.

a)     15 and 25 November 2017

b)     7 and 9 February 2018

c)     26 April 2018

15     The Father claimed that the bites were the result of neglect by the Mother, which on occasion resulted in the Father having to take the Child to hospital for treatment. The Mother explained that the Child was active, and that she had applied lotion to the bites. However, prevention was a little problematic as the Child was averse to its smell and refused to apply insect repellent.

16     My view of the matter was that the Father was overreacting. A study of the dates where the Father observed insect bites show that he made his observations on 3 separate weeks (as he had access twice a week). There were 2 month gaps between each week, which suggested that the incidents were not as frequent or serious as the Father imagined them to be. Aside from the bites and marks on the Child’s legs, there were also no serious infections, or violent reactions to the bites that were reported.

## II.   Bruised Toe

17     On 15 November 2017, the Father also found a bruise on the Child’s right big toe. This was the first day that the Father was taking access to the Child after my Order. The Child was taken to a medical clinic on 18 November 2017 and the injury was diagnosed as a subungal hematoma.

18     The Father attributed this to the Mother’s negligence. The Mother explained that she was aware of the injury and said that the Child had told her it happened in school. The Father said that he had asked his lawyers to write to the Child’s school, who confirmed that the school did not observe the Child suffering any injury to his right toe in school, and that the Child did not complain to any of the staff about a pain or injury to his foot or toe during school hours.

19     I took the view that this was an unremarkable incident. The bruise may have appeared severe, but the Child did not complain of any pain to the Father or the Mother.

## III.   Sudden Fever

20     On 4 December 2017, the Child was unwell and came down with a fever and cough. The Mother took him to the doctor who prescribed medicine. This medicine was administered. The Mother states that by 8 December 2017, which was the date of the Father’s access, the fever had subsided. She handed over 2 bottles of cough mixture to the Father’s sister, who was helping with the handover. While the Child was in the car, the Father says that the Child started getting warm and was taken to hospital where he was diagnosed with a fever.

21     Given the sudden upturn in the Child’s temperature, the Father blamed the Mother for her negligence. I took the view that while the sudden rise in the Child temperature was inexplicable, it was not clear that this had gone undetected as a result of negligence. The Mother had done her part by taking the Child to the doctor on 4 December 2017 to address the fever, and had subsequently administered the medicine given. While the Child might have been turning warmer as the Father’s access drew closer, it would not naturally have occurred to the Mother that this was the result of a fever escalating. After all she had administered the fever medication provided by the doctor on 4 December 2017, and it was only natural to assume that the fever had been addressed.

## IV.   The Burning Incidents

#### May Burning Incident

22     It was necessary to consider the May Burning Incident first, in order to fully appreciate the significance of the July Burning Incident which involved allegations against the Maternal Grandmother.

23     The May Burning Incident was first detected by the Mother. According to her, she took the Child back for access from the Father on 5 May 2018, and detected four reddish marks on the Child’s right forearm that looked like insect bites. The Child informed her that the Father had burnt him.

24     On 6 May 2018, three of the marks were no longer red but one of the marks had turned darker in colour. On 7 May 2018, the Mother received a call from the Child’s school who informed her that the Child had reported to the teachers that the Father had burnt him. The matter was then escalated to CPS, and parties entered into a voluntary care agreement.

25     The Father denied having burnt the Child and blamed the Mother for leading CPS and the Child’s school into thinking that the Child was burnt. The Mother’s text message to the Child’s school teacher during this period show that the Mother _did not believe_ that the Child’s wound was a burn, and that the matter was escalated to CPS as part of the school’s processes. An excerpt of their conversation is set out below.

26     The Child was seen by a doctor, who diagnosed the injury as a non-incidental injury. However, the doctor was not able to diagnose what caused the injury. Given the paucity of evidence here, I am reluctant to accept the doctor’s view that the injury was non-incidental, or to go even further to make the finding that the Father burnt the Child.

#### July Burning Incident

27     This brings us to the July Burning Incident. The Father detected a wound on the Child’s left forearm. The Child told the Father that the Maternal Grandmother had placed the Child’s arm over the fire and burnt it. The Father produced a video where the Child is seen repeating this allegation.

28     The Father subsequently lodged a police report, and retained the Child, who was sent to hospital. Notably, there was no diagnosis of the injury. It is unclear what caused the injury, or even whether it was a burn.

#### Analysis of both Burning Incidents

29     Looking at both incidents, there are some stark similarities. They both concerned marks found on the Child’s forearms. The Child claimed they were burns, although it has never been established that the marks were burns. The Child claimed that a caregiver had burnt him, and these allegations were levelled at caregivers on both sides.

30     These facts suggest that the burns were in fact, not burns. Consequently, the Child’s allegations in this regard cannot be given much credit. The fact that he would make these allegations against caregivers from both sides suggests that the Child was aware that these allegations would be taken seriously on both sides.

31     What the Child intended to achieve by making these allegations is unclear. However, with no history by either party or their caregivers of abuse to the Child, I was not minded to believe that the May or July Burning Incidents involved abuse of the Child.

## V.   Horizontal Lifting Incident

32     On 23 May 2017, the Father was taking access to the Child. He was waiting at the ground floor of the Mother’s block of apartments at the East Property while his Mother went upstairs to pick up the Child from the East Property.

33     While he was waiting, the Father heard a commotion coming from upstairs. He rushed up to the Mother’s apartment and saw the Maternal Grandfather holding the Child in a horizontal position and lifting him out of the East Property and into the common corridor. He shouted at the Maternal Grandfather to stop, and the Maternal Grandfather lowered the Child down.

34     The Father alleged that this was a violent act which endangered the Child, which was directed to coerce the Child into wearing his sandals. Prior to 23 May 2017, both parties were embroiled in a dispute over the tightness of new sandals that the Mother had bought for the Child, which resulted in the back of the shoes being cut by the Father to make them easier for the Child to put on.

35     The Paternal Grandfather mentioned on the stand during the PPO trial that on 23 May 2018, the Child did not want to go for access. He was not sure why, but attributed it to the Child being engrossed in playing with his toys. Hence the Paternal Grandfather had to lift the Child in order to get him out of the East Property and ready for access.

36     I found the Paternal Grandfather’s version of events more credible. First, it was not clear how the lifting of the Child could be seen as part of a coercive tactic to make him put on his ill-fitting shoes.

37     The Father did not see the Paternal Grandfather force the shoes on the Child. He did not hear the Child complain loudly at the time about having to wear the shoes. In my view, it was the Father’s attempt to shoehorn the Paternal Grandfather’s actions to fit his allegations that was ill-fitting. The Paternal Grandfather’s actions were a tactic of last resort to get the Child out of the East Property and off to access with the Father.

## VI.   Booster Seat

38     The Father also complained that the Child was being endangered by the Mother’s failure to install a booster seat in the Paternal Grandfather’s car. In support of this allegation, he provided pictures he had taken of the car’s interior showing that there was no booster seat installed, and pictures of the Paternal Grandfather walking away from the Child with no booster seat in hand.

39     The explanation given by the Mother was simple. There was a booster seat installed when the Child was in the car. However, when the Child was not using the seat, it would be placed in the boot, or carried upstairs. This accounts for the Father being unable to obtain pictures of the booster seat in the car. Notably, the Father was not able to obtain pictures of a booster seat not being installed when the Child was travelling in the car. I accepted the Mother’s explanation.

## VII.   Child’s Loss of Weight

40     The Father claimed that when he picked up the Child on 18 November 2018, he weighed the Child at 16.1kg. With the Child’s height at 110cm, this gave the Child a Body to Mass Index rating (“**BMI**”) of 13.3, requiring him to gain 6.29kg to 14.03 kg in order to reach a normal BMI. Pictures of the Child prior to moving in with the Mother and the current pictures of the Child were provided to illustrate the Child’s loss of weight.

41     The Mother explained that the Child was always on the smaller side, and stated that the Child’s weight had gone up to 17.6kg since SUM2203 was filed.

42     While the Child appeared to be on the skinnier side, it was not clear to me that his weight and size was the consequence of malnourishment. That was an evaluation to be properly made by a paediatrician after a complete body check-up.

## VIII.   Other Injuries/ “Bad People”

43     The Father also observed other injuries on the Child in August 2018. These injuries amounted to marks on the Child’s head (15 August 2018), bruises on the Child’s shin and a scratch on the Child’s torso (17 August 2018), a bruise on the Child’s left knee cap (31 August 2018) When the Father took the Child to a doctor (17 August 2018) and asked the Child to explain the cause of his injuries, the Child was uncomfortable.

44     Without more, it cannot be assumed that the injuries were the result of abuse. The Father was not able to provide a medical report to show that the injuries were serious or caused by a 3rd party. Given the manner in which every mark on his body was being scrutinised, the Child’s reluctance to talk to the Father about these bruises and marks was understandable.

45     Notably, when the Father observed that the Child was _“clamming up”_ at the doctors, instead of trying to calm the Child down, he viewed the situation as a _“teachable moment”._ His reaction as set out in paragraph 15 of his affidavit dated 14 September 2018 is set out below.

_“I viewed the situation as a ‘teachable moment’ and seized the opportunity to help (Child) learn, in an engaging manner, his rights as a child by introducing to him the booklet titled “United Nation convention on the rights of the child’. Being an inquisitive child who has learnt to enjoy our teaching-and-learning sessions together, I was heartened to see (Child) being captivated and immersed by the contents of the booklet. However, what surprised me was when (Child) requested for a pen whilst we were reading the part of the booklet that states “Every Child has the right to protection from abuse and neglect by parents or caregivers…”. Without prompting (Child) wrote on the page the statements “I want to stay at pioneer (Child). My heart broke. This was precisely what I did not want (Child) to experience.” Photos of (Child) and me reading the booklet and the booklet with (Child’s) handwritten statements are exhibited herein at Tab H of “JLCC-1”._

46     This was not the only occasion, in which the Father was able to enable the Child in making statements in support of his applications. I will elaborate.

47     In his application, the Father explained that the Child had now taken to calling the Maternal Grandparents “_bad people_” in mandarin and alleged that they were not giving him enough food, and ill-treating him. In support of his allegation, the Father enclosed a video that he had taken of the Child on 8 May 2018, when the Child was warded in hospital following the escalation of the May Burning Incident to CPS.

Ah. Okay.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Child: You close the gate. There.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Father: Okay.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(emphasis in bold added)</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

48     This video amounted to clear evidence that the Father was teaching the Child what to say. Assuming that the Child was speaking spontaneously and truthfully, why would the Father need to proffer the threat of an encounter with the _“bad people”_? Why would he need to suggest to the Child that he was a policeman?

49     These videos and pictures were not the only examples of media cited by the Father as evidence. The Father submitted a remarkable quantity of pictures and videos showing him playing with the Child, teaching the Child, taking the Child on various activities in the community, the Child’s alleged reluctance to go back to the Mother’s home, as well as pictures of the Maternal Grandparents which appeared to be taken without their notice and from an opposite block of flats.

50     What the Father _did not_ provide in evidence was the surveillance reports of a private investigator, which he had engaged to tail the Maternal Grandparents and the Mother. In the Father’s words: _“Although engaging a private investigator was taxing on my financial resources, I did not mind because it gave me a peace of mind knowing that somebody was watching over (Child). I eventually stopped the services of the private investigator as it was plainly unsustainable financially and (Child) was usually kept indoors.”_

51     While it was heartening to know that the Father cared deeply for the welfare of the Child, the extent to which he was indulging his own concerns by case building was not in the best interests of the Child.

## IX.   Other Incidents

52     In support of his application, the Father made references to other incidents involving the Child, namely:

a)     The Child suffering from excema which the Father attributed to the lack of child appropriate shampoo or shower gel by the Mother.

b)     The use of orange lighting in the East Property, which was bad for a reading child.

c)     The Child crying while watching poachers separate a young lion from his pride in the cartoon “_Madagascar_”.

d)     The Child asking to be returned to his former kindergarten.

e)     The Child’s sitting on a toilet bowl to urinate, which the Father attributed to emasculation by the Mother.

f)     The Child’s hair and toenails not being cut frequently. The Father would then have to cut the Child’s hair and toenails himself.

g)     The Child receiving a bad haircut which traumatised him and had to be remedied by the Father.

h)     The Child’s complaint that he did not have enough toys (the Mother provided a picture showing a room full of toys)

i)     The Child suffering from a runny nose in the mornings.

j)     The Father’s discovery of items in the West Property that he believes were stolen by the Mother from her previous employer.

53     I did not regard any of these incidents as being extraordinary. They amounted to a nit picking of mundane incidents in order to bolster the Father’s narrative of neglect.

## C.   Did the Incidents Justify the Granting of a PPO?

54     It was submitted by the Father that above incidents amounted to neglect by the Mother and the Maternal Grandparents, which formed sufficient basis for a PPO.

#### The Law

55.    Sections 64, and 65 of the Women’s Charter defines “_family violence_” as the commission of any of the following acts:

(a)     wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;

(b)     causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;

(c)     wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his will; or

(d)     causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member.

56     “_Hurt_” as referred to in (a) and (b) above means “_bodily pain, disease or infirmity_”. The Women’s Charter also clarifies that “_family violence_” does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age.

57     Key to the above, is a deliberate intention to cause family violence, as the granting of a PPO is intended to protect a family member from harm caused deliberately by another family member.

#### The Father’s submissions and my findings

58     It was submitted by the Father’ counsel that the incidents relied on by the Father amounted to wilful and deliberate neglect of the Child.

59     I was unable to agree with that view. As stated above in my assessment of the incidents, these incidents were exactly that – incidents. They were not caused by a desire for the Child to suffer hurt. They were just incidents that occur in the life of a young active child. It would have been cynical to view them as deliberate acts of family violence.

60     I will touch on two specific allegations which involved direct physical contact with the Child.

a)     Horizontal Lifting – I was of the view this was simply an example of discipline which is permitted under the Women’s Charter. While the Maternal Grandfather’s actions were unorthodox, it must have at the time seemed like the most obvious thing to do in order to get a stubborn child out of the house to meet his Father. There was nothing excessively punitive in what the Maternal Grandfather did.

b)     July Burning Incident – I was of the view that this incident did not occur, despite what the Child had been filmed saying. This was not the first time the Child had claimed he was being “burned” by a caregiver – even though there was no evidence to show that the Child had actually been burned. There was no real substance to these allegations, which had never been backed up by sufficient medical evidence.

61     In the circumstances, the PPOs were dismissed as there was in my view, no family violence.

## D.   Should Care and Control be Reversed to the Father?

62     The Father’s submission in essence was that the Mother’s household was a cradle of child abuse and neglect.

63     As mentioned above, I found no abuse and no neglect. What I did find, was that the Father was not completely innocent. He was deliberately involving the Child in his case building efforts, which was unfortunate. Behind the actions, I could sympathise with the intention to give the Child the best possible upbringing and care. But by incessantly case building, he proved that it was possible to cause harm while intending to do good.

64     How must it feel to be a child subject to constantly scrutiny and checking at each handover to the Father? To be constantly photographed and videoed so that each milestone and achievement can be logged down and filed away in a thick lengthy affidavit? I imagine it must be stifling.

65     In seeking to establish themselves as the worthier caregiver, parents can get caught up in the legal process, and this case is a very good example of that – the citing of multiple mundane incidents, a proliferation of contrived photographs. This only exacerbates the child’s awareness of being caught in the middle of a dispute and that every minute detail of his life will be pored over by a parent for use in legal proceedings.

66     If I were to allow a variation, it would be a ringing endorsement of the Father’s conduct. I would be sending a message that it is par for the course for any parent to do the same. This would not bode well for children who are the subject of custody proceedings.

67     Accordingly, I dismissed the Father’s applications for variation of care and control under SUM2203 and SUM2580. Consequently, there was no need for me to order the Mother to pay the Father maintenance under these summonses. To help the parties and the Child in navigating this difficult period, I also ordered that they attend Children in Between counselling sessions.

## F.   Where shall the Child go to School and Who gets to decide?

68     This left one final question to be decided – Where shall the Child go to school and who gets to decide?

69     The parties’ positions could not have been further apart. The Mother wanted the Child to attend the East School, which was near where the Child currently lived in the East Property. The Father wanted the Child to attend the West School.

70     By the time the applications were heard, the Primary 1 Registration Exercise (which takes place in July to August every year) had already concluded. However, the Child was not yet placed in a school as parties had not been able to reach an agreement.

71     The Mother explained that she did not need to send the Child to a top ranked school as she believed he had learning difficulties and would not be able to keep up. It was easier for the Child to just go schooling somewhere near to the East Property. She also added that the East School also had a high number of Allied Educators who would be able to address the Child’s learning disability – although this was not substantiated.

72     The Father stated that if the Child were to go to the East School, this would strengthen the Mother’s argument that the Child should not be removed from the East Property. That was the Father’s strongest argument, and it was also one that cut both ways. By seeking to place the Child in the West School, the Father would also be able to support an argument that the Child should live in its proximity in the West Property.

73     The Father also cited the Mother’s delay in filing SUM3744 in October 2018 after the registration exercise had lapsed. This was contrasted with the Father’s own action to file SUM2203 in July 2018 while the registration exercise was ongoing. In my view, neither parent had acted admirably. There was no evidence of any party initiating a discussion on this subject from the date of my Order (in November 2017) and up till when the registration exercise begin in July 2018.

74     At this point, it was fruitless to lay blame on any party. The question to be answered was what decision would be in the best interests of the Child? I believed that the Mother should be given the right to decide at this stage, for the following reasons:

a)     At present, it was not meaningful to compare the different merits of either school, academically. Neither party had provided sufficient evidence of why one school would be a better choice in that regard. Hence I focused on the relative proximity of each school as well as the urgent need to enrol the Child in a primary school for 2019 – there were only 2 more working days left in 2018 at the time of my decision.

b)     Given that the care and control would remain with the Mother at this point, the Child would be living in the East Property, but attending school in the west if I granted the Father the right to make that decision. There would be an unnecessarily long amount of travel for the Child, with no obvious benefit to the Child.

c)     On the other hand, the Mother’s intention was to enrol the Child in a school in the vicinity of where the Child lived. That would suffice for now to ensure that the Child could begin his primary education without any further delay.

75     To ensure that the Mother would not be limited to selecting the Child’s school within the very limited timelines in 2018, I also added without qualification that the Mother would have the right to choose which primary school the Child would be enrolled in. This would enable her to make a choice for the Child’s primary school in 2019. To ensure that this process would be expedited, the Father would be required to sign the necessary documents within 24 hours of being provided with them.

## G.   CONCLUSION AND COSTS

76     For the foregoing reasons, I made all the above orders. On the issue of costs, I disapproved of the approach taken by the Father in the applications and in the PPOs. Enough has been said above, and the appropriate measure was for the Father to pay costs of $1,000.00 to the Mother for each of his applications that were dismissed – a total of $5,000.00. As the Mother had only partially succeeded in SUM3744, I made no orders as to costs.
