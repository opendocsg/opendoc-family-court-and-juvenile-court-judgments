Family law – Personal protection order

20 January 2020

### District Judge Guy Ghazali:

## Introduction

1       The present application is an application for personal protection order (“PPO”) for two children who are 11 (female) and 9 (male) years old. The Complainant is the mother of the children while the Respondent is their father.

2       Both the Complainant and the Respondent have been embroiled in very contentious and acrimonious litigation since 2016. Matters relating to the children have been central to their disputes.

3       Parties have ceased living together since May 2016. Under the present court orders, the Mother has care and control of the two children while the Father has access to them. As matters stand, divorce proceedings (including the Respondent’s appeal on the ancillary matters orders) have recently concluded and Final Judgment has been extracted. However, the children issues continue to be a bone of contention between the parties.

## The alleged incidents of family violence

4       The Complainant’s present application rested on three primary incidents, namely, the incident of 11 November 2017, the incident of 8/9 March 2019 and the incident of 26 April 2019. The Complainant also relied on the matters raised in a police report dated 27 May 2019, which listed the name of the elder child as the “informant”.

##### (i)    The alleged incident of 11 November 2017

5       It was the Complainant’s case that on or around 11 November 2017, the elder child, \[S\] complained that the Respondent had hit her head. The Complainant then took \[S\] to the clinic.

6       The Complainant produced a contemporaneous medical memo of their visit to the clinic on 12 November 2017. The medical memo dated 12 November 2017 reads:

> “_This young lady came with mother._

> _\[R\]ight sided of head was hit by her father’s hand yesterday – she said it was painful. \[D\]id not fall._

> _\[N\]ow \[complained of\] headache and giddy._

> _\[S\]calp – no obvious swelling seen._

> _\[N\]eck full \[range of motion\]._

> _\[P\]arameter normal._

> _\[G\]ait normal._

> _…..”_

7       The Respondent denied the allegation. In response, the Respondent highlighted that the alleged incident took place about two years ago and no application for PPO was taken out at that time. Since the alleged incident, the Respondent continued to have regular access to the children including an overseas trip to Bangkok in December 2018. The Respondent further submitted that neither the Complainant nor the doctor who attended to \[S\] was present on the day of the alleged incident on 11 November 2017. Even on the basis of the medical memo, it was the Respondent’s contention that the medical memo did not observe any abnormality or injury. The Respondent also produced a witness at trial who testified that the children were observed to be interacting happily with the Respondent on 11 November 2017. The Respondent’s witness who I will refer to herein as Mr. \[T\] is the Respondent’s cell group leader.

##### (ii)    The alleged incidents of 8 and 9 March 2019

8       The Complainant’s relevant evidence in this respect started from 5 March 2019. According to the Complainant, she had brought \[S\] to the clinic on that day as \[S\] had “difficulty breathing”. According to the Complainant, she allowed \[S\] to be in the doctor’s room alone to be interviewed by the doctor. The Complainant only entered the room when the doctor wanted to speak to her. According to the Complainant, prior to that day, \[S\] had been complaining of episodes of yelling and verbal abuses received from her father (the Respondent).

9       The Complainant produced a medical memo dated 5 March 2019 from \[F\] Family Medicine Clinic (“FMC”). The memo was addressed to the Emergency Medicine Department (“EMD”) of the National University Hospital (“NUH”) (in the event that \[S\] had to be sent to the hospital if her condition worsened). The said memo reads:

> _“Dear EMD colleague_,

> _Please kindly assess \[S\] and assess if she is in need of a safe environment._

> _She attended \[F\] FMC on 5/3/19 for \[shortness of breath\] 2 (sic) anxiety due to fear of interaction with her father. There is a court order for co-parenting and she is under her father’s case from \[T\]hursday to \[S\]aturday._

> _Thank you for your kind expertise.”_

10     On the doctor’s advice, the Complainant brought \[S\] to a polyclinic the next day to obtain a referral to NUH’s psychiatry department. In this regard, the Complainant produced an e-referral dated 6 March 2019 issued by the polyclinic to the Psychiatry Department of NUH, referring \[S\] for “anxiety disorder with recurrent hyperventilation”. The e-referral reads:

> _“came brought in by mother_

> _noted by mother to be having \[shortness of breath\] and hyperventilation, worsening since 3 months ago_

> _getting worse_

> _was seen by FMC yesterday and noted for referral to psych by polyclinic_

> _\[shortness of breath\] is normally when \[patient\] interacts with father or when \[patient\] thinks about father_

> _daughter expressed frustration with father’s preference over younger brother_

> _noted insomnia and appetite getting worse_

> _nil thought of self harm so far_

> _had suicide ideation in 2015 and was referred_

> _nil known asthma and allergic rhinitis”_

11     According to the Complainant, \[S\]’s condition worsened that night at the thought of having to meet the Respondent the next day. \[S\] was rushed to the hospital and was admitted in the early morning of 7 March 2019. The Complainant was informed by the hospital that the psychiatrist would see \[S\] and \[S\] would be in the hospital for a few days.

12     The Complainant then updated the Respondent about \[S\]’s admission. The Respondent turned up at the hospital during the day while the Complainant was at home. Sometime in the late afternoon, the Complainant received a call from the hospital informing her that they had to discharge \[S\] to the care of the Respondent. When the children were brought back to the Complainant’s home (the younger child was picked up by the Respondent from school while \[S\] was brought back from the hospital), the children were told by the Respondent to hand over to him their most prized Lego collections. The children thereafter confided to the Complainant that it was their punishment as \[S\] had visited a clinic and sought admission into hospital.

13     It was the Complainant’s further evidence that the next day, on 8 March 2019, \[S\] was afraid to go to school as she was fearful of having to meet the Respondent. The Respondent was due to have his overnight access to the children that weekend. After school, the children were forced to leave with the Respondent as the Respondent had insisted that the school comply with the access orders.

14     On 9 March 2019, the Respondent did not send the children back. Instead, the children were sent home by Mr. \[T\] and a female friend. The Complainant was surprised as this was the first time that the Respondent did not send the children home personally.

15     According to the Complainant, upon seeing her, the younger child expressed to her that “dad yelled and yelled so much and I cried the most today”. The children then related to her that the Respondent had threatened them to listen to him forever or that they would have “no daddy forever” (i.e. they would not get to see him anymore). The Respondent had also yelled at them and were throwing things around the house including hurling a metal coffee mug at the children’s direction. The Respondent then slammed his room door and shut himself inside the room. Mr. \[T\] later visited the Respondent’s residence and took the children out for a meal (without the Respondent) before returning them to the Complainant’s residence.

16     The Respondent denied the above allegations. Insofar as the medical documents were concerned, it was the Respondent’s position that the doctors did not know or could not have known the cause of \[S\]’s condition. In fact, the e-referral dated 6 March 2019 described the “visit diagnosis” as “ill-defined condition”. The Respondent also highlighted that the doctors were not called by the Complainant to give evidence at trial and he did not have the opportunity to cross-examine them. He also reiterated that the Complainant was not personally present at any of the alleged incidents.

17     It was the Respondent’s position that \[S\] was discharged by the hospital into his care without medication or medical certificate. In support of his position, the Respondent provided the NUH’s discharge summary dated 7 March 2019. The diagnosis was stated as “anxiety state” and the condition at discharge was described as “improved – condition better than at time of admission”.

18     As for the pick-up from school on 8 March 2019, it was the Respondent’s evidence that the school had released the children to him per the access orders. This was despite the presence of the Complainant’s friend, \[D\] who was there to pick up the children even though it was his access day. According to the Respondent, the school teachers and management had to intervene to stop \[D\] from picking up the children so that the children could return home with the Respondent.

19     As for the incident on 9 March 2019, while the Respondent acknowledged that he had refused to interact with the children as they had disobeyed him, the allegations of family violence were denied. The Respondent provided copies of apology letters written by the children as proof that the children had disobeyed him and they were apologising to him in these letters.

20     The Respondent’s witness, Mr. \[T\], also testified that on 7 March 2019, he had accompanied the Respondent to the hospital to visit \[S\]. Mr. \[T\] observed that \[S\] interacted normally with the Respondent, even though she had insisted that she did not want to leave with the Respondent. Similarly, he observed that the children were happy with the Respondent on 8 March 2019 when they accompanied the Respondent to a cell group meeting in which Mr. \[T\] was present. As for the incident on 9 March 2019, it was Mr. \[T\]’s evidence that the Respondent had informed him that the children were refusing to obey the Respondent. The Respondent sought Mr. \[T\]’s help to counsel the children and to send them home. According to Mr. \[T\], he arrived at the Respondent’s home in the late afternoon. The Respondent was in his bedroom and did not come out. Mr. \[T\] then took the children out for early dinner and sent them home. At all material times, the children did not complain to him about being shouted at by the Respondent. There was also no sign that the children had been harmed in any way.

##### (iii)    The incident of 26 April 2019

21     It was the Complainant’s evidence that on 26 April 2019, \[S\] came back from access and cried and complained that the Respondent had used a nail clipper to cut her wound.

22     The Respondent denied to having used a nail clipper to hurt \[S\]. According to the Respondent, \[S\] had an abscess infection on her thigh and he had gently squeezed the pus out with his hands and stopped when \[S\] told him that it hurt.

23     It was Mr. \[T\]’s testimony that on that day, he observed \[S\] to be having an abscess on her thigh. He noticed that there was bleeding through her plaster. \[S\] told him that she had asked the Respondent to help her clean and dress the wound as the Complainant did not send her to the doctor.

##### (iv)    Matters raised in the police report dated 27 May 2019

24     We now turn to the matters raised in the police report dated 27 May 2019. In the abovementioned police report, it was \[S\]’ statement to the police that since March 2018, she was threatened that if the children did not comply with the access timings, their mother (i.e. the Complainant) would go to jail. She also complained that on 10 May 2019 and 15 May 2019, the Respondent was in school for his access. The children wanted to return to the Complainant’s house but they were not allowed to. Instead, they were made to sit in school for two hours to spend time with the Respondent. When they told the Respondent that they were hungry, they were told that they would “starve together”.

25     The Respondent denied that there was family violence. The Respondent claimed that the Complainant was obstructing his access as the Complainant was in school to pick up the children on most of his access days in April and May 2019. To this, the Complainant responded that she had to be in school on these days as the children did not want to be in school. She had to make a promise to the children that she would be in school in order to persuade them to go to school.

26     It was Mr. \[T\]’s evidence that he had accompanied the Respondent to the children’s school on 15 May 2019. The Complainant was present in school. According to Mr. \[T\], the children had refused to leave with the Respondent as they kept insisting that the Respondent had abused them on 9 March 2019 and 26 April 2019, which according to Mr. \[T\], was a false depiction of what actually transpired on these days.

## My decision

27     I now explain the reasons for my decision.

28     In order for the court to grant a PPO, the court must be satisfied _on a balance of probabilities_ of two requirements. First, that family violence as defined by section 64 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353) has been committed or is likely to be committed by the Respondent on the children. Secondly, it is necessary for the protection of the children that a PPO be granted.

29     Under section 64, “family violence” is defined as the commission of any of the following acts:

> (a)     wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;

> (b)     causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have known would result in hurt;

> (c)     wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his will; or

> (d)     causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member;

but does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age.

30     At the outset, I acknowledge that this is not a straightforward matter. The allegations that have been raised by the Complainant are matters which have been shared with her by the two children who have not been called to give evidence in these proceedings. The court therefore did not have the benefit of the children’s direct testimony.

31     I further note that the allegations complained of relate to incidents that happened during the Respondent’s access time to the children. As such, it would have been convenient for this court to categorise the matters complained of as ‘access issues’ that are to be resolved in the appropriate forum. However, it has to be borne in mind that the issues of access and family violence are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Even though access is a common theme in these PPO proceedings, the court must look at whether the requirements for a PPO have been satisfied and if they have been satisfied, a PPO ought to be granted (if it is found to be necessary for the protection of the children).

32     In this particular case, I find that the balance of probabilities, in determining whether family violence has been committed or is likely to be committed by the Respondent on the children, leans towards the Complainant. Even though the children were not called to give testimony, there are independent contemporaneous documents, which support the Complainant’s contentions. The Respondent has raised objections on these documents on the basis that the doctors or the makers of these documents have not been called to give evidence. However, whether a document is admissible, in the absence of its maker being called to give evidence, would depend on the nature of the evidence that is being relied on. I am of the view that the Complainant is entitled to rely on these documents to show that there had been such visits and these documents were issued pursuant to such visits. It is noted that the Respondent himself relied on the NUH’s discharge summary dated 7 March 2019. In addition, the Respondent did not attempt to subpoena the makers of these documents to cross-examine them on the circumstances leading to the issuance of these documents and the contents of these documents.

33     Taking the evidence in totality, save for the alleged incident of 26 April 2019, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that family violence within the definition of section 64 of the Women’s Charter was committed by the Respondent on the two children in the other incidents complained of, in that, the Respondent has placed the children in fear of hurt and has caused continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to the children. As for the alleged incident of 26 April 2019, I am not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that family violence was committed. It is clear to me, in the course of the present proceedings, that the issue of access constitutes a source of major frustration for the Respondent and such frustrations have translated into reactions towards the children, which have adversely affected them. As such, I am of the view that a PPO is necessary, not just to protect the children, but also to restrain the Respondent from committing further acts of family violence on the children, even though these acts may not translate into actual, physical hurt. I am accordingly granting a PPO for the two children.

34     Finally, I would comment that even though under the existing access orders, the Respondent has the right to have access to the children after school, the manner of enforcing such access and the impact on the children are relevant to the court’s determination in these proceedings. This is not to say that that the Respondent is not entitled to the access that has been granted to him under the court orders. However, if in the course of enforcing access, it is effected in a manner that the children are continually harassed with the knowledge that the manner will cause anguish to the children, the court must intervene. Needless to say, if there has indeed been a breach, the Respondent is entitled to enforce his access orders in the appropriate forum. It is hoped that with the present PPO, access between the Respondent and the children can be carried out in a more meaningful manner.
