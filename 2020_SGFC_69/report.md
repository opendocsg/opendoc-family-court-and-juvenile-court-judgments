Matrimonial law – Women’s Charter – Ancillary issues – Division of assets – Maintenance of former wife

16 July 2020

### District Judge Sheik Mustafa:

## Introduction

1       The Wife and the Husband (the Plaintiff and Defendant respectively) of this case were divorced from each other by virtue of an interim judgment on 19 April 2018. This was by consent of the two of them. They also agreed to an order that they share joint custody of their two children (aged 13 and 19); that the Husband is to have care and control of them; and that the Wife is to have liberal access. They also agreed to an order that the Husband shall solely maintain the children. They had been married for 20½ years.

2       The parties could not come to an agreement on other ancillary matters, which are concerning the issue of division of assets and about maintenance of the Wife. After hearing the counsel’s arguments on these ancillary issues, I made orders on the division of assets and of maintenance for the Wife.

3       The Wife appealed, and the appeal was heard by the learned Justice Debbie Ong. Her Honour found that there was a need for the order to be clarified, and the case was sent back to me to clarify the terms of the judgment, with leave for parties to file submissions if necessary.

4       Accordingly, I saw learned counsel again at a clarification hearing. I directed for affidavits to be filed for an update, and for any written submissions to be filed as well.

5       I consequently issued a clarified order as follows–

> 1.    The Wife shall transfer all her rights interest and share in a property (which is referred to in these Grounds as “the condominium”) to the Husband upon the Husband’s refund of the Wife’s CPF contributions to it, with accrued interest thereon. The Husband shall bear all expenses related to the transfer. The transfer shall take place within 6 months of the date of the final judgement to be issued herein.

> 2.    The Husband shall transfer all his rights interest and share in another property (which is referred to in these Grounds as “the Hougang flat”) to the Wife upon the Wife’s partial refund of $63,000.00 the Husband’s CPF contributions to it. The Wife shall bear all expenses related to the transfer. The transfer shall take place within 6 months of the date of the final judgement to be issued herein.

> 3.    Each party shall be absolutely and solely entitled to all other assets that are already in their own respective names.

> 4.    The Husband is not liable for maintenance of the Wife.

> 5.    No order as to costs.

6       This time, the Husband appeals against my order relating to the transfer of the Hougang flat.

7       The following are the reasons for my judgment.

## The Matrimonial Assets

8       There are two immovable properties jointly owned by both the parties. Both the properties were acquired during the course of the marriage.

9       There is a condominium. Parties agree that its value is $1,120,000. The Husband and children reside there. There is an outstanding mortgage of $603,900 on this property. This leaves its net value to be $516,100.

10     There is an HDB flat at Hougang. Parties agree that the value is $450,000. There is no outstanding mortgage on this property.

11     The total matrimonial asset pool comprises of the following –

## Applicable principles on division of assets

12     As a start to my inquiry into dealing with the assets, I refer to section 112 of the Women’s Charter –

> **112**.    (1) The court shall have power, when granting or subsequent to the grant of a judgment of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage, to order the division between the parties of any matrimonial asset or the sale of any such asset and the division between the parties of the proceeds of the sale of any such asset in such proportions as the court thinks just and equitable.

> (2)    It shall be the duty of the court in deciding whether to exercise its powers under subsection (1) and, if so, in what manner, to have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the following matters:

>> (a)    the extent of the contributions made by each party in money, property or work towards acquiring, improving or maintaining the matrimonial assets;

>> (b)    any debt owing or obligation incurred or undertaken by either party for their joint benefit or for the benefit of any child of the marriage;

>> (c)    the needs of the children (if any) of the marriage;

>> (d)    the extent of the contributions made by each party to the welfare of the family, including looking after the home or caring for the family or any aged or infirm relative or dependant of either party;

>> (e)    any agreement between the parties with respect to the ownership and division of the matrimonial assets made in contemplation of divorce;

>> (f)    any period of rent-free occupation or other benefit enjoyed by one party in the matrimonial home to the exclusion of the other party;

>> (g)    the giving of assistance or support by one party to the other party (whether or not of a material kind), including the giving of assistance or support which aids the other party in the carrying on of his or her occupation or business; and

>> (h)    the matters referred to in section 114(1) so far as they are relevant. These are –

>>> (a)    the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;

>>> (b)    the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;

>>> (c)    the standard of living enjoyed by the family before the breakdown of the marriage;

>>> (d)    the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage;

>>> (e)    any physical or mental disability of either of the parties to the marriage;

>>> (f)    the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family; and

>>> (g)    in the case of proceedings for divorce or nullity of marriage, the value to either of the parties to the marriage of any benefit (for example, a pension) which, by reason of the dissolution or annulment of the marriage that party will lose the chance of acquiring.

13     The Court of Appeal in the case of _ANJ V ANK_[^1] outlined the approach in division of matrimonial assets. Accordingly, the task at hand for me is to derive a ratio which represents the parties’ respective direct contributions towards the acquisition or improvement of matrimonial assets. Next, is to derive a second ratio, which represents the parties’ indirect financial and non-financial contributions towards the welfare of the family. I should then average the two ratios to derive each party’s overall contribution to the family. The “average percentage contribution” or “average ratio” are non-binding figures, and I would have to make adjustments as and when necessary. I bore these in mind, as well as that adjustments might also be necessary whenever the parties’ collective direct contribution do not carry the same weight as that of the parties’ collective indirect contribution.

14     Division of matrimonial assets is not an exact science, but neither is it an indefinable art. It is not mandatory for the court to exercise its power of division in every single asset of the parties before it as long as it did not detract for the court’s overall mandate to achieve a just and equitable division in the light of all of the circumstances of the case[^2].

## Application of the law to the facts

##### Direct contributions

15     There are numerous points of factual dispute on the direct contributions of each party, and this is reasonably expected in a marriage as long as the present one, of 21years.

16     The parties acquired the Hougang flat using their CPF. This is not in dispute-

>   
| 

a.

 | 

Wife’s CPF payments to Hougang flat

 | 

$149,436,

 |
| 

b.

 | 

Husband’s CPF payments to Hougang flat

 | 

$272,043.

 |

  
  

17     There is a dispute on the facts about the parties’ contributions to the condominium. From their CPF accounts, the Wife contributed $240 and the Husband $141,908 to its acquisition. The Wife claims that she paid as follows–

> a.     $240 from her CPF,

> b.     $22,628.00 for stamp duty,

> c.     $140,105.00 for down payment, and

> d.     $20,000.00 for furniture and fittings.

18     The Husband claims that he paid as follows –

> a.     $141,908 from his CPF,

> b.     $46,701.80 being booking fee,

> c.     $30,000 for stamp fee and down payment, and

> d.     $50,614 for mortgage instalments.

19     In addition, there were payments towards the condominium totalling $132,732 from money collected from renting the Hougang flat.

20     Based on the evidence adduced, I find as follows -

> a.     Both parties made the respective payments from their CPF accounts of $240 by the Wife and $141,908 by the Husband,

> b.     There was a booking fee of $46,701.80 that was paid by the Wife,

> c.     There were stamp fees and down payment of $430,000 paid by the Husband,

> d.     There were mortgage instalments of $50,614 paid by the Husband,

> e.     The payments from the rent of the Hougang flat ought to be allocated equally between them at $66,636 each.

21     A summary of each party’s direct contributions to the two jointly acquired properties is as follows.

22     As can be seen above, the direct contributions made by the parties is 31.9 : 68.1 in terms of the first ratio prescribed by _ANJ V ANK._

##### Indirect contributions

23     The second ratio prescribed by _ANJ V ANK_ is that of the indirect financial and non-financial contributions towards the welfare of the family.

24     Both parties laid contradictory versions of each other in this regard. What is clear, however, is that this is a moderately long marriage, in which both parties played parental and household roles of varying degrees and form at different stages of their marital and parental journey. They were both working parents. They both attended to the children.

25     I applied a broad brush approach to the issue. The totality of the evidence shows that there was no significant imbalance in non-financial contributions to the household.

26     I therefore find the second ratio prescribed by _ANJ V_ ANK to be 50:50.

##### Average ratio and result

27     Thirdly, as prescribed by _ANJ V ANK_, I then averaged the two ratios to derive each party’s overall contribution to the family. I find that in the overall circumstances of the case, the direct and indirect contributions have equal weight of 50:50. I find thus because there is no substantial imbalance between the parties’ direct and indirect contributions that calls for the two to be accorded different weightage.

## Conclusion on division of assets

28     First, I allocated the assets in sole names between the parties –

29     The combined net value of the two properties is $966,100. In order to realise the parties’ respective shares, I ordered the Husband to retain the condominium since he is already residing there with the children. He will have to refund to the Wife her CPF contribution of $240, with interest.

30     I ordered the Wife to retain the Hougang flat worth $450,000. There remains a difference of $62,466. This is resolved if she makes a partial refund to the Husband’s CPF contributions of that amount.

31     With the CPF refund of $62,466 00 from the Wife, the Husband will then realise his share of $894,223. The end result will be as follows –

32     I rounded off the figure of the CPF refund to the Husband by the Wife to $63,000.

33     I was satisfied that this division of the matrimonial assets is just and fair, not only for the reasons above, but also taking into account that the children of the marriage will continue to reside with the Husband after the divorce. On the other hand, the Wife will be living by herself. A larger share of the assets granted to the Husband will enable not only him, but the children of the parties as well, to afford accommodation for themselves. This is a relevant consideration under s112(2)(c) of the Women’s Charter -

> **112**.    (2) It shall be the duty of the court in deciding whether to exercise its powers under subsection (1) and, if so, in what manner, to have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the following matters: …

>> (c)    the needs of the children (if any) of the marriage.

## Clarification proceedings

34     At the clarification proceedings, I requested parties to update the information regarding the assets. In coming to my decision hereinabove, I did not take into account the information after all. This is because the value of the assets to be considered must be taken as at the time of the hearing of the issue of the division of the assets, and that was as at the date of the first hearing of the case. The clarification hearing is thus not the correct forum for determining or re-determining, the value of the asset pool.

35     In addition, learned counsel made submissions from the clarification hearing. Inter alia, it was submitted that I had erred in my first finding regarding the Wife’s contributions to the Hougang flat. In this regard, I do not make a comment. My findings of fact were made at the substantive hearing previously. I am of the view that it would not be appropriate for me to re-visit my findings of fact at a clarification hearing. The issue of whether any finding of fact I made is correct or not is a matter to be decided by the appellate tribunal.
