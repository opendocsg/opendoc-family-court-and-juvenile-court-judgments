Division of Matrimonial Assets

1 April 2019

### District Judge Daniel Koh:

## A.   INTRODUCTION

1       Every family is different, so every divorcing couples and their families. In this case, the Plaintiff Husband said that he wished for his Defendant Wife to be back with him and the family. He was willing to forgive her for straying. She however declined to return to the marriage. Perhaps, it was because the offer of the Husband only recognised one part of the problem in the marriage. According to her lawyer she was still psychologically affected by the breakdown in the marriage and has her reasons to spurn the Husband’s offer.

2       The couple have 2 teenage boys aged 15 and 13 respectively in their 18 years of marriage. They were married on xxx 2000. The marriage started unravelling in 2016 upon which the Husband’s filed the first divorce proceeding which he subsequently withdrew. Husband filed this second divorce proceeding in 2017.

3       Husband is a 50 years old business manager with an established accounting firm. Wife is 44 years old, the personal assistant of a corporation. Whilst she earned about $5,000 a month, he earned a monthly range of $27,00 to $28,000 over the period of 2015 to 2017.

4       Interim judgement was entered on 21 February 2018 on the ground of the Wife’s unreasonable behaviour. Parties entered consent order on issues relating to the children and maintenance. But the bitterness of the divorce did not stop there. Dispute arose on issues of division of matrimonial assets.

5       To the credit of both counsel, at the ancillary hearing, parties were able to narrow down the issues further to agree that the total matrimonial assets pool was $2,434,710.60. Based on the structured approach in ANJ v ANK \[2015\] SGCA 334 (ANJ), parties resolved that the direct contributions of each parties were 66:34 in favour of the Husband.

6       What remained to be decided was the contributions of Husband and Wife in the aspects of their indirect contributions over the course of 18 years of marriage.

7       After going through the evidence adduced before me, I ordered that the indirect contributions of the parties be in the proportion of 58:42 in the Wife’s favour. As the marriage was reasonably long, I gave equal weightage to both the parties’ direct and indirect contributions such that the final percentage for the distribution of matrimonial assets worked out to be 54:46 in the Husband’s favour.

8       The Husband was dissatisfied and appealed against the above order.

## B.   Applicable law

9       The law on division of matrimonial assets is clear. Section 112(1) of the Women’s Charter (the Act), confers a broad discretion on the court. S112(2) of the Act enumerates a list of non-exhaustive factors to assist the court to divide the matrimonial assets ‘in such proportions as the court thinks just and equitable’ and having ‘regard to all the circumstances of the case’.

10     Against this legislative backdrop, it bears highlighting that the wide discretion of the court is guided by an important principle: the division of matrimonial assets is grounded on the philosophy of marriage being an ‘equal cooperative partnership of efforts’, without discrimination as to whether the spousal contributions are in the economic or home-making spheres. (see NK V NL at \[20\] per Andrew Phang JA). To ensure that each party’s contributions to the marriage are given due recognition, the Court of Appeal in TNL v TNK (TNL) upheld the applicability of three broad steps enunciated in ANJ for double income marriages, where both parties are working and therefor able to make both direct and indirect financial contributions to the household.

11     Following the decision in TNL’s case, the Judicial Commissioner Debbie Ong (as she then was) further observed in the High Court decision in UBM v UBN at \[66\]: that the trends in cases of long marriages with children, whether single income or dual income, incline towards equal division. Her Honour went on to add:

_“67_      _These trends and observations are valuable guides for the court tasked with examining all the circumstances of each unique case to reach a fair outcome. They do not shackle the court’s discretion, for there is no norm or presumptive division proportion, but are aides to guide it towards a just and equitable division of assets. They remain relevant even when applying the structured step-by –step approach in ANJ v ANK. As I have explained earlier, the court ought to be mindful of the trends in precedent cases particularly when it considers the average ratio to reach the final one._

_68_      _At the end of the day, it must not be forgotten that the spirit of the decision in TNL v TNK is to recognise that the outcome of the division ought not be undermine the fundamental nature of marriage as an equal partnership and that the structured approach ought not to be applied as a hard and fast rule. Instead, the structured approach in ANJ v ANK, when used in a manner that does not limit the scope of broad brush adjustments, gives helpful guidance to the court in upholding the philosophy of marriage and in giving equal and sufficient recognition to both the breadwinning and homemaking.”_

## Parties’ indirect contributions

12     The Husband’s evidence regarding his indirect financial and non-financial contributions were as followed. He highlighted that in the course of their marriage, he bought the Wife various luxurious gifts of Rolex watch, branded handbags and spent money for her cosmetic surgery to have double eye lids. Because of his superior earning capacity compared to that of his Wife, he undertook the entire burden of the indirect financial contribution towards household expenses. The Wife only started contributing to the utilities and expendables when the Husband and the children moved out of the matrimonial flat in 2016.

13     In relation to the indirect non-financial contributions, he was actively engaged with the boys throughout the marriage at each stage of the children’s lives. Apart from that he saw to the Wife’s mental health issues and also provided rent free stay to her parents when they moved into the matrimonial flat in 2016. He denied that the Wife was both a dutiful wife and mother. Sometime in 2015, because of other distractions, she was not interested in the marriage and was neglectful of the children. He was left alone with the responsibility of caring for the children. According to him, this explained why the children chose to move out of the matrimonial home with him rather than to stay with the Wife. He said that he was unclear what exactly was the Wife relying on as her indirect non-financial contributions, except for the fact that she gave birth to the 2 children and breastfed them in the 2 years that she stopped working. The Wife portrayal of herself as a victim of an unhappy marriage was not consistent to her conscious decision to remain in the marriage enjoying the trappings of luxury and comfort that he had provided. The fact was she had less stressful job, and yet she delegated the homemaking role to the domestic helper.

14     The Husband submitted the following table to indicate the percentages of the respective parties’ contributions.

In summary, he sought a court order to apportion the indirect contributions in the ratio of 65:35 in his favour.

15     The Wife’s evidence was that from the beginning of the marriage, parties shared a joint account to pay for all household expenses. Every month both of them would contribute $1500 each into the joint account; regardless of the fact that the Husband’s income was all the while significantly higher than hers. The Husband was always evasive about his salary increments and bonuses when asked. But he would insist that expenses be split right down the middle for all outgoings. There were occasions however when she had to use her savings to cover the children’s expenses because the Husband did not contribute enough.

16     In xxx 2003 after the birth of the 1st son, she quitted her job to be a fulltime housewife. The Husband promised her that he would support the family financially given his substantial income. She had no domestic helper until the second child was born, and she struggled to cope with the housework and looking after the children. The Husband was busy with work and building his career. He was seldom around and was never good with the children when they were younger. She took care of the children, tutored them when they were older, saw to their well-being and educational needs. She bought them numerous toys, enrichment books, brought them out to the playground and shopping malls and to the clinic whenever they were not well. She devoted her time to manage the family so that the Husband could focus on his career. Over time however, the Husband’s behaviour towards her changed. She was restricted and repressed by his controlling behaviour and was also a victim of his sexual fantasy. The Husband’s addiction to hard core pornography brought out the worst in him. She alleged that he dictated to her what her appearance and dressing ought to be like, and guilt-tripped her into posing for nude photos for him. He even enjoyed having other men ogled at her.

17     In 2005 as she could no longer stay at home alone, she decided to return to the workforce so that she was able to gain some financial independence. Although she graduated with a university degree, the Husband even controlled the line of work that she was allowed to take up as he wanted her to be available to tend to the families’ needs should the circumstances require. The Husband made it clear that he needed to focus on his career so the Wife need to sacrifice hers to take care of the boys. She had put up with the Husband’s controlling behaviour for years. In 2009 she had a mental breakdown, in 2010 to salvage the marriage for the sake of the children parties attended counselling sessions. She has since struggled to recover from depression. At one point she was suicidal. Because of her mental fragility, in 2017 when the Husband moved out of the matrimonial home with the children, her parents had to move in to look after her. She alleged that she strayed from her duties as a spouse, only because of Husband’s controlling and manipulative behaviour towards her. She was an abused Wife for the last 17 years, she suffered mental abuses to the extent that she had been seeing several psychiatrists. She was diagnosed with insomnia, clinical depression and suffered from frequent anxiety attacks. Instead of seeking treatment for his pornography addiction, the Husband had aggravated her condition causing her to require higher dosage of medication. She alleged that the Husband had even manipulated the children into thinking that she cannot care for them and took them with him when he moved out of the matrimonial home.

18     In response, the Husband did not dispute the Wife’s mental illness. He regretted however that the Wife was trying to character assassinate him when these issues were irrelevant to the court’s present inquiry in the dispute on distribution of matrimonial assets. While he conceded that he viewed pornography in the privacy of the marriage, he denied that his behaviour had led her mental ailments. He alleged that the Wife had raised these issues only to justify her affair and the restlessness in the marriage. He was not the cause of her Borderline Personality Disorder condition. He too suffered abuses at the hand of the Wife just that he bore these silently during the marriage. He claimed that the Wife’s depression was due to her feeling bored in the marriage and her indiscreet yearning to meet with men more charming and wealthier than him. He added too that the Wife’s parents are staying in the matrimonial home now because they had gambled away their flat and had no place to go rather than because of their concern for the Wife’s well-being.

## Quantifying Parties’ Indirect contributions

19     The ultimate objective here was to recognise each party’s contributions towards the marriage, to appropriately compensate the spouses’ indirect contributions in order to ensure a just and equitable distribution of the matrimonial assets. In a bitter breakdown in marital relationship, it can be expected that neither parties would be charitable with each other to give fair credit on the respective parties’ indirect contribution throughout the marriage. The court would have to approach the issue by exercising sound judgement, having regard to the inherent veracity of each parties’ version of the events reflected in their affidavits. The court needed to remain sensitive to the factual nuances of the case.

20     In the case of TNL, Judith Prakash JA had this to say on assessment of parties’ indirect contributions at \[47\]:

_‘Additionally, we take this opportunity to clarify that even when the ANJ approach_ _does_ _apply (ie, in Dual-Income Marriage cases), Step 2 should_ _not_ _be further broken down into two sub-steps such that separate ratios are assigned to indirect financial contributions, on the one hand, and non-financial contributions, on the other. Such an approach has no legal basis and is, furthermore, inconsistent with our observation in ANJ (at \[24\]) that:_

_In relation to indirect contributions, the problem with ascertaining the extent of the parties’ contributions with precision is further compounded._ _In the nature of things, for the Court to ascribe a ratio in respect of the non-financial or indirect financial contributions of the parties, the Court is clearly not indulging in any mathematical calculation because often there is very little concrete evidence to be relied upon_ _. Contributions in the form of parenting, homemaking and Husbandry, by their very nature, are incapable of being reduce into monetary terms. No mathematical formula or analytical tool is capable of capturing or accommodating the diverse and myriad set of factual scenarios that may present themselves to Court as to how the parties may have chosen to divide among themselves duties and responsibilities in the domestic sphere. It is in making this determination that what is known as the broad brush approach would have to come into play._ _What values to give to the indirect contributions of the parties is necessarily a matter of impression and judgment of the Court_ _. In most homes, even in a home where both the spouses are working full time, in the absence of concrete evidence it is more likely than not that ordinarily the Wife will be the party who renders greater indirect contributions. That said, even in a home where the Wife is a full-time homemaker, it would be an exceptional home where the Husband renders no indirect contribution at all._ _What values to attribute to each spouse in relation to indirect contributions would be a matter of assessment for the Court and in that regard broad strokes would have to be the order of the day_ _. In seeking to arrive at a ratio that represents both parties’ comparative indirect contribution towards the family, the Court must, in the final analysis, exercise sound discretion along with a keen emphasis on all the relevant facts of each case._

\[emphasis added\]

21     In this connection, I disregarded the Husband’s table giving his breakdown in percentages the indirect financial and the indirect non-financial contributions of the parties. The court was not expected to make an exact calculation of each spouse’s indirect financial or non-financial contributions. Rather, consistent with existing case law, the court was to proceed in this role in a ‘rough and ready approximation’ (see NK v NL at \[28\]), but was also logical and commonsensical with careful regard to all the facts and factors in the case at hand. An important factor to consider in the present case was this: that this was not a short and childless marriage. Both parties had invested much of their lives, energy and resources in the marital relationship, as well as nurturing the children and building up the home. But they were almost diametrically opposed on the indirect contributions ratio. The Husband submitted a ratio of 65:35 in his favour, while the Wife’s ratio was at 66:34 in her favour.

22     Counsel for the Husband urged me to place emphasis on his financial prowess in providing for the family, which I gave him credit for. I had no doubt that he worked hard and long hours, to achieve the material success so that he could provide the Wife and the children a reasonably high standard of lifestyle. But according to the Wife he was only able to focus on climbing the corporate ladder, and became successful in his career because he made it clear to her that she needed to sacrifice hers to take care of the boys and the needs of the family. She gave up her job as an assistant marketing manager at the start of the marriage when the children were born. She was a full time home-maker for about 2 years to care for and breastfed the children. For a while she was alone struggling to cope with the needs of the boys and the housework. She was able to return to the workforce in 2005 as the family engaged the services of a domestic helper but she continued to care for the children and did housework after working hours and during weekends. I saw no reason to doubt that the family made a decision to prioritise the Husband’s career. Both started as junior executive when they first got married, she was still earning about $5,000 per month as a personal assistant in a corporation to date. Clearly she had subordinated her interest and career to allow the husband to pursue his. There was nothing to show that she was not able to find a better job had she tried.

23     In their submissions to the court, both parties contended that the other had behaved badly. The Husband was upset over the Wife’s relationship with a third party. The Wife, on her part, raised in her reply contentions such as emotional abuse by the Husband. The Husband was controlling and manipulative, she felt isolated and her personal life choked. However, as was noted by the Court of Appeal in the case of Chan Tin Sun \[2015 SGCA 2\] at \[25\]: “the hearing of the ancillaries is not intended to be another forum for parties to dredge up accusations and allegations relating to each other’s conduct”. In this case, it was clear to the court that both the Husband and the Wife were hurting. But the court was not here to point out who was at fault. This was not because the court was disdainful of the agony and struggle of the breakup of the family unit; but what needed reminder here was this: parties in a breakdown of their marriage tended to be tainted by animosity and were pre-occupied with the question as to who has more right, when they should instead focus on what they could still seek to be right with each other, and in particular, to do that which is right by the children post-divorce. As was remarked by a learned writer: it is always easier to start a war and destroy than to heal and construct. The court can hope to heal, but only the parties themselves can help reconstruct. That said, I recognised that it could be challenging here as although the Husband (as was indicated earlier) was willing to reconnect with the Wife, it was apparent to me that despite her love for the children, she could not bring herself to trust the Husband at this moment to return to him.

24     From the arguments canvassed before me, the Husband’s advancement in his career was able to meet the financial needs of the family and comfortably. But I was persuaded that the burden of being a Wife and mother took a toll on the Defendant, emotionally and psychologically. In 2009, she suffered a mental breakdown. In 2010, parties attended counselling sessions and in 2016, Husband sought treatment for his pornography addiction. Counsel for the Wife submitted that she suffered mental distress in the marriage so much so that she had insomnia, clinical depression and anxiety. Every now and then, the Wife would suffer from frequent anxiety attacks. She was a patient with psychiatrists from xxx Hospital and the xxx the last few years, and was prescribed long-term anti-depressants, mood disorder and sleeping pills. The severity of her mental distress continued to date. I did not think that she was faking a victim’s role for the purpose of the divorce proceeding as the Husband had suggested.

25     I felt quite certainly that the Wife’s indirect contributions outweighed the Husband’s. She was the primary caregiver of the children until 2016, although the Husband did play his part: especially in the one year when the he was without job and when he moved out of the matrimonial home on 15 June 2017 to stay with his parents. In all the circumstance of the case, taking a broad brush approach, I felt that the parties’ indirect contributions relative to each other would fairly be represented by a ratio of 58:42 in favour of the Wife. This ratio was not overly generous to the Wife. I had resisted giving her a higher ratio, as courts tend to lean in favour of homemakers who have laboured to raise children to adulthood at the expense of their career, because in this case, the Husband was not an absent father but had also contributed to household responsibility. Although Husband would not concede that the Wife played any exceptional role in indirect contribution to the family over the 18 years of marriage, the fact is that in the course of this marriage, albeit not necessarily a marathon one, she shouldered different degree in burden of home-making, particularly given that she had stayed home to take care of the children while they were at their youngest and most demanding. She bore the brunt of being a wife and mother and took job that gave her flexible hours to allow her time for the family. This entailed sacrifice of potential for career development and it was easy to undervalue her indirect contributions here.

## The averge ratio

26     In considering the adjustment to be made to reach the final ratio, counsel for the Husband submitted that this was not an appropriate case to award 50% of the matrimonial assets; based on case law 20% to 30% of the assets was usually awarded for marriages 10 years or more involving cases of homemakers whose indirect contributions were substantial. In my judgment, there was no need to make adjustment to the average of the ratios. The marriage of about 18 years was relatively long. The matrimonial assets pool was not exceptionally large, both parties contributed collectively effort to build up the family’s assets pool. The direct contributions of the Husband were enabled only by the indirect contributions and sacrifice on the part of the Wife. Further the rent free occupation during the period of separation was a voluntary act on the part of the Husband and subsisted only for about a year. Because of the Wife’s fragile mental condition, the parents who themselves had health issues moved in to stay with her. In none of the cases cited, did the wife suffer prolonged mental breakdown.

27     Accordingly, I took the simple average of the two ratios above which, yielded an overall divisional ratio of 54:46 in favour of the Husband. The parties spent 18 years of their lives invested in the family, there were very unhappy moments but there were also I am sure good and happy moments. The Wife did look after the home and the children, if the court were to accept the indirect contribution ratio proposed by the Husband, and apply a weightage he advocated of 75% to 25% to the direct and indirect contributions respectively, the Husband will receive 80% and the Wife only 20% of the total matrimonial assets. This would be quite absurd and would not be a fair and equitable distribution in my view, weighing the roles of the parties over the 18 years of marriage with 2 children.

##### Conclusion

28     It was unfortunate that the children were made to take sides in the bitter breakdown of the marriage, but I hope that the court’s final ratio of 54:46 in favour of the Husband gave them appropriate dignity to their joint achievements together over the years to build their unique family, and that there should be some closure so the both parties can move on with their lives. In closing I must commend both the counsel for trying hard on their part to bring closure to the breakdown of relationships and the parties to move on. The misunderstanding and the hurts were deep. In a just and equitable distribution of matrimonial assets, the principle of law gleaned from the cases can be applied compassionately in a hurting family. It should not be viewed only from enforcement of legal rights and entitlements. Parties must not lose sight that apart from the children who are the legacies of the marriage, for which there are still much for the parties to do in co-parenting, in many cases they have history of loving relationship and were not strangers during the period of the marriage.

29     The final order made before me was as follows:

a.     That the defendant’s rights, interest and share in the matrimonial property known as and situated at XXX, shall be transferred to the plaintiff within three months from the date of certificate of making interim judgement final upon the plaintiff making payment of a sum representing 46% of the total asset value less the value of assets in defendant’s name ($442,369.67), calculated at $677,596.93 and taking over the outstanding loan of the property. The defendant shall refund any amount due to her CPF used in the purchase of the property with accrued interest. The plaintiff is to bear the costs and expenses of the transfer.

b.     In event of no transfer, the matrimonial property is to be sold in the open market and the net sale proceeds after the repayment of the outstanding expenses shall be divided in the proportion of 54% to the plaintiff and 46% to the defendant after taking into account the total asset value of the marriage agreed at $2,434,710.60.

c.     In the event of a sale of the property, both parties shall refund the amounts due to their CPF accounts for use in the purchase of the property with accrued interest from their respective shares in the sale proceeds of the matrimonial property.

d.     The defendant shall transfer her interest in the vehicle registration number SDH636B to the plaintiff wholly and without consideration upon his taking over the hire-purchase of the same.

e.     This order is made subject to the Central Provident Fund Act (Cap.36) and the subsidiary legislation made in respect of the Member’s CPF moneys, property and investments. The Board shall give effect to the terms of this order in accordance with the provisions of the CPF Act and the subsidiary legislation made thereunder.

f.     The Registrar or Deputy Registrar of the Family Justice Courts under section 31 of the Family Justice Act is empowered to execute, sign or indorse all necessary documents relating to matters contained in this order on behalf of the either party should either party fail to do so within (7) days of written request being made to the party.

g.     That each party shall retain his or her own other assets that are in their respective sole names.
