Family Law – personal protection order – s65, Women’s Charter

1 December 2020

### District Judge Suzanne Chin:

## Introduction

1       The parties who had previously been married, came before me after having filed cross applications for personal protection orders (”PPO’s”). The ex-wife (“Wife”) applied for a PPO to restrain the ex-husband (“Husband”) from committing family violence against her and the 2 children of the marriage while the Husband filed an application for a PPO to restrain the Wife from committing family violence against him and the 2 children of the marriage.

2       At the start of the trial, both parties requested for leave to withdraw their applications in relation to the children and I granted to both parties leave to withdraw the PPO applications in relation to the children. After hearing from parties on their applications for PPO’s against each other, I granted a PPO to the Wife to restrain the Husband from committing family violence against her but dismissed the Husband’s application.

3       The Husband has filed an appeal in SS 797/2020, the Wife’s application for a PPO against him but has not filed an appeal in SS xx/2020, his application for a PPO against the Wife, which I dismissed. Notwithstanding, as both applications related to some overlapping incidents, I will in these grounds of decision, give reasons for my decision in both the Husband’s and the Wife’s applications.

## Background

4       At the time of the hearing, the Husband was 36 years of age while the Wife was 28 years old. The parties were divorced with Interim Judgement having been granted on 20 February 2018.

5       Ancillary Orders were made by consent on 28 November 2018 and parties agreed that the Wife would have sole care and control of the children with access as detailed in the order being granted to the Husband. Even though parties were living separately, they continued to experience considerable difficulty with access arrangements for the children and acrimony appears to have continued.

## The Law

6       Under section 65 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353), a PPO may be issued if the court finds on a balance of probabilities that (a) family violence has been committed or is likely to be committed against a family member; and (b) it is necessary for the protection of that family member.

7       Section 64 defines “family violence” to mean the commission of any of the following acts:

> (a)    wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;

> (b)    causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;

> (c)    wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his will; or

> (d)    causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member.

## Incidents of alleged violence

8       The Wife’s PPO application was based on 3 incidents. These had occurred on each of the 26 April 2020, 20 October 2018 and 16 March 2017.

9       The Husband’s PPO application was based on 2 incidents: (a) the incident on 26 April 2020 and (b) an incident on 23 April 2020.

10     As the incident of 26 April 2020 was commonly relied upon by both parties, I shall deal with this incident considering each parties’ position and whether family violence had been committed by each of them against the other before proceeding to consider the other incidents of violence relied upon by each party in their application.

## Whether Family Violence had been committed

### Incident on 26 April 2020

#### The Wife’s account of the incident

11     According to the Wife, the Husband had unexpectedly turned up at her residence without prior notice at about 7pm that evening and had demanded to see the children. He insisted on seeing the children even though according to her, it was not his usual access time. Notwithstanding that it was late and the children were having their dinner, the Wife decided to allow him into her house. A quarrel ensued and the Wife contended that the Husband started scolding her with vulgarities. As things began to escalate, the Wife announced that she was going to call the police unless the Husband left. According to her, as he refused to leave her house, she ran into her bedroom to pick up her house phone with the intention of calling the police. The Husband followed her into her bedroom, continuing to shout at her. She then ran out of the bedroom with the phone in hand towards the kitchen and the Husband chased after her. While she was in the middle of calling the police, the Wife claimed that the Husband grabbed onto her arms and tried to snatch the phone away. He then grabbed onto her neck and pulled on her hair pushing her onto the floor causing her to land on the right side of the body. He then pushed her head onto the floor twice.

12     It was her position that while she was lying on the floor, the Husband took the younger child and left. The Wife then called the police for a 2nd time to tell them that the Husband had taken the child away and shortly thereafter, the police arrived. Upon arrival, they apparently saw her injuries, called the ambulance and advised her to go to the hospital. While she did not go to the hospital immediately as she was concerned about the whereabouts of her younger child, she eventually went to the hospital that evening to treat her injuries after the Husband had brought the younger child back to her home.

### The Husband’s account of the incident

13     The Husband gave evidence claiming that the Wife had refused to respond to his messages that morning and as it was his access day, he went to her home on the day and took the younger child out of the home. He maintained that while he was taking the child, the Wife pushed him and grabbed his neck with her right hand as she tried to prevent him from taking the child with him. He then pushed her off and left. As a result of the incident, according to him, he had 2 fingernail marks on his neck.

### Whether Family Violence had been inflicted by the Husband on the Wife

14     In support of her position, the Wife tendered copies of her hospital discharge summary, photographs of injuries sustained as well as a police case card[^1]. Upon examination of the evidence before me, I noted that these appeared largely consistent with her account of the incident. The Husband argued that the discharge summary was largely based on what the Wife would have told the doctor. I did not agree with this entirely. While I agreed that the statement written by the attending doctor “assaulted by ex-husband tonight” would have come from the Wife, I did not agree that the details noted under the “discharge diagnosis” section of the summary would not have been independently arrived at by the diagnosing doctor. This together with the photographs tendered by the Wife[^2], led me to conclude that the Wife had shown on the balance of probabilities that the Husband had committed family violence against her on 26 April 2020.

### Whether Family Violence had been inflicted by the Wife on the Husband

15     In support of his contentions on the events that transpired on 26 April 2020, the Husband had stated on the stand that he had taken photos of the injuries he had sustained as a result of the Wife’s actions that evening but had not gone to see a doctor as he had not wanted to make a big deal out of it[^3]. He also contended that he had filed a police report on the incident and had been provided with the police case card[^4] issued to him by the relevant investigation officer. He also referred to the “collective report” which he had filed to the police on 7 July 2020.

16     Upon examination of the Husband’s evidence, I noted firstly, that the Husband had tendered numerous documents to court, many of which were irrelevant to the current PPO applications. The Husband also tendered an affidavit entitled “Complainant’s Affidavit PPO” for these PPO applications as well as various other applications he had made. While this affidavit was not signed[^5], as it appeared to have been tendered by the Husband as his evidence in this PPO trial, I considered the contents of this very carefully. In this affidavit, while the Husband refers to the incident which occurred on 26 April 2020[^6], I note that nowhere does he refer to the Wife pushing him nor grabbing his neck. I also note that no photographs of the “fingernail marks on his neck” were tendered.

17     In support of his claim, the Husband informed the court that he had filed a police report on the incident. When asked where this police report could be found in his evidence, the Husband referred to a case card that the investigating officer had apparently issued to him[^7]. Upon closer examination I found this to be identical to the case card referred to by the Wife in her evidence[^8]. As it was unclear what this case card related to and as I did not have sight of the actual police report that the Husband claimed he had filed, I did not find this piece of evidence provided much support of the Husband's contentions.

18     The Husband also referred to a “collective report” which he had filed on 7 July 2020 and had maintained that he had referred to the incident of 26 April 2020 in this report[^9]. I have gone through that report in detail and unfortunately am not able to find any reference made in the report to the incident of 26 April 2020.

19     Taking all of this into consideration, and also noting that the Husband appeared to have been very economical with the details of the incident notwithstanding the court’s repeated and specific requests, I arrived at the conclusion that the Husband had not proven on the balance of probabilities that the Wife had inflicted family violence on him on the 26 April 2020.

### Incidents on 20 October 2018 and 16 March 2017 in the Wife’s application

20     The Wife also relied on 2 other incidents in her application for a PPO against the Husband. The first took place on 20 October 2018 after the parties attended the elder child’s graduation ceremony. By that stage, parties were already divorced. According to the Wife, when she left the ceremony with the child, the Husband followed her and as she got into the Grab car which she had ordered, he held onto the door and refused to let her leave. According to her, he then pinched and scratched her left thigh. The Wife tendered copies of photographs, a medical report as well as a police report[^10]. She also informed the court that she had applied for a PPO on 23 October 2018 following this but had eventually withdrawn this as she wanted to give him a chance at the time. The Husband denied that this incident had occurred but did not provide any version of his own.

21     Upon examination of the evidence before me as well as the parties’ submissions, I found that the Wife had proven on a balance of probabilities that the Husband had committed family violence on her on 20 October 2018.

22     The Wife also referred to an incident on 16 March 2017. She claimed that she had been six (6) months pregnant at the time and the Husband had continuously sent her text messages threatening to take the children away and constantly harassing her. When asked by the court what evidence she had of all of this, she admitted that she had not included any of this into her evidence. Without detail and only with a general bare assertion, I did not accept the Wife’s evidence and reached the conclusion that no family violence had occurred on 16 March 2017.

### Incident on 23 April 2020 in the Husband’s application

23     The Husband contended on the stand that on 23 April 2020, during COVID, the Wife wanted to take his access rights away and said to him that if he came anywhere close to her home, she would find a way to threaten him and expose him. He said “I’m, actually, to be honest, very afraid of the fact that Ms. \[N\] is able to do this again.”[^11] When asked what he was referring to, he referred to earlier incidents where she had posted on social media in 2017 making allegations of his having abused her. In this regard, he also maintained that she had previously written to him on his company email address and had copied his head of department. While the Wife denied ever having done this, it was clear from the evidence provided and I accepted that she had on the occasion of 9 July 2017, made threats to “ruin” the Husband and had carried them out by posting on Facebook he had abused her[^12].

24     The Husband’s case however was that the Wife had on 23 April 2020 threatened him and he was afraid that she would repeat her actions of 9 April 2017. While the Husband referred to this 23 April 2020 incident on the stand, I note that this was not referred to in either of his complaint form or in his affidavit for his PPO and other than this bare assertion, he had provided no other evidence to support this contention. In light of this, I did not find the Husband’s version of events believable and was unable to accept his bare assertion. Accordingly, I did not find that he had proven on the balance of probabilities that the Wife had committed Family Violence on him on 23 April 2020.

### Was it necessary for a PPO to be granted?

#### For the Wife

25     As I had made a finding that family violence had been inflicted by the Husband against the Wife, I proceeded to consider if it was necessary for a PPO to be granted for the protection of the Wife.

26     The parties were divorced and all ancillary matters have been supposedly finalised for more than 2 years. Notwithstanding, parties still appear to be embroiled in acrimonious disputes in relation to child issues and in light of this, I am of the view that a PPO is necessary for the protection of the Wife.

#### For the Husband

27     I had not made any finding of family violence having been committed by the Wife against the Husband in either of the 26 April 2020 or 23 April 2020 incident. I turned however to considering if it would be likely given the circumstances that family violence might be committed by the Wife against the Husband going forward. While I did make a finding that the Wife had made a post on facebook on 9 July 2017, this appeared to have been a one-off incident which did not amount to “causing continual harassment”. I also noted that this incident took place some 3 years ago and the Husband had not raised any other recent incidents apart from the purported incident on the 23 April 2020 where I had determined that the Husband had not discharged the requisite burden of prove to establish that that family violence had in fact occurred. In light of this, I came to the conclusion that it was unlikely that family violence would be committed by the Wife against the Husband going forward and I did not consider that it would be necessary for a PPO to be granted for the protection of the Husband. Accordingly I dismissed his application for a PPO.

## Conclusion

28     Having considered all of the evidence and submissions before me, I granted the Wife’s application but dismissed the Husband’s application. Based on my assessment of the relationship of the parties, I determined that it would be beneficial to both of them to receive counselling and accordingly ordered that they both attend the relevant counselling.
