Family Law – Family Violence – Orders for Protection

26 February 2021

### District Judge Nicole Loh:

1       This is an application for a personal protection order (“PPO”) filed by a brother (“Brother”) against his sister (“Sister”), both of whom are adults.

## Background

2       The siblings in this case used to live together with their Mother. In 2018, an altercation occurred between the siblings, leading to the Sister applying for and obtaining a PPO against the Brother. Subsequently, the Brother moved out and lived separately from the Sister and their Mother. However, the Brother alleges despite the physical separation, the Sister’s subsequent conduct leaves him with no choice but to apply for a PPO against the Sister.

3       After hearing both parties, I granted a PPO in favour of the Brother against the Sister. The Sister has filed an appeal against the PPO granted.

## Facts

4       The following are undisputed facts:

> (a)     On 28 April 2018, a dispute occurred between the siblings. They were living at the same residence then. The Sister poured bath gel on the Brother. The Brother pushed the Sister away, the Sister retaliated by slapping him.

> (b)     In September 2019, the Brother married his wife, a foreigner. The Sister was not supportive of his marriage and sent many messages to him in the months leading up to his marriage voicing her disapproval.

> (c)     On 18 May 2020, the Brother visited at the Sister’s residence to pass some items for their Mother’s use. An argument ensued and the Sister later sent the Brother a message _“I have tolerated you enough..\[Brother’s Employer\] won’t anymore.”_ in the morning of 19 May 2020. The Brother then posted a lengthy message on Facebook describing the problems he faced with the Sister. He later took this down on advice from the police.

## The parties’ cases

5       The Brother applied for a PPO on the basis that he has experienced family violence from the Sister in the manner of a physical assault on 28 April 2018 and subsequently in the form of continuous harassment that has caused him mental anguish.

6       The Sister defended against the grant of the PPO by denying any assault on the Brother as she acted in self-defence on 28 April 2018 and that her messages did not constitute any family violence. Further, she objects to a PPO on the basis that there is no necessity for a PPO because the Brother has moved out, they need no longer contact each other, they no longer have a brother-sister relationship and therefore are not family members.

## Issues to be determined

7       The issues to be determined are:-

> (a)     Whether the Sister caused hurt to the Brother on 28 April 2018;

> (b)     Whether the messages sent by the Sister as described in paragraph 3(b) caused continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member;

> (c)     Whether threats were made by the Sister to go to the Brother’s workplace and this constitutes continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member; and

> (d)     Whether there is necessity for a PPO to prevent family violence on the Brother.

## Issue 1: Whether the Sister caused hurt to the Brother on 28 April 2018

8       There was no dispute that there was an altercation on this date between the parties. The Sister’s account is that the Brother assaulted her by giving her a hard push at her chest area, almost fracturing her skull in the process. The Brother’s account is that in the course of an argument, his Sister was blocking him from going to the bathroom and in his personal space, so he gave her a push against her elbow to push her away. She then slapped, punched and kicked him. While he was in shock, she poured liquid over his head while verbally abusing him. He then pushed her away at her shoulders and she flew backwards.

9       There was a medical examination form submitted by the Brother as evidence. Although the Sister selectively highlighted portions of the doctor’s observations where he noted no visible bruising or swelling on certain body parts, there were clear indications of other injuries on the Brother:-

> (a)     Superficial scratches noted on Lt cheek;

> (b)     Sore in Rt temporomandibular joint, only on opening mouth;

> (c)     5x3cm area of bruising on Lt arm. Tender on palpation. Bruise is yellowish;

> (d)     Tender along Lt temporomandibular joint, no bruising or swelling;

> (e)     Tender area (2x2cm area) 3rd intercostal space immediately lateral to sternum; and

> (f)     3x3cm area of redness and \[_illegible_\] over soft tissue. No bruising visible[^1]; and

> (g)     Tender area 4x4cm area[^2].

10     The Sister admitted slapping the Brother but claims she did so in self-defence. After the incident, she also made a police report that the Brother outraged her modesty. She admitted pouring liquid on the Brother but says liquid is not threatening.

11     Based on the medical examination form submitted by the Brother, I find that he has proven the Sister had caused hurt to him on 28 April 2018. I also believe the sequence of events as put forth by him. According to him, he had pushed her leading to her fall _after_ he had been slapped, punched and kicked. If the Sister had been pushed hard first, according to her, she suffered severe injuries. If so, it is unlikely she would have been able to inflict the injuries on the Brother as listed in the medical examination form. Alternatively, she was not as injured as she claimed and was beating the Brother in retaliation as there was no allegation that the Brother persisted in making other attacks on her that required her to defend herself. I also find it hard to believe that pouring bath gel on the Brother (as the Sister herself puts it as being non-threatening) would be an act of self-defence. This revealed to me the mental state and motivations of the Sister. She was not acting in self-defence. Therefore, I find that the Sister did cause hurt to the Brother on 28 April 2018 intentionally and not in self-defence.

## Issue 2a: Messages from the Sister to the Brother on his then impending marriage

12     The Sister had very strong views about the Brother’s marriage as he was marrying a foreigner. She sent a number of lengthy messages to the Brother about the mistake he is making and also warned him not to visit their Mother if he proceeds with the wedding. Her messages castigated him on his foolishness and relied on many references to their religion to justify her stand that his marriage is wrong.

13     The Husband claims that the Sister’s frequent messages caused him tremendous stress during his wedding preparation, and he had to keep all his wedding plans a secret from her and even his Mother as he feared the Sister would show up and create a scene. This therefore caused him mental anguish and constitutes family violence as defined in section 94, under limb (d).

14     The Sister claims that she was only giving him marriage advice and at no time did he ask her to stop sending these messages or to say she was harassing him. Her position is this does not constitute continuous harassment.

15     It is reasonable that the Brother would find the messages from the Sister as a form of stress. However, I accept that the Sister was, from her perspective, persuading the Brother not to make a mistake in his life. Whether she is justified in her opinion that the marriage is a mistake is a different issue. However, family violence as defined under limb (d) has a requisite mental element. Continuous harassment must have been caused with _intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish_. In this regard, I do not find that there was an intention by the Sister to cause anguish or knowledge that what she considered as marriage advice is likely to cause anguish to the Brother. There were other evidence of the Sister sending her views of the Brother’s marriage to her friend, which came to the Brother’s knowledge. This may have led him to feel even more stressed and anguished but because they were not messages sent to him and she had no way of foreseeing her messages made known to him, I cannot find that she did this to cause him anguish. I accept that there is no evidence that the Brother told the Sister to stop messaging him and that she is harassing him. If that was proven, then my finding may be different as I would have inferred that the Sister has the necessary knowledge her conduct was likely to cause anguish to the Brother but persisted with her conduct intentionally to do so.

## Issue 2b: Threats by the Sister to go to the Brother’s workplace

16     This incident started on 18 May 2020 when the Brother visited the residence of the Sister and the Mother. The Brother’s version is he had sent a message to the Sister to inform her he will go over. He then went over a few hours after his message. He claims the visit started well, he passed the items he had brought for their Mother and he also collected some of his personal belongings. However, they started arguing about a past issue of his IRAS tax deduction and he left on a bad note. Subsequent to the visit, the Brother and Sister continued to text each other into the night and the Sister eventually sent this message.

#### “I have tolerated you enough..\[Brother’s Employer\] won’t anymore.”

17     The Brother claims that this message was a threat by the Sister to go to his employers \[Brother’s Employer\] and to involve them in their private dispute such that it will affect his livelihood. The identity of the Brother’s employers is redacted but suffice to say, his occupation can be affected by allegations of misconduct in his personal life. He also claims that this is not the first time she made such a threat to him.

18     The Sister claims she did not go to his employer’s office and the Brother has no proof that she did. The message written by her also does not prove she made such a threat. She believes this application for PPO is a plan by the Brother to prevent her from going to make an official complaint against the Brother to his employers that he had breached certain rules and regulations in his work.

19     I agree that the message by itself does not show any threat that she intended to go to the Brother’s employer. However, the message must be seen in the context of events that had just occurred. It was not disputed that the siblings have been arguing that night until early morning the next day and the Sister has been harbouring discontent with the Brother over a number of issues, such as their Mother’s care, his financial contribution to their Mother, the distribution of their Father’s estate, the Brother’s claim for tax deduction for an elderly parent when she claims he did not care for their Mother, the alleged mishandling of their Aunt’s financial affairs (which would be something that the Brother’s employer will look into). These issues have resurfaced over the years and in fact, were attempted to be raised during this trial. I allowed the parties to ventilate to a certain degree as their reactions to each other allowed me to assess the difficulties and ongoing recurring disputes they would have with each other. It was during the course of this interaction during the trial[^3], that the Sister expressed her intention to go to the Brother’s employers to verify his evidence regarding their knowledge of the Court proceedings. I reproduce the relevant extract of the transcript below

_“Sister:_

 | 

_No. I’m asking you police report. Don’t tell me something else. What did you write on your police report, the 1st paragraph, the most import paragraph?_

 |

_Yes.”_

 |

  
  

20     Prior to this during the trial, the Brother had expressly stated how her intention to go to his employers would jeopardise his rice bowl and this was causing him mental anguish. Therefore, unlike the earlier messages regarding the wedding, the Sister does know that by going to his employers to involve them in their private dispute, she is causing him anguish. I also believe that this was what she meant when she sent that message in the morning of 19 May 2020, i.e. she will be involving or informing the Brother’s employers in their private disputes and she also continued to threaten him with this during the trial.

21     Therefore, I find that the Brother has proven that the Sister has been threatening to go to his employers with the intention to cause him mental anguish.

## Issue 3: Whether there is a necessity for a PPO

22     I accept that the Brother and Sister are no longer living in the same residence, but the fact remains they remain bound by their Mother. As shown in the latest incident, because the Brother will continue to have interactions with the Sister from his visits to their Mother. Furthermore, the Sister is the Mother’s deputy. I reject the Sister’s submission that the Brother cannot be granted a PPO because he no longer treats her as a sister. Their relationship as a sister and brother in law is not affected by the strength of their affection to each other.

23     The WhatsApp messages over the years also supported the Brother’s explanation that he needed the PPO as the Sister would at times raise the previous issues of dispute. Without a PPO, the Sister may again raise the old disputes and/or threaten to involve his employers again.

## Conclusion

24     This is a case where if it was based only the documented evidence of harassment, the application for PPO may not succeed. Having parties on the stand and cross-examining each other revealed their personalities and usual manner of communication, which usually cannot be produced in the form of documentary evidence. Longer time was required for the trial because of the inflammatory manner in which the Sister conducted cross-examination and her often digression to irrelevant issues. However, this also revealed to me how she probably interacted with the Brother. Despite my many reminders throughout the entire course of proceedings to be civil and to stop interrupting the Brother, she could not control herself as she reacted emotionally to everything that the Brother attempted to say.

25     I agreed with the Brother that based on the past incident on 28 April 2018 and the continuing disputes between them, a PPO is necessary and therefore granted the PPO in his favour. I also ordered counselling for parties in the hope that their relationship or at least manner of communication can be improved as they remain bound to remain in contact due to their Mother.

26     There is an allegation being raised by the Sister regarding the Brother’s mishandling of their late aunt’s financial affairs, which would be a relevant concern to the Brother’s employer. Part of the Sister’s case is that this application for a PPO by the Brother is to prevent her from going to his employers to lodge a complaint (mentioned earlier in paragraph 18). However, as shown in paragraph 19 above, this was not the only purpose she wished to approach the Brother’s employer and she intended to make sure they were aware of all their other private disputes. I wish to clarify that my granting of a PPO does not prevent the Sister from lodging such a complaint that the Brother’s employer would have to investigate through their formal channels.
