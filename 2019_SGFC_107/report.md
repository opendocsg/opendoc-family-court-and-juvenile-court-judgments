Amendment – Variation of Consent Order – Res Judicata

4 October 2019

### District Judge Wendy Yu:

## Introduction

1       The parties are already divorced and the ancillaries were resolved with a consent order granted (together with the Interim Judgment) on 21 February 2018 (“the Consent Order”). The Plaintiff hereinafter referred to as “the Plaintiff”) was represented in the divorce proceedings while the Defendant (hereinafter referred to as “the Defendant”) was in person. As stated in the pleadings and Consent Order, the parties have two children in the marriage, namely B (male, born on xxx 2012) and C (female, born on xxx 2015). The Consent Order stated, _inter alia_, that parties shall have joint custody of the children of the marriage, with care and control to the Defendant while the Plaintiff shall be liberal access to the children of the marriage. The Certificate of Final Judgement was granted on 23 May 2018.

2       There was another child E (born on xxx 2014) (“E”), who is the biological child of the Plaintiff but not the biological child of the Defendant[^1]. E was not listed as a child of the marriage in the divorce papers. This issue became a point of contention between parties in this application before me.

3       On the issue of matrimonial assets, paragraph 3(c)(i) of the Consent Order stated as follows:

> _“(i_)     _That all of the Plaintiff’s rights, title and interest in the matrimonial flat at xxx shall be transferred to the Defendant within 3 months from the date of the Final Judgment, upon the Defendant paying a sum equivalent to 40% of the market value of the flat less outstanding mortgage loan to the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff shall refund her own CPF account with accrued interest for funds paid towards the purchase of the said flat. The Defendant shall be solely responsible for the payment of the outstanding mortgage loan (if any) and all costs and expenses of transfer._

> (_ii_)   _In the event that the Defendant does not wish to take over the ownership of the matrimonial flat at xxx, all of the Defendant’s rights, title and interest in the matrimonial flat at xxx shall be transferred to the Plaintiff within 6 months from the date of the Final Judgment, upon the Plaintiff paying a sum equivalent to 60% of the market value of the flat less outstanding mortgage loan to the Defendant. The Defendant shall refund his own CPF account with accrued interest for funds paid towards the purchase of the said flat. The Plaintiff shall be solely responsible for the payment of the outstanding mortgage loan (if any) and all costs and expenses of transfer._

> (_iii_)   _the Registrar or Deputy Registrar of the Family Justice Courts under section 31 of the Family Justice Act No. 27 of 2014 is empowered to execute, sign or indorse all necessary documents relating to matters contained in this order on behalf of either party should either party fail to do so within seven (7) days of written request being made to the party.”_

4       The Plaintiff filed an application (SUM 281/2019) on 22 January 2019 for the following orders,

> _“1_.     _That paragraph 4 of the Statement of Claim for Divorce be amended to include the particulars of E (Birth Certificate No. xxx);_

> _2_.     _Following an order granted for amendment pursuant to (1) above (if any), that 3(c)(ii) be varied as follows:_

>> _“The Plaintiff be entitled to take over the Defendant’s rights, title and interests in the matrimonial flat located at xxx (“the Matrimonial Flat”) within 6 months from the date of the Order herein, upon the Plaintiff paying the Defendant a sum equivalent to 60% of the market value of the Matrimonial Flat, less outstanding mortgage loan to the Defendant. The Defendant shall refund his own CPF account with accrued interests for funds paid towards the purchase of the said flat. The Plaintiff shall be solely responsible for the payment of the outstanding mortgage loan (if any) and all costs and expenses of transfer.”_

> _3_.     _Following an order granted for amendment pursuant to (i) above (if any), that 3(c)(ii) be amended to include as follows:_

>> _“For the avoidance of doubt, the calculation of the consideration payable by the Plaintiff to the Defendant shall be calculated as follows:-_

>>> _A_.     _Parties shall first ascertain what is 60% of the market value of the Matrimonial Flat;_

>>> _B_.     _Thereafter, the sum payable by the Plaintiff to the Defendant shall be equivalent of the sum in (A) hereinabove less the outstanding mortgage loan.”_

> _4_.     _That in the interim pending the outcome of this application, the Defendant be restrained from effecting the transfer of the ownership of the matrimonial flat located at xxx (“the Matrimonial Flat”) to his sole name;_

> _5_.     _That the Defendant pays the sum of S$1,200 as monthly for the child of the marriage, E (Birth Cert No. xxx)_

> _6_.     _Costs;_

> _7_.     _Such further and other orders as the Honourable Court deems fit.”_

5       The Defendant subsequently filed an application in SUM 1220/2019 on 10 April 2019 asking for orders to be made to give effect to paragraphs 3(c)(i) and (iii) of the Interim Judgment dated 21 February 2018 as follows:

> _a_.     _That all of the Plaintiff’s rights, title and interest in the matrimonial flat at xxx (“Matrimonial Flat”) shall be transferred to the Defendant within 3 months from the date of this Order of Court, upon the Defendant paying a sum of $260,000 (equivalent to 40% of the market value of the flat being $650,000) less outstanding mortgage loan to the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff shall refund her own CPF account with accrued interest for funds paid towards the purchase of the said flat. The Defendant shall be solely responsible for the payment of the outstanding mortgage loan (if any) and all costs and expenses of transfer;_

> _b_.     _The Registrar or Deputy Registrar of the Family Justice Courts under Section 31 of the Family Justice Act No. 27 of 2014 is empowered to execute, sign, or indorse all necessary documents relating to the transfer of the Matrimonial Flat on behalf of the Plaintiff;_

> _c_.     _If the HDB is not prepared to act for the Plaintiff in the transfer, and the Plaintiff does not appoint her conveyancing solicitors within seven (7) days of written request being made to the Plaintiff, then the Defendant’s conveyancing solicitors Serene Chan & Co. shall be authorised to act for both parties in the transfer;_

> _d_.     _For the transfer of the Matrimonial Flat, the Defendant shall pay the Plaintiff a sum of $260,000 less 40% of the outstanding mortgage loan. After deducting the refund to the Plaintiff’s CPF account with accrued interest for funds paid towards the purchase of the said flat, the balance cash proceeds (subject to the deduction of costs of these proceedings ordered herein) shall be paid to the Plaintiff by either of the following methods upon completion of the transfer or upon the Plaintiff vacating the Matrimonial Flat, whichever is later:-_

>> (_i_)     _If Plaintiff appoints her own conveyancing solicitors, the casher’s order in favour of the Plaintiff shall be handed to the Plaintiff’s solicitors; or_

>> (_ii_)    _If Plaintiff does not appoint her own conveyancing solicitors, the casher’s order in favour of the Plaintiff shall be deposited by Serene Chan & Co into the Plaintiff’s POSB Account No. xxx._

> _e_.     _Costs of this Summons and Summons No. FC/SUM 281/2019 to be paid by the Plaintiff to the Defendant, such costs to be deducted from the Plaintiff’s net sale proceeds of the Matrimonial Flat; and_

> _f_.     _Such further or other reliefs as the Court deems fit.”_

## The Plaintiff’s Submissions

6       The Plaintiff’s application to amend the pleadings of the divorce is because there is another child, E, who is about 4 years and 3 months at the time of filing of the Plaintiff’s 1st affidavit[^2], who was not included in the pleadings as a child of the marriage when the divorce papers were filed. The Plaintiff has stated in her submissions that E “is a child of the marriage who ought to have been included in the Statement of Claim and to whom the Defendant is liable to maintain.”[^3]

7       The Plaintiff’s counsel has cited the case of **EB v EC <span class="citation">\[2006\] 2 SLR 475</span>** to support her argument that once the Defendant had accepted E as a child of the family he should not be able to change his mind.[^4] The Plaintiff has also used s122, s123 and s 92 of the Women’s Charter to support her argument that the divorce proceedings ought to take into account all the children of the marriage[^5]. The Plaintiff further contended that as E’s name was excluded in the Statement of Claim, this should be rectified and a claim for E’s maintenance should be heard now as well,[^6] as the Defendant had accepted E as a member of his family under s 70 of the Women’s Charter.[^7] The Plaintiff has also asserted that as E is currently not maintained by his biological father, the Defendant should assist the Plaintiff in maintaining E.[^8] According to the Plaintiff, her previous lawyers had advised her that E’s name was not to be included in the pleadings at the divorce.[^9] The Plaintiff has explained that as E was a child born during the course of the marriage and the Defendant having had accepted him, she needed to include E in the relevant documents and also to assist her in the process of obtaining financial assistance from HDB to purchase the matrimonial flat[^10].

8       The Plaintiff has explained that there was a delay in her taking over the matrimonial flat as her housing loan was only approved on 7 November 2018[^11] and because of E’s status in the divorce proceedings[^12]. The Plaintiff has also argued that the Defendant had reneged on their agreement by intending to take over the matrimonial flat in 27 December 2018 and parties were not able to agree on the market value of the flat.[^13] The Plaintiff has requested for more time to take over the matrimonial flat[^14], and is asking for the market value to be fixed at $564,590.00 which was the purchase price of the matrimonial flat[^15].

9       The Plaintiff further explained that the Consent Order as drafted in the Interim Judgment was “completely contrary” to what she had understood and that she “had not been adequately advised previously”.[^16]

## The Defendant’s Submissions

10     The Defendant had resisted the Plaintiff’s application to amend the Statement of Claim to include E’s particulars and to include a consequent claim for maintenance for E. The Defendant had emphasized that the original Interim Judgment was made by consent between both parties and it was the Plaintiff’s then lawyers who had handled the divorce proceedings while the Defendant was in person. Particulars of E were not included in the divorce papers which had been prepared by the Plaintiff’s then lawyers.[^17] The Defendant has also disagreed that he had accepted E as a child of the family.[^18] The Defendant further submitted that it was the common understanding between parties during the divorce proceedings that E was not his biological son and so E was excluded from the divorce negotiations as he was not considered a child of the marriage.[^19]

11     The Defendant has also challenged the Plaintiff’s reasoning that the inclusion of E is to aid her in securing financial assistance from HDB as she has already secured the loan despite her income exceeding the $6,000 ceiling of the Single Parent Scheme[^20]. The Defendant has contended that the Plaintiff intention for including E now is to make a claim for maintenance for E. The Defendant has disputed the validity of such a claim as even if the Defendant has accepted E as a child of the family (which is disputed by the Defendant), s70(1) of the Women’s Charter provides that such an obligation only arises when the biological father and mother of the child fails to do so. The Plaintiff has been enjoying a monthly income of more than $6,000 and is more than able to maintain E.[^21] Furthermore, the Defendant has argued that the Plaintiff should make a claim for maintenance from E’s biological father if she is really in need of such contribution.[^22]

12     The Defendant has acknowledged that the Plaintiff had expressed her intention to take over the matrimonial flat and was willing to accommodate her intention to do so, provided that she effected the transfer before November 2018.[^23] The Defendant’s position is that due to the Plaintiff’s inability to finance the flat and her insistence on undervaluing that flat, the transfer did not take place by November 2018.[^24]

13     The Defendant’s Counsel has highlighted the Court of Appeal case of **AYM v AYL <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGCA 68</span>** (hereinafter referred to as “_AYM_”) to highlight their point that the Court would only make the necessary variations to an order for a division of matrimonial asset where the order was unworkable or has become unworkable due to new circumstances that have arisen. [^25] The Defendant has submitted that the order is fully workable and that it is impossible for the Plaintiff to claim at this juncture that she did not understand the terms of the order when it was drafted by her then lawyers.[^26] The Defendant further submitted that in _AYM_ at \[29\], the Court noted that a fundamental misunderstanding on the face of that order that causes it to be unworkable would justify a variation, but the Plaintiff has shown no evidence for this.[^27] The Defendant had also cited the case of **UMM v UML <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHCF 13</span>** (“_UMM_”) to contend that signing a consent order without understanding is no excuse to escape the agreement, especially when there is a need for finality.[^28]

## Hearing & Orders Made

14     The hearings for both summonses took place on 29 May 2019 and 24 June 2019. At the start of the second hearing on 24 June 2019, the Plaintiff had sought for an adjournment to ask for more time for another lawyer in the firm to take client’s instructions. Plaintiff’s counsel has also sought leave to amend the prayers in the Plaintiff’s application to that of setting aside of the orders instead of an amendment of the Statement of Claim. The Defendant’s counsel had objected strenuously to these requests. I did not grant the Plaintiff leave to amend her application then as the matter was already part heard and the Plaintiff’s counsel had been given ample time to take the Plaintiff’s instructions beforehand. The matter had to be heard expeditiously and any further delay would not be in the interest of justice.

15     For the Plaintiff’s application in SUM 281/2019, the Plaintiff had asked for leave to withdraw prayer 3 on the day of the hearing on 24 June 2019, which the Court had granted leave for the Plaintiff to do so. I had dismissed the rest of the application save for prayers 4 and 7 where I made no orders to the same.

16     For the Defendant’s application in SUM 1220/2019, I made the following orders:

> (1)     That further orders be made to give effect to paragraphs 3(c)(i) and (iii) of the Interim Judgment dated 21 February 2018 as follows:

>> 1(a)       That all of the Plaintiff’s rights, title and interest in the matrimonial flat at xxx (“Matrimonial Flat” shall be transferred to the Defendant within 3 months from the date of this Order of Court, upon the Defendant paying a sum equivalent to 40% of the market value of the flat less outstanding mortgage loan to the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff shall refund her own CPF account with accrued interest for funds paid towards the purchase of the said flat. The Defendant shall be solely responsible for the payment of the outstanding mortgage loan (if any) and all costs and expenses of transfer.

17     I have granted prayer 1 (a) of the Defendant’s application save for the point that I did not include in the order that the sum to be paid by the Defendant should be fixed as $260,000, but rather, 40% of the market value, of which the market value had to be ascertained by an independent valuer. I made an order to facilitate the implementation of the consent order, as to the ascertainment of the “market value” of the matrimonial flat, that “Paragraph(c)(iv) to be added to the Interim Judgment dated 21 February 2018 to read as follows: ‘The market value shall be ascertained by an independent valuer. The Defendant shall select 3 independent valuers and out of the 3 selected valuers, the Plaintiff shall appoint one valuer. The market value of the flat shall be ascertained by this independent valuer.”

18     I made no orders for prayer 1(b) for an inclusion of a Registrar’s Empowerment Clause as there was already such a clause in the consent order. I have dismissed prayer 1(c) and 1(d) as I was not satisfied that there was any unworkability in the Consent Order to warrant a variation. There was no evidence that these prayers were part of the parties’ intentions in the original consent order nor were they necessary to give effect to the consent order.

19     I have also ordered the Plaintiff to pay the Defendant costs fixed at $1,200 for both summonses.

## Appeal

20     The Plaintiff has appealed against the entire order. I will now give my reasons for my decision.

## Law

21     S112(4) of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353) states:

> _“The Court may, at any time it thinks fit, extend, vary, revoke or discharge any order made under this section, and may vary any term or condition upon or subject to which any such order has been made.”_

22     The power to vary a consent order on the division of assets under s112(4) is to be exercised narrowly[^29], and an applicant must prove one of the vitiating factors, or that the order was or has become unworkable[^30]. The Court would, pursuant to s112(4), make, _inter alia_, the necessary variations to an order for the division of matrimonial assets only where the order was unworkable ab initio or has become unworkable as a result of new circumstances[^31]. When the Court hears a variation application, it does not re-visit the original orders with the effect of disregarding the original order that is the subject of the variation application[^32]. I had agreed with the Defendant’s submission that the Consent Order is fully workable. There was no evidence before me that the Consent Order was unworkable _ab initio_ or that there were new circumstances which have arisen that have rendered the Consent Order unworkable. I have essentially dismissed the prayers of both parties to vary the Consent Order, save for the prayers that would facilitate the implementation of the Consent Order.

## Transfer of Matrimonial Flat

23     At the hearing, both parties have expressed their intention to take over the matrimonial flat[^33]. Pursuant to the Consent Order, it was the parties’ intention that the Defendant was to have prior right to take over the matrimonial flat. Prayer 2 of the Plaintiff’s application was dismissed because the Plaintiff was asking for priority over the Defendant when this was not in the Consent Order. I have also dismissed prayer 1(c) and 1(d) of the Defendant’s application as there was no evidence that these prayers were part of the parties’ intention in the Consent Order nor were they necessary to give effect to the Consent Order. The Court is mindful not to disregard the original order which was the subject of the variation application.

24     I have also agreed with Defendant’s counsel that the Plaintiff’s insistence on the value of the flat to be that of the original purchase price to be unreasonable[^34] but I was also of the view that the Defendant should not fix it at $650,000. Even if the Court allows a variation of the Consent Order, the Court must be mindful of the original intention of parties. It is clear from the Consent Order that parties have specified that “the market value of that flat” was to be considered in the transfer, instead of the purchase price of the flat. The powers to vary an order under s112(2) is to have a limited operation only[^35]. To break the impasse and to provide clarity, I have ordered that the market value shall be ascertained by an independent valuer, in order to ensure the implementation of the Consent Order. The Defendant shall select 3 independent valuers and out of the 3 selected valuers, the Plaintiff shall appoint one valuer. The market value of the flat shall be ascertained by this independent valuer.

25     There was also a dispute at the hearing as to how the consideration should be calculated. While the Plaintiff had asked for leave to withdraw prayer 3 of her application, I would like to set this out here to ensure clarity and prevent any further acrimony.

26     The Defendant’s Counsel had submitted a document “Computation of Consideration” during the hearing on the calculations of the parties, which I had marked as “Annex A”, as follows:

> **_Computation of Consideration_**

> _For Transfer of Matrimonial Flat to the Defendant_

> _Interim Judgment Formula_

> _40% x (Market Value- Mortgage Loan)_

> _\= 40% x ($650,000 - $280,000)_

> _\= 40% x $370,000_

> _\= $148,000_

> _Defendant Husband’s Formula_

> _(40% x Market Value)- (40% x Mortgage Loan)_

> _\= (40% x $650,000)- (40% x $280,000)_

> _\= $260,000-$112,000_

> _\=$148,000_

> _Plaintiff’s Wife’s Formula_

> _(40% x Market Value) – (100% X Mortgage Loan)_

> _\= (40% x $650,000) – ($280,000)_

> _\=$260,000 - $280,000_

> _\= \[20,000\]_

27     While the “Interim Judgment Formula” and “the Defendant Husband’s Formula” seemed to arrive at the same figure, it is clear that parties must follow the manner of calculation as per the “Interim Judgment Formula”, although the market value is to be set by an independent valuer and not as $650,000 as proposed by the Defendant. The Plaintiff’s counsel had at the hearing on 24 June 2019 conceded that they had explained to their client that “the norm is the IJ Formula that was stated in (Defendant’s counsel’s) submissions” and had therefore asked to withdraw prayer 3 of their application.

## On the issue of Amendment to include E in Statement of Claim & Claim for maintenance

28     I have also agreed with the Defendant’s submission that the Plaintiff’s application to amend the Statement of Claim to include E’s particulars after Final Judgment has had been granted as “misconceived”[^36]. I had asked Plaintiff’s counsel if she could assist the Court in submitting any authorities to support her position that the Court has powers to “amend” a Statement of Claim to include the particulars of an additional child and for the Plaintiff to make an additional claim for maintenance for that child when Final judgment had been already been granted. At the hearing, the Plaintiff’s counsel had cited Rule 424 as authority to substantiate her client’s application to amend the pleadings.

29     For ease of reference, I will reproduce Rule 424(1) of the FJR here:

> _“424(1_)     _The Court may, at any stage of the proceedings and either of its own motion or on the application of any party to the proceedings, order any document in the proceedings to be amended on such terms as to costs or otherwise as may be just and in such manner (if any) as it may direct, for the purpose of –_

>> (_a_)     _Determining the real question in controversy between the parties to any proceedings; or_

>> (b)     _Correcting any defect or error in any proceedings_”

30     Rule 424 (1) can apply “at any stage of the proceedings” but it does not give the Court the power to amend court documents after the Final Judgment has been granted. It is clearly stated in Rule 424(2) of the FJR that “this rule shall not have effect in relation to a judgment or an order”. The Plaintiff’s application was not to set aside the Interim Judgment or Final Judgment. While the Plaintiff’s counsel had, at the second hearing on 24 June 2019 sought leave to amend her application to that of setting aside of the orders as the Plaintiff’s counsel conceded that it should have been an application for setting aside[^37], leave was not granted as the matter was already part heard. Even if leave was granted for the Plaintiff to apply to set aside the Interim Judgment, there remains a question as to whether the Plaintiff would be able to meet the threshold of setting aside the Interim Judgment. However, I did not see any need to deal with this issue of setting aside as it was not an issue before me at the hearing.

31     On the issue of adding a claim for monthly maintenance for E (prayer 5 of the Plaintiff’s application), when the Court invited the Plaintiff’s counsel to address the Court on the issue of _res judicata_, the Plaintiff’s counsel did not offer any substantive authorities on this issue.

32     Parties should not be allowed to re-litigate a matter to which they had been a party. I quote George Wei JC (as he then was) in the High Court case of **Zhang Run Zi v Koh Kim Seng <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 175</span>** (hereinafter referred to as _Zhang Run Zi_ ) at \[35\] on the doctrine of _res judicata_:

> \[35\]  “The doctrine of _res judicata_ has often been described as an ‘umbrella doctrine’ encompassing three conceptually distinct though interrelated principles, namely, cause of action estoppel, issue estoppel, and the “extended doctrine of _res judicata_” or defence of abuse of process: _Goh Nellie v Goh Lian Teck <span class="citation">\[2007\] 1 SLR(R) 453</span> (“Goh Nellie”) at \[17\]-\[19\], Wing Joo Loon Ginseng Hong (Singapore) Co Pte Ltd v Qinghai Xinyuan Foreign Trade Co Ltd and another and another appeal \[2009\] 2 SLR (R) 814 (“Wing Joo Loong”) at \[165\], Manharlal Trikamdas Mody v Sumikin Bussan International (HK) Ltd <span class="citation">\[2014\] 3 SLR 1161</span> (“Manharlal Trikamdas”) at \[133\]”_

33     JC Wei (as he then was), after discussing the cause of action estoppel and issue estoppel proceeded to discuss that of the defence of abuse of process (the “extended” doctrine of _res judicata_) at \[60\] and \[61\]:

> “In _Henderson v Henderson_, the _local classicus_ on the defence of abuse of process, the Court held (at 115):

>> ….where a given matter becomes the subject of litigation in, and of adjudication by, a Court of competent jurisdiction, the Court requires the parties to that litigation to bring forward their whole case, and will not (except under special circumstances) permit the same parties to open the same subject of litigation in respect of matter which might have been brought forward as part of the subject in contest, but which was not brought forward, only because they have, from negligence, inadvertence, or even accident, omitted part of their case. The plea of _res judicata_ applies, except in special cases, not only to points upon which the Court was actually required by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce a judgment, but to every point which properly belonged to the subject of litigation, and which the parties, exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time.

> \[61\]  This explication of the defence of abuse of process was affirmed by the Singapore Court of Appeal at _Ching Mun Fong_ at \[22\]. Crucially, the defence of abuse of process allows the Court to bar an action from proceeding _even if the issues raised therein were never litigated or decided on before_, but ought to have been raised in previous litigation. The basis for the defence is the public interest in protecting the Court’s processes from abuse and protecting defendants from oppression: _Ching Mun Fong_ at \[23\] and _Kwa Ban Cheong_ at \[26\].”

34     While the Court is not to “adopt an inflexible or unyielding attitude” in determining whether there was an abuse of process (_Goh Nellie_ at \[53\]), the Court has to consider the overall justice of the case, including the concern of ensuring finality in judicial decisions. The irony in this case was that it was the Plaintiff who had the benefit of being legally represented at the divorce while the Defendant was in person. If the Plaintiff was of the view that there should be a claim for maintenance for E or that E should be included as that of a child of the marriage, the Plaintiff should have brought that forward before Interim Judgment was granted, as this was a fact that already existed at the filing of the Statement of Claim. To allow the Plaintiff to make a claim for maintenance at this point in time when Final Judgment had already been granted would amount to an abuse of process. The Plaintiff cannot subsequently change her mind to make a claim for maintenance of a child whom she had consciously decided not to include in the pleadings when she had a chance to do so when she the benefit of independent legal advice. The issue of child maintenance was agreed upon in the Consent Order and the Plaintiff’s counsel had conceded that there were no material change in circumstances to warrant a variation. Furthermore, the issue of maintenance of the children were part of the Consent Order of which the Plaintiff had agreed to with legal advice. While the Plaintiff had explained that she was not adequately advised, she should not be given special allowance to have a second bite of the cherry on this basis alone. In any case, s70(1) provides that maintenance should be first sought from biological parents, and there was no evidence before me that the Plaintiff had made any attempt to do so from E’s biological father, and neither was there sufficient evidence to persuade me that the Plaintiff would not be able financially to maintain E[^38].

35     For the above reasons, I have made the orders as stated in paragraph 16 above and had ordered costs of $1,200 in total to be paid by Plaintiff to Defendant (for both applications).
