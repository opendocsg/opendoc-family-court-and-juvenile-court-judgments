Family Violence and Personal Protection Order

27 October 2020

### District Judge Toh Wee San:

1       These were two applications filed by the Complainant wife (W) against the Respondent husband (H) and Respondent mother in law (MIL) for two personal protection orders (PPOs) against each one of them for committing family violence on her.

2       After hearing them, I granted a PPO against H for one year from the date of issue but dismissed the complaint against MIL. H filed an appeal against my decision and I provide my reasons below.

3       With respect to the application against H, essentially, I found that the W has proven on a balance of probabilities that H had committed family violence against W and there was a necessity for such a PPO at this juncture as parties will be meeting regularly for child access.

## Background facts

### The parties

4       Parties married around end 2016 in India and W moved to Singapore on or about 11 February 2017. W is an Indian citizen and a Singapore permanent resident. H is a Singapore Citizen. There is a son to the marriage (the child) and he was born on 24 September 2017.

5       Their marriage was rocky. W had left the matrimonial home several times prior to the present incident due to the acrimonious relationship that parties had.

### Legal proceedings

6       In 2018, W had filed a PPO application against H but subsequently withdrew the application. W also did not have a good relationship with H’s mother (MIL). W moved out of the matrimonial home sometime in 2018 as a result of a dispute with MIL. W subsequently returned to the matrimonial flat. However W no longer sleep in the same bedroom as H. She continued to have a bad relationship with H and MIL.

7       W had also filed an application for custody, care and control for the child in 2018 where parties entered into a consent order. Amongst others, parties are to have joint custody of the child, with sole care and control to W and access to H.

## The parties’ cases in brief

8       The incident took place on 2 February 2020 at the matrimonial home. Parties and MIL were at home with the child (then 2+ years old). It was about mid-day and W was preparing lunch for herself in the kitchen. MIL, H and the child were in the living hall. W heard MIL sneezed and told MIL to cover her mouth before sneezing or to wear a face mask. MIL responded and W took out her mobile phone with the intention of making a recording.

### The Wife’s case

9       W alleged that MIL was angry and used abusive language on her. Hence W took out her mobile phone to record MIL’s conduct. This angered MIL who asked R to snatch W’s phone from her and break it. R heard MIL and sprang on W. There was a struggle between the couple and MIL held W’s waist tightly from the back to enable R to snatch W’s phone from W. Before R could do so, W bit R’s hand which caused R to release W. W then broke free and ran into a room and tried to close the door. H dashed after W and forced open the door to enter the room. W placed her mobile phone on the bed and sat on it. H rolled her off the bed by force, like a wrestler and W fell on the floor. H took W’s handphone from the bed and left the room. W wanted to but could not call the police. Hence she took the housekeys, ran out of the flat and went down to the void deck. Meanwhile H called the police and the police arrived at the void deck and met W. The police interviewed W and accompanied her back to the house. H complained to the police that W started the fight, had mental illness and wanted the police to bring W to the Institute of Mental Health (IMH). W objected to H’s claim, countered that she was normal and showed the police the court order that she had care and control over the child. The police advised W not to fight with H and to move out only the next day. W took the police’s advice. After the incident W also went to the Singapore General Hospital Accident & Emergency Department (SGH A & E) to seek treatment.

10     W’s counsel (WC) argued that W’s story should be believed as it was illogical for W to have reached for her mobile phone to record the said event if MIL had not used abusive language on her. WC pointed out that H had admitted in the police report that he filed on 14 March 2020 which was more than a month later that he had “intervened” in the situation, to which, W counsel submitted to refer to H snatching the mobile phone from W. WC pointed out that H filed the police report after being notified of the PPO complaint filed by W. WC further submitted that W ran away from the flat while holding on to the padlock due to the way H used force on her. WC also referred to two documents issued by SGH and one police report lodged by W. First was the letter issued by SGH A & E dated 2 February 2020 to the SGH Hand Surgery Department to request that the latter see W. Second was a medical report dated 13 April 2020 issued by SGH. Both the letter and report from SGH contained details about the incident reported by W to and injuries diagnosed by the doctor. The details of the incident recorded were consistent with W’s testimony before me. The primary and secondary diagnosis recorded in the letter were assault and finger pain respectively. The report further elaborated on the altercation between W, H and MIL. The details of the injuries recorded were abrasions found on W’s right finger, over her right anterior shin and scratch marks over both forearms. WC submitted that these injuries were consistent with W’s testimony of what H did to her. Similarly W’s police report dated 1 April 2020 contained details of the incident which were consistent with her evidence in court.

11     WC further submitted that a protection order was necessary as there had been many previous instances of assault by H and MIL. WC’s counsel referred to the police reports filed by W in 2018 and 2019 where she had placed on record the separate instances whereby H and W had assaulted her.

12     W’s counsel explained that there were ongoing access arrangements and a high propensity for parties to meet. As such, it was submitted that a PPO was necessary to ensure W’s safety during the access.

### The Husband’s case

13     H denied committing family violence against W and insisted that he had no intentions to cause any harm to W. H’s story was MIL was lying on the sofa while he was lying on the floor beside baby. MIL and H were rocking the child in a fixed spring cloth cot to sleep. MIL coughed and W asked MIL to wear a mask. MIL said “buy me a mask, I would wear”. W took out her phone to video and charge at MIL. H quickly went in between W and MIL to act as a cushion. H denied touching W, struggling with W, chasing her to a room and using force on her. Then W ran out of the house and H found that W had taken the padlock. H called the police and told the police that W was violent. Finally the police arrived at the house with W. H admitted that he made his police report a month after the incident and receiving the summons re W’s complaint for a PPO against him.

14     MIL also testified but she denied that she prepared the written statement for use in court nor was it translated to her. MIL gave oral testimony in court. MIL admitted that she was not on talking terms with W for about 6 to 12 months before the incident. MIL testified that on the day in question, she was sleeping on the sofa and rocking the child. Due to W’s cooking, the smell caused MIL to cough. W came to the hall angrily and asked her to wear a mask. MIL told W “if you buy for me, I will wear”. W used vulgarities in the kitchen and MIL told W not to shout. W took out her mobile phone and started to take pictures of her. W told MIL “now you talk, now you talk.”. Then H woke up and told W to go inside. MIL initially claimed that she did not know what went on in the room. However she subsequently changed her evidence to no one went inside the room. And W ran away once H called the police. MIL said she carried the baby in the hall and shortly after, the police came. When asked why did W point her mobile phone at her, MIL alleged that W often did this to bully her and take pictures.

15     H took the position that W had an explosive temperament and would rage even when H made an innocent comment. H had previously admitted W to the IMH for an assessment on W’s mental health where she was discharged subsequently. As such, H submitted that W bore a grudge against him or had mental illness of some sort.

## Issue to be determined

16     The issue to determine before me was whether H had committed family violence against W and if so, whether a PPO ought to be issued against him?

## Decision and reasons

17     I applied the relevant laws[^1] and granted W’s application for a protection order against H but limited to one year.

18     Based on the evidence before me, I was of the view that W has proven on the balance of probabilities that family violence had been committed against her by H. I note that W had sustained injuries on her body, albeit superficial, and had sought medical attention. I did not find H and MIL to be credible witnesses. In particular, MIL was evasive and constantly looked at H when giving her evidence until she was told by me to look at me when testifying. MIL also changed her evidence on one pertinent point i.e. from her initial evidence that W and H went into the room but she did not know what happened inside the room, to “they did not go into the room”. H on the other hand testified that he had not touched W nor entered the room with her at all. However H’s position cannot explain the injuries sustained by W as detailed in the medical report. I found that it was not likely for W to self-inflict those injuries. On the other hand, W’s story was credible and supported by documentary evidence. After the incident on the same day, W went to SGH to seek treatment. Her version of event and her injuries were captured in the SGH A & E’s letter and subsequent medical report. She also provided a police report which were much more detailed than the one lodged by H and consistent with her evidence in court The next day after the incident, W left the flat with her child and did not return anymore. In my view, these reactions are consistent and telling of a person who can no longer take it anymore.

19     However, I was not persuaded that H is a violent person by nature. I took the view that this unfortunate incident happened by virtue of the circumstances. Since parties were going through a divorce and would be meeting regularly for child access, a PPO for W against H was necessary. However, once the divorce was concluded, parties would have secured a clear care and access arrangement for the child, by which time, a PPO would no longer be necessary.

## Conclusion

20     In view of the above, I urged parties to put the past behind and co-parent peacefully. I reminded parties that any violent acts would not be tolerated and could amount to criminal offences. Similarly, the misuse of the PPO is a criminal offence.
