Family law – Guardianship of Infants Act – Relocation – Choice of school – Access

10 March 2020

### District Judge Kathryn Thong:

## Introduction

1       These are consolidated grounds of decision that deal with (a) my decision for parties’ 10-year-old son, R, to be enrolled in a London school which I shall refer to as Allsworth, and (b) my orders on the Plaintiff Father’s access to R in London. Though my decision on both matters were rendered on different days, given that they are closely related and were both argued together, I find it expeditious to render my grounds collectively.

2       Parties are unmarried and have joint custody of R, with care and control to the Mother, under a consent order made in June 2017.

3       In his judgment _ULA v UKZ_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHCF 19</span> released on 5 December 2018, the learned Judicial Commissioner Tan Puay Boon (“JC Tan”) ordered that the Mother be allowed to relocate to London with R on a date to be agreed between parties. Likewise, regarding R’s school in London and other attendant matters pertaining to the relocation, parties were directed to agree on them, failing which, the matter would be remitted to this Court.

4       Quite expectedly, parties disagreed which school R should attend in London. The discrete issues before me was which school as proposed by the parties would be in R’s best interests for him to be enrolled in, as well as the Father’s access in London.

5       I eventually decided on the Mother’s proposed school of Allsworth. As I stated in my brief grounds to counsel, all the schools put forth by parties were good schools. What tipped the scales in Allsworth’s favour was the Mother’s subtle consideration of how R would assimilate into Allsworth, and the fact that unlike the three schools proposed by the Father, R had already secured a place at Allsworth having sat for the necessary assessments. Further, given that parties had been litigating over the relocation and related matters since July 2017, I found it was in R’s overall best interests to finalise his school sooner, rather than later, which would be the inevitable scenario if he were to be subjected to further assessments for enrolment in other schools.

## Background

6       At the time of the hearing, R had just turned 10, and was studying at a Singapore international school which I shall refer to as “SIS”. The school term for Allsworth was to commence in early September 2019.

7       Some context to the litigation is necessary to appreciate parties’ overall circumstances and crucially, R’s. Back in June 2017, a consent order was recorded for parties to have joint custody of R and the Mother, care and control of R. The Father is based in New Zealand and has largely been so since R’s birth.

8       In July 2017, the Mother sought to relocate to London with R. In November 2017, I dismissed the Mother’s application. In December 2018, the learned JC Tan allowed the Mother’s appeal.

9       Dissatisfied with JC Tan’s decision, the Father sought leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal _vide_ SUM 384/2018. In March 2019, JC Tan dismissed the Father’s application and on 12 April 2019, the Court of Appeal similarly denied the Father’s leave application to the Court of Appeal _(vide_ CA/OS 4 of 2019).

10     Sometime in February 2019, prior to JC Tan’s and the Court of Appeal’s respective decisions to deny leave, the Mother arranged for R to sit for an assessment test at SIS for enrolment into Allsworth. Clearly she did not inform the Father of this arrangement, as on 27 February 2019, the Father expressed his shock through his solicitors that he had been informed by SIS that arrangements were being made for R to sit for an assessment for enrolment into a London school. In the dark as to which school this was, the Father requested that the Mother withdraw her request for R to sit for such a test. He stressed that they were to jointly discuss R’s London school as directed by JC Tan.

11     On 5 March 2019, the Mother responded through her solicitors that the test was for entry into Allsworth, which had already been raised as a potential school back in 2017 in the relocation application. It was thus surprising that the Father claimed he was unaware of the school the Mother wished to enrol R in. In any event, she invited the Father to respond within 7 days as to alternative schools.

12     On 22 March 2019, the Father’s solicitors wrote back that Allsworth was simply mentioned “in passing” in the relocation application and it was disingenuous to suggest that the Father should have known it was her intent to enrol R there. He iterated his position that the Mother did not try to engage with him on R’s arrangements since JC Tan’s decision on 5 December 2018. The letter added that the Father planned to visit Allsworth to ascertain its suitability and that he would be engaging a London-based educational consultant specialising in helping families select schools for relocation.

13     In addition, the Father requested for information including but not limited to matters such as the Mother’s working hours and care arrangements, and reasons why she thought Allsworth was suitable. The Mother did not reply and the Father’s solicitors wrote again on 15 April 2018.

14     On 18 April 2019, the Mother responded to the Father’s various queries. She also enclosed a report on Allsworth published in ‘The Independent Schools Inspectorate Report 2018’ (“ISIR”), and highlighted that a consultant had recommended the school. She also asked for the identity of the Father’s educational consultant.

15     On 29 April 2019, the Father stated again his written objections to R sitting for the assessment test to enrol at Allsworth, as leave to relocate was premised on parties agreeing on R’s school and access arrangements. By this time, more than two weeks had passed since the Court of Appeal denied the Father leave to appeal. (For completeness, I point out that I not read JC Tan’s order for relocation as being conditional on the choice of school having been finalised, but nothing turns on this).

16     On 16 May 2019, the Mother’s solicitors wrote to the Court seeking an urgent case conference as Allsworth would be commencing its school term in the first week of September 2019 and there was no agreement on R’s choice of school. The Mother was concerned that the Father was seeking to defeat JC Tan’s order to relocate to London.

17     On 29 May 2019, pursuant to the Mother’s request for a case conference, the Father wrote to the Court categorically denying attempting to stymie the relocation and expressed his preliminary concerns that Allsworth would not serve R’s best interests as it appeared to be of the same, inferior ilk, as another school the Mother had also proposed in her relocation application.

18     At a case conference on 31 May 2019, the Father sought time to engage a consultant and come back with his proposals. I directed parties to file their respective affidavits to address specified areas of concern / queries of the Court.

## Parties’ positions at the hearing

19     Counsel for the Father, Mr Ivan Cheong, urged this Court to consider that under the UK education system, R would soon be progressing from a _preparatory_ school to a _senior_ school. This would entail R sitting for senior school entrance examinations in January 2020, so that he could commence senior school in September 2020.

20     There were two main prongs to the Father’s case: (i) when R should be introduced into the UK education system and (ii) which schools – both preparatory and senior ones – would be in R’s best interests to enrol in.

21     On the first prong, the Father explained that the educational consultants he had engaged had advised that it would be unusual and possibly challenging for R to transit to another school from August 2019 onwards. This was because under the UK education system, the UK equivalent of his current grade/standard at SIS was the last year before students enter senior school in the UK. Entry into senior school entailed sitting for entrance examinations at the start of the calendar year that a student turns 11 years old.

22     What all this meant was that if R, who turns 11 in July 2020, was to commence at Allsworth in September 2019, he would have to sit for his senior school entrance examinations by January 2020, so that he could enrol in senior school by September 2020.

23     The Father raised concerns that R would be transferring out of SIS at an unusual juncture, given that this would be the last year before senior school. This, he suggested, would add further stress to the relocation. He was also concerned that R would find it difficult integrating into a new school when he was entering it in the last year, where strong bonds would have already been forged between his peers.

24     In view of the above, the Father made two proposals. Option 1 was for R to remain in Singapore at SIS and to sit for his senior school entrance examinations in Singapore. After all, R was thriving at SIS. The Father suggested he could engage his educational consultants to tutor R in Singapore as they had a Singapore office and wealth of experience in helping students secure a placement in UK senior schools. Thereafter R could commence senior school education in September 2020 in the UK.

25     Option 2 was for R to secure a place in an appropriate London _preparatory_ school of the Father’s own choosing (he did not regard Allsworth as being appropriate). Only then, should R relocate, and thereafter, sit for his senior school entrance examinations. However, securing a placement in such preparatory schools required an assessment and at the time of filing his affidavit, the Father noted that all the preparatory schools were closed. Coupled with the “enormous demand for private school places in London”, the Father’s view was that securing a Year 6 place in a “good prep school in London at this juncture will be an uphill task.”

26     Option 1 was the Father’s preferred option as it would be less destabilising and avoided the uncertainty under Option 2 as to whether R could secure a place at the Father’s chosen London preparatory schools. But if the Court was minded to go with Option 2, then the Father also had a list of three proposed preparatory schools.

27     Under both proposals, the Father acknowledged there would be a delay in the relocation. However, he emphasised he was not seeking to stymie the relocation and was simply acting in R’s best interests. In particular, he wanted to alleviate R’s stress from the relocation.

28     Mr Cheong submitted that given parties’ history of litigation, it was highly unlikely that they would be able to agree on R’s senior school. It would thus be in R’s best interests for the Court to also decide on R’s senior school rather than litigate the issue. The Father thus proposed a list of three senior schools for the Court’s consideration.

29     Supporting his view that his schools were superior to Allsworth, the Father produced a dossier of reports and glossy brochures boasting of the sterling reputation and high educational standards of his proposed schools, as well as a report from his consultant comparing Allsworth somewhat unfavourably to his preparatory schools.

30     Mr Yap Teong Liang, counsel for the Mother, objected to the issue of R’s senior school being decided as it was not before the Court. Rather, it was something that parties had to work out in due course. The relocation had been delayed for a long time, and the Father’s proposals now were simply attempts to frustrate the relocation.

31     Further, R had since passed the assessment for enrolment at Allsworth. Mr Yap submitted that it was in R’s best interests to commence there as soon as possible, since the school term was commencing soon. In contrast, under both the Father’s proposals, R would have to be subjected to the necessary assessments for entry and the relocation would be delayed.

32     Besides, between 5 March 2019 and 31 May 2019 when parties started corresponding on the matter, the Father did not provide alternative schools to Allsworth. Although the Father explained this was because he did not think it worthwhile to engage educational consultants until he had exhausted his avenues of appeal, the Mother was highly cynical of this explanation. Mr Yap iterated that the Father’s objections were simply to defeat the relocation order, nothing more. After all, even after the Court of Appeal denied leave to appeal on 12 April 2019, some two weeks on, the Father was still objecting to Allsworth without proposing alternative schools.

33     Mr Yap also pointed out that the Mother’s choice of Allsworth was not controversial given that in allowing the Mother’s appeal, the learned Tan JC had observed that there was no evidence that another preparatory school initially proposed by the Mother in the relocation application was not appropriate for R. For context, Allsworth had been raised as an alternative to the said preparatory school to address the Father’s objections to the latter. Having been vindicated of her earlier choice, there was no reason for the Father to now object to Allsworth on similar grounds. But Mr Cheong countered that it was for the Mother to demonstrate how Allsworth was in R’s best interests and not simply assert that it was not a bad school.

## The respective attributes of parties’ chosen schools

34     In arriving at their choice of schools, both parents took the same view that an all-rounded, holistic education was important. It was regrettably ironic that they _simply_ differed on how to achieve that goal.

35     According to the Father, parties had little opportunity to discuss R’s choice of school in London. Nonetheless, when parties decided to enrol R in SIS years ago, they had agreed that (a) R was best served by a large school with a full range of facilities and amenities; (b) R would grow up as a better individual “in the round” (_i.e._ exposure to sports, language, culture and arts are all important) and not just focus on excelling in academics); (c) R’s Eurasian heritage needed to be fully supported; (d) co-education was critical and (e) the International Baccalaureate (“IB programme”) should be followed. There was no explanation however on how parties had allegedly arrived at these criteria.

36     Consequently, the Father urged the Court to rely on SIS as a benchmark as R was accustomed to such an environment. In his words, R “has only ever known a large full curricula school with extensive facilities and amenities such as \[SIS\].” As far as the Father was concerned, being in a familiar environment would minimise disruption and the sense of change for R, and also provide him with the full range of educational opportunities he enjoyed at SIS. It was also important that R’s school could provide him with an outdoor environment for play and sports.

37     As mentioned earlier, the Father produced various reports and brochures of his preparatory and senior schools to persuade this Court that his chosen schools were superior to Allsworth, and which senior school would be best suited for R.

38     The Father’s preparatory schools were undeniably superior to Allsworth in terms of their facilities. The notable features of these schools were their sheer size, one of them being 52 acres in size and in the countryside; astro turf pitches; swimming pools and multi-million dollar developments and refurbishments. These schools also excelled academically. I do not propose to dwell at length on the respective schools’ attributes – the Court is not the regulator – suffice to say that on paper at least, it would require a stretch of imagination to consider any of these schools as being substandard in any way.

39     As for Allsworth, the Father stated that it was his opinion, as well as those he had consulted, that Allsworth was “at the bottom end of any school option”. He took issue with it for being made up of internal rooms, and found it to be lacking any courtyard or external play area, and in a “very average condition”.

40     Academics-wise, it perturbed the Father that Allsworth did not use the national curriculum to determine attainment as it was privately run. Crucially, he noted that Allsworth did not offer the IB programme unlike SIS. This in his view, would prejudice R should he eventually return to Singapore; it also meant that his quality of education would suffer as opposed to being in a school offering the IB programme. Overall, R’s academic and developmental achievements would not be of the same quality as schools applying the national curriculum or IB benchmarks. He found it unfathomable that the Mother being highly educated herself would not want the same for R.

41     Allsworth’s small student population of 340 students was also troubling as the Father understood to R to thrive in a learning environment where there was a larger student size, wider range of subjects and higher quality teaching. He also cited the diverse student profile as a concern (for example 10% of them having special needs), suggesting that the school would be unlikely to group the children according to their individual learning abilities.

42     Further, there was likely a high degree of transience in relation to the student population since most of the children at Allsworth were progeny of “businesspeople, diplomats, dignitaries or expatriates on short-term secondment”. The Father highlighted that it could be distressing to R if his classmates were to change frequently.

43     Location-wise, the Father pointed out that Allsworth was located in a heavily polluted part of London. This could only hurt R’s health should he undertake any sports activities which would naturally be limited because of the poor air quality.

44     Also, the Father claimed R had told him he did not like Allsworth as it was “dirty and disorganised”; that Allsworth had “no facilities”; its library was limited to two shelves and very dark, and that R was concerned that rather than play in open spaces as in SIS, the children at Allsworth played in the hallways of the school during recess.

45     In sum, as far the Father was concerned, the only conceivable reason for the Mother choosing Allsworth was proximity to her workplace and she clearly did not have R’s best interests at heart.

46     Defending her choice of Allsworth, the Mother stated she believed that Allsworth had a “nice balance of academic excellence arts and sports \[which\] would suit R as he is a good student but enjoys his music and arts”.

47     In staying with her choice of Allsworth, the Mother explained that it was recommended by an education consultant who was in turn recommended by a trusted colleague who personally knew the consultant’s founder. It was recommended to her on the basis that it was a good school in London, and would be a small campus where R would be one of the older students, and not simply just one of many students.

48     The Mother believed these factors would help R settle in and importantly, according to her, take into account R’s “regular feedback that he did not like some of the older children” in SIS, but enjoyed being the older student for the younger students at SIS.

49     As a small diverse campus, Allsworth had a low student to teacher ratio which would help him acclimatise to his new environment and routine. It also had a good balance of academic excellence, arts and sports which was suited for R who enjoyed all these activities. She believed that being located in central London, they would have plenty of options on soccer clubs and after school extra curricular activities. On top of this, Allsworth boasted a good track record of its students moving on to good senior schools.

50     She had also visited Allsworth herself, and the Mother found it to be well-run having friendly staff; its facilities were warm and welcoming, and the Mother was impressed with the school. She even found it friendlier than SIS.

51     R himself had also visited Allsworth in June and according to the Mother, was delighted that he could study Geography and History as part of his curriculum after speaking to the teachers there.

52     Reinforcing the Mother’s assessment of the school was the ISIR which revealed the school to be assessed as “excellent” in the realm of “academic and other achievements” and “personal development.” It also revealed that the students there had been offered scholarships to various prestigious senior schools.

## My decision on R’s London school (HCF/DCA 97/2019)

53     It was inevitable perhaps that the availability and ready accessibility of reports and brochures of the various schools meant they would be presented to this Court to persuade it as to which school be better for R. However, with respect, the materials had the effect of reducing the exercise to something more akin to judging a beauty pageant, than a holistic inquiry into what would best serve R’s best interests. They were not unhelpful, but neither did they illuminate the query on what would truly be in R’s best interests.

54     In _UXH v UXI_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHCF 24</span>, the Honourable Debbie Ong J (“Ong J”) remarked at \[28\] of her grounds of decision that parents are the most suitable persons to make decisions and bear responsibility for their child:

> … _Barring exceptional circumstances where a parent is unfit, parents know their child best and are the most suitable persons to make decisions and bear responsibility for their child._ Parenting decisions, even those made after a divorce, should be made by the parents themselves. When parents are unable to reach an agreed arrangement despite their best efforts and they seek the court’s intervention as the last resort, _the court will consider all the circumstances to determine what is in the child’s welfare_, **_but this does not change the reality that the court is not the child’s parent_****.**

\[own emphasis\]

55     Indeed, Ong J’s exhortation for parents to simply behave as parents should, is envisaged in section 46 of the Women’s Charter:

> 46\. — (1)    Upon the solemnization of marriage, the husband and the wife shall be mutually bound to co-operate with each other in safeguarding the interests of the union and in caring and providing for the children.

Notwithstanding the reference to “marriage” in the aforesaid section, I would venture that parties’ unmarried status in the sense of never having been married (as opposed to being no longer married) does not detract from their parental responsibility. At \[28\] of _AZZ v BAA_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 44</span>, the High Court observed that while section 46 is framed as a responsibility that spouses owe towards each other, it is also a responsibility parents owe towards their child and society at large. And as the learned Ong J noted at \[16\] of _VET v VEU_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHCF 4</span>, “… the parental responsibility to safeguard the welfare of children is not dependent on the married or unmarried status of her parents.”

56     This solemn responsibility and imperative to safeguard a child’s welfare in my view, is not confined to “high stake” matters such as whether a child ought to be relocated. It encompasses every aspect of the child’s life because, as Ong J noted at \[14\] of the same judgment:

> A child’s welfare refers to her well-being in every aspect, that is, her well-being in the most exhaustive sense of that word. It refers to her physical, intellectual, psychological, emotional, moral and religious well-being. It refers to her well-being both in the short term and in the long term: _UKM v Attorney-General_ at \[45\]; _TSF v TSE_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 2 SLR 833</span> at \[51\] and \[52\]. Also relevant to a child’s welfare is the need to enable parents to carry out their parental responsibility without unnecessary interference from third parties: _UMF v UMG_ at \[28\] and \[33\].

57     As the care and control parent, it is not surprising and to be expected, that the Mother would be more familiar with R’s needs. As the High Court noted at \[67\] of _AZZ v BAA_, in granting the wife in that case care and control:

> … this will inevitably endow the wife with substantially greater insight than the husband can ever have about each child’s ever-evolving needs and wants, hopes and fears. That insight will place the wife in a far better position than him to know what will best promote the children’s welfare at any point in time, both in the short-term and for the long-term.

58     In this regard, her considerations of R’s claimed preference of being in a smaller school where he could be one of the bigger boys as she put it, addressed a socio-developmental need that was unique to R in his present circumstances. It was also consistent with the intimate knowledge a care and control parent typically has of a child’s needs.

59     Whereas the Father’s understanding of R’s needs appeared to revolve around and focus primarily on the physical as seen from his emphasis on sprawling, outdoor facilities. Certainly there was nothing wrong with this, but while physical and sporting activities were certainly important for R, his emotional and psycho-social needs were also important.

60     In this regard, R was already 10 at the time of the hearing and at this intermediate age between childhood and adolescence, colloquially referred to as the “tweens” is a challenging period where children are coming into their own, developing a sense of self and also transition when they undergo puberty. Being a “big fish in a small pond” then, would be beneficial to R who allegedly did not enjoy just being one of many students in SIS. This clearly was something that impacted his self-confidence and Allsworth appeared to be a school that could help promote this more due to its “friendly” and “warm” environment.

61     While the Father claimed that R thrived in a large environment, it was unclear how he had arrived at this understanding, or how parties had determined the criteria when R first enrolled at SIS.

62     In any event, such criteria may no longer be relevant given the evolving needs of R. Being in a large school full of strangers – the Father’s proposed schools had 500-700 students – might actually be deleterious rather than salubrious at this point in R’s life. A bigger student population did not necessarily translate into one making more friends.

63     As for the Father’s claims that R said he disliked Allsworth for being inadequate in its facilities and dirty, it was at best, a neutral factor even if true. Whilst R allegedly expressed his dislike for Allsworth, the context in which this was said was unknown. R could have been simply criticising the school because it was less impressive looking than SIS, nothing more, or he could have simply made those remarks because he believed that would please the Father.

64     After all, the Father’s evidence was not that R expressed objection to attending Allsworth, or that R had expressed a desire to attend another school. Further, the Father did not attest to having suggested alternative schools to R.

65     It thus did not appear to be the Father’s case that R himself thought Allsworth was not suitable. But even if that were his case, it would a very rare instance where a child is allowed to dictate important decisions such as his choice of school. The law believes them to be unable to make decisions in their own best interests – that truly is the preserve of parents until they turn 21 under the Women’s Charter. To the extent that parents desire to take into account their children’s preferences, that is an exercise of parental wisdom. But R’s purported disdain for Allsworth could not in of itself mean that it was not in his best interests to study there.

66     At this juncture, I would just briefly address the Father’s various objections to Allsworth. The fact that the school did not use the national attainment standard did not appear to impinge upon the academic performance of its students. The ISIR which was published by a body under the aegis of the Department of Education, had glowing reviews of the students who were articulate and assessed the school as being “excellent” in the realm of “academic and other achievements” and “personal development.” Its students made “strong academic progress”, owing to the school’s “excellent tracking and systematic monitoring, well-focused intervention and remedial action when required”.

67     As for the fact that it did not offer the IB programme, I did consider if this very fact would be disruptive to R’s learning. I accept there may be indeed be some disruption and adjustment required. That said, the IB is well-known to be framed on a teaching and learning philosophy. The IB would have placed him in good stead anywhere in terms of his learning approach. Any disruption was in my view highly unlikely to be prejudicial to R’s learning. Further, there was nothing to suggest that R’s learning would suffer if he could not continue the IB at Allsworth. After all, the Father had also described R as being “moderately bright” and I did not think that this would cause R prejudice.

68     As for the high degree of transience suggested by the Father, this was somewhat speculative but even if true, being in SIS, R himself would have encountered such transience as it was an international school. He would also be well aware that he would be moving on to senior school in about a year’s time, so there was hardly any permanence to his circumstances in any event.

69     As for Allsworth’s location, I agree it did not enjoy the purest air quality where it was. However, there was nothing to suggest it impacted students’ abilities to participate in sports or their health, and indeed, the ISIR did not reveal this to be so. Further, as the Father himself pointed out, there were measures to regulate emissions in the vicinity.

70     In _BNS v BNT_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGCA 33</span>, the Court of Appeal observed at \[22\] of its judgment: “There can be no pre-fixed precedence or hierarchy among the many composite factors which may inform the court’s decision as to where the child’s best interests ultimately lie: where these factors stand in relation to one another must depend in the final analysis, on a consideration of _all the facts of the case_”. \[own emphasis\]

71     Considering all the facts of a case, and that a child’s welfare is to be considered in the most “exhaustive sense”, it would be remiss to ignore the genesis of this set of litigation proceedings and how it has impacted R.

72     From the time the Mother applied for relocation in July 2017 to date, R would have experienced emotional, psychological, social upheavals. When the tussle for R to remain or relocate began in July 2017, he was merely 8 years old. He has always been well-loved by his parents, and clearly loves them both. One can only imagine the conflicting emotions he experienced from the relocation being denied in November 2017, to it being allowed in December 2018, and then at risk of it being derailed in early 2019, until the Court of Appeal denied leave for the Father to appeal to it.

73     Uncertainty over his life as he knows it, has thus dogged R for more than two years. There was a need for finality as to where he would be living and studying.

74     I recognise that parties believe they are both acting in R’s best interests. However, the Father’s proposal under option 2 required R to sit for further assessments, thereby creating further uncertainty. As the Father himself acknowledged, there was no guarantee that R could indeed secure a place in any of his shortlisted preparatory schools. Going with the Father’s proposals under option 2 would mean R giving up his place at Allsworth, only to take a gamble on securing a place at one of his prestigious shortlisted schools. Should R fail the entrance examinations for these schools, there was no evidence that Allsworth would re-offer him a place.

75     I thus found that enrolling in Allsworth as soon as possible would be in R’s best interests. I am not saying that it is a superior school to the Father’s but in _all_ the circumstances, I found it only desirable that R begins this new chapter in his life sooner rather than later, and at Allsworth.

76     Up to this point, I have explained my reasons for why I rejected the Father’s proposed preparatory schools under option 2. I acknowledge that there was intuitive appeal to the contention that it would be ideal for R to continue for the time being in SIS, and thereafter sit for the entrance examinations in Singapore because of the continuity and stability it provided (option 1).

77     However, not only did this appear to thwart the relocation order by delaying it, it would also likely subject R to an unnecessary battery of assessment tests since the parties had no agreement on R’s future senior school. The Father’s indication that he would get his consultants in to tutor R also suggested that there may be a battle to steer R towards the Father’s choice of senior schools.

78     It appeared to me that option 1 (as with option 2) placed R squarely in the middle of his parents’ conflict. His circumstances might lead him to believe rightly or wrongly, that his performance in such assessments may be construed as to which parent he was aligning, even allying, himself with. The conflicting loyalties a child experiences comes into sharper relief when the child loves both parents dearly and he knows they both love him too. If the Father thought the stakes were high in such assessment tests, the emotional stakes might even be higher in R’s eyes, for his performance may be read as an indication of which parent he preferred and give pause to wonder whether there may be “reprisals”? Balancing the benefit of continuity and stability of remaining at SIS, against the burden of expectations R would suffer if he remained at SIS to sit for the senior school examinations, I found that R’s best interests lay in obviating the latter.

79     Mr Cheong submitted that not deciding on the issue of R’s senior school now was tantamount to kicking the can down the road. Time may prove him right. However, in proposing his list of senior schools, the Mother had not had the opportunity to give her input on the matter. Indeed, at the case conference in May 2019, there was no hint at the Father wishing to address the Court on the issue of senior schools, nor was this an issue I had directed parties to address the Court on.

80     The Father thus wanted to avoid litigation, but on his terms. Yet the issue of senior school is to be decided between the parties as R’s parents. As much as the Father may believe that they will wind up in Court again, I did not think the Court ought to pre-empt litigation and in so doing, then usurp the privilege and responsibility of the parents to decide on their son’s future.

81     Besides, the choice of senior school may well entail different considerations from the choice of preparatory school because of R’s interests or abilities. Because parents know their children best, I found that R’s senior school has to be decided by parties. Litigation ought to always be the last resort and I add, only after parents having acted in good faith and not cynically, have exhausted all attempts to resolve the matters(s) between themselves.

## The Father’s access to R whilst in London (HCF/DCA 160/2019)

82     In sum, the Father’s case was that he should enjoy the lion share of most of R’s holidays since he had to fly to London to see R. After all, the Mother would get to see R all the time as the care and control parent.

83     Mr Yap submitted the Mother ought not to be prejudiced against having her fair share of the holidays simply because she was the care and control parent. She was after all working full-time; it was not as if she spent 24 hours with R.

84     The Mother’s proposals were for the Father and her to share the summer holidays equally, with additional access during school holidays as follows: (a) one week during the October school holidays; (b) one week during the February school holidays and (c) two weeks during the pril school holidays.

85     Further, should the Father travel to London during the school term, she would facilitate access subject to two weeks’ prior notice being given and subject to R’s school schedule.

86     Remote access over Skype, Facetime _etcetera_ could be scheduled around R’s timetable and the time difference between London and New Zealand.

87     The Mother also offered to fly from London to Singapore for the Father to pick R from Singapore and drop off in Singapore for up to three of the five holiday access periods, if the Father provided at least 4 weeks’ prior notice.

88     The Father categorised his holidays into long, medium and short holidays. His proposal was that for the long holidays of 8 weeks, he would have access for the first 6 weeks in odd years commencing 2021, and the last 6 weeks of even years commencing 2020. He would provide the Mother with 6 weeks’ written notice.

89     I ordered instead that the Father commence his access starting 2020 instead, with the first 6 weeks of the long holidays allotted to him, and the remaining two weeks to the Mother. In 2021, it would be the Mother’s turn to have 6 weeks of the long holidays. Should the Father wish to travel overseas with R, he was to inform the Mother at least 12 days beforehand. All other terms of the Father’s proposal remain unchanged.

90     The rationale for my orders was to ensure that both parents had the opportunity to bond and travel with R over the long holidays. While I accepted that the Father saw less of R than the Mother, it could not mean that he was thus automatically entitled to “monopolise” R during the long holidays. This would deprive the Mother of being able to plan long overseas travels with R, which would be unjust given that she is after all the parent with care and control.

91     For the medium holidays, _i.e._ those holidays which spanned three to three and a half weeks, the Father proposed to have access for the full duration of such holidays. He would provide R with opportunities to travel to New Zealand or other destinations and would provide the Mother with at least 6 weeks’ written notice.

92     Again, I found this to be much too skewed in his favour to the prejudice of the Mother. I ordered instead that the Father have two weeks of the medium holidays in the years that he had 6 weeks of the long holidays. In years where he had two weeks of the long holidays, he could have the full duration of the medium holidays. All other terms of the Father’s proposal remain unchanged. These orders were intended to strike some parity in parties’ apportionment of the long and medium holidays each year.

93     For the short holidays of one week, the Father proposed having full duration of such holidays and he would provide the Mother with one month’s notice. He would be at liberty to bring R overseas taking into account R’s flights, period of adjustment before he resumes school. I found this to be reasonable and ordered as such.

94     Other orders sought by the Father related to handover arrangements and additional access apart from the school holidays, such as overseas access and overnight access. These I found to be largely reasonable and I ordered as such, save that for the overseas access, I tweaked the period of prior notice of the itinerary and flight details and other attendant information from 10 days to 12 days.

95     For the overnight access, the Father had also requested for reasonable and consecutive, repeated overnight access, and for him to give 10 days’ prior notice of his intention to exercise such access. There was no time period stipulated for such overnight access. As such, Mr Yap voiced concerns over how such access might interfere with R’s schooling.

96     I thus ordered that for access outside the school holidays, the Father shall have reasonable access to R, including consecutive and repeated overnight access in the event that the Father visits London. This is subject to: (i) the Father furnishing 12 days’ notice to the Mother of his intended visit; (ii) the Father’s intended visit not interfering with the timings of R’s schooling, enrichment and extra-curricular activities or the Mother’s access to Ryan over the long and medium school holidays (unless the Mother gives her written consent); (iii) any consecutive overnight access is not to exceed 7 nights at a go, and (iv) non-consecutive overnight access is not to exceed 7 nights over a two-week period.

97     The rationale for the overnight access not exceeding 7 nights at a go was simply because of the potential disruption to R’s nightly routine as such access would be during term time. Further, without any proposed “cap” by the Father on how frequently he would be exercising such access, it made sense that the orders had an in-built limitation on the duration of such access. Otherwise, such access could in theory, take place every other week if the Father so desired.

98     As for remote access, the Father proposed liberal access and for the Mother to ensure that R would always have unrestricted access to his mobile phone for Father and son to contact each other directly. He added that the Mother should not obstruct or impose restrictions on R’s use of the phone unless agreed in writing by the Father.

99     My final orders were largely along the lines of the Father’s proposals but it was somewhat onerous to require the Mother to ensure that R always had unrestricted access to the Father and _vice versa_. I ordered instead that the Father shall have liberal phone and Skype access and the Mother shall not obstruct or impose restriction on such access, unless there are reasonable grounds for imposing such restrictions, which must be set out in writing to the Father’s solicitors. The Mother was to propose make up access timings where phone and Skype access has been unable to take place. I left it to parties to work out the timings between themselves as obviously, such timing would be dynamic and fluid depending on their respective schedules and the time difference.

100    At the end of the day, the purpose of access is for the parent not having care and control to keep regular contact with their child ( \[11\] of _BG v BF_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 3 SLR(R) 233</span>). The access orders made in my view, gave the Father ample and regular contact for a parent who was not even resident in the same jurisdiction as his child.

## Conclusion

101    R deserved to move on from this litigation. The Father’s proposals for his education moving forward, had the effect of delaying the relocation and subjected R to greater uncertainty and unnecessary burden. In particular, the issue of senior school should be something that parties discuss and decide upon considering all the circumstances at the relevant point in time. The touchstone is always R’s best interests which I recognise, is not immutable. At this juncture, R’s need for security and to boost his self-confidence appeared to be better served at Allsworth and it was significant that the Mother’s decision-making process considered such a need that went beyond the mere physical needs of extensive facilities.

102    The inquiry as to what is in R’s best interests may yield a different answer at a different phase in his life. But I would like to believe that what is unchanging and constant is his love for his parents and their love for him. To that end, the parents should cease ensnaring R in their litigation. As the High Court observed at \[70\] of _AZZ v BAA_:

> …It is inconceivable to me that two parents could ever be content to let a stranger make an important long-term decision for their child rather than to work out a solution for themselves. That stranger, no matter how skilled in the law or conscientious in its application, cannot decide for a child as parents can. In any event, it is not the court’s function to be, in effect, the children’s third parent.

103    I pause to add that the Father aggrieved by my decision, may believe that to begin with, the Mother had unilaterally arranged for R to sit for the entrance test for Allsworth and in so doing, had obtained a strategic advantage in the litigation.

104    I agree that the Mother should have been more transparent with the Father on her plans when arrangements were made in February 2019 for R to sit for the Allsworth assessment. In the same vein that she defended her actions by referring to JC Tan having already ordered the relocation, she should also be alive to the fact that he had ordered for parties to discuss the issue of R’s school as well. To refer to Allsworth having been mentioned in her relocation application two years ago and the Father thus having constructive notice misses the point that both parents are to be involved in the decision making process, and any preparatory step, no matter how nascent, is to be communicated clearly. Acrimony is no excuse for the lack of communication especially since parties have always communicated through their solicitors, whom they can well afford. I urge them to consider whether as R’s parents, they too can afford the emotional and psychological costs of R being a constant subject of litigation.
