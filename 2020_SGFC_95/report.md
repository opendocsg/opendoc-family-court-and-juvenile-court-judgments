Family law – Pleadings – Striking Out

12 November 2020

### District Judge Chia Wee Kiat:

## Background

1       The Plaintiff shall be referred to as the “Wife” and the Defendant shall be referred to as the “Husband”. The parties were married in 1987. They have a child who is now an adult.

2       After 32 years of marriage, the Wife commenced the current divorce proceedings on the ground of the Husband’s behaviour. On 20 July 2020, the Husband filed FC/SUM 1942/2020 (“SUM 1942”), an application to strike out paragraphs 5 to 22 of the Wife’s Statement of Particulars (“SOP”). According to the Husband, these particulars had nothing to do with why the marriage had broken down and disclose no reasonable cause of action for the divorce.[^1]

3       This application was made pursuant to Rule 405 of the Family Justice Rules which provides as follows:

> The Court may at any stage of the proceedings order to be struck out or amended any pleading or the endorsement of any writ in the action, or anything in any pleading or in the endorsement, on the ground that –

>> (a)    it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence, as the case may be;

>> (b)    it is scandalous, frivolous or vexations;

>> (c)    it may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action; or

>> (d)    it is otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court.

4       The Husband asserts that this was an attempt by the Wife to validate her alleged indirect contributions to the marriage, which should only be dealt with at the ancillary stage and not at the divorce trial.[^2]

5       SUM 1942 was dismissed by the learned Assistant Registrar Sarah Chua (“the AR”) on 24 July 2020 with costs fixed at $600 to the Wife. In dismissing the application, the AR said as follows:

> I do not see that paragraphs 5 to 22 SOP are entirely irrelevant to the issue of UB. There are grounds to say that they significantly accentuate the unreasonableness of the Defendant’s behaviour. In terms of the threshold for striking out, it is not satisfied. DC’s application to strike out paras 5 to 22 is dismissed.[^3]

6       The Husband appealed against the AR’s decision. The Husband’s appeal, FC/RA 5/2020 (“RA 5”), came up for hearing before me on 3 September 2020. On 21 September 2020, I dismissed the appeal and provided brief oral grounds. As the Husband has appealed against my decision, I now set out my grounds of decision.

## The Husband’s position

7       In the main, the Husband’s position is that the AR had failed to appreciate the function of pleadings and that only material facts ought to be pleaded. The Husband submits that paragraphs 5 to 22 of the SOP do not contain any material facts of his alleged unreasonable behaviour, and at its highest, only contained subordinate facts. The Husband contends that subordinate facts, which are not entirely irrelevant to the issues before the court, should not be pleaded.[^4]

8       The Husband further contends that the AR failed to examine each individual paragraph to determine if there were any material facts pleaded and what exactly was the alleged unreasonable behaviour that was significantly accentuated by these paragraphs.[^5] The Husband submits that there was no necessity for these pleadings to remain as the other portions of the pleadings (in particular \[24\]-\[26\] of the SOP) could already be reasonably construed as unreasonable behaviour.[^6]

9       The Husband submits that paragraphs 5 to 22 of the SOP must be struck out as they disclose no reasonable cause of action, are not material facts to the issue before the Court and that the pleadings are vexatious and frivolous.[^7]

## The Wife’s position

10     The Wife contends that paragraphs 5 to 22 set out the bedrock of the parties’ marriage.[^8] According to the Wife, all of this is especially significant given that it is the Wife’s case that the Wife and the Husband had built up a business together, with her rolling up her sleeves and contributing in both resources and efforts, but the Husband has behaved in a way that not only does not recognise and acknowledge the Wife’s due, but that has deteriorated over time to such an extent as to be intolerable to the Wife particularly in the context of how the parties had built up a long marriage together over a span of 3 decades.[^9]

11     The Wife points out that one of the reasons for the irretrievable breakdown of the parties’ marriage is the Husband’s attitude and behaviour towards her despite her efforts and devotion to him and their business throughout the years.[^10] The Wife contends that paragraphs 5 to 22 of the SOP are both relevant and necessary to appreciate the extent of the Wife’s hard work and contributions, and both lay the context and stand in sharp contrast to the Husband’s conduct towards her.[^11] The Wife points out that paragraphs 4 and 23 (in addition to paragraphs 5 to 22) of the SOP similarly set out the Wife’s case in relation to the parties’ joint efforts towards the marriage but the Husband did not seek to strike out these paragraphs. [^12]

## Analysis

12     As a start, it is worth reiterating the trite principle of law that a judge hearing a Registrar’s Appeal exercises confirmatory jurisdiction, not appellate jurisdiction. This is clear from _Lian Soon Construction Pte Ltd v Guan Qian Realty Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 1 SLR(R) 1053</span> at \[38\] where it was held that:

> … A judge in chambers who hears an appeal from the Registrar is entitled to treat the matter as though it came before him for the first time. The judge in chambers in effect exercises confirmatory jurisdiction. The judge’s discretion is in no way fettered by the decision below …

13     SUM 1942, from which the present appeal arose, concerns the striking out of pleadings. As noted by the High Court in _Nirumalan K Pillay and others v A Balakrishnan and others_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] SGHC 157</span> (at \[9\]):

> The court has wide coercive and corrective powers to ensure that parties adhere to the well-settled and substantive and formal rules of pleading. In proper cases the court may even strike out defective pleadings…

14     The power to strike out is derived from Rule 405 and the inherent powers of the Court to “make any order as may be necessary to prevent injustice or to prevent an abuse of the process of the Court” (Rule 985) : see commentary in _Singapore Court Practice 2017_ (Jeffrey Pinsler gen ed) (LexisNexis, 2017) at \[18/19/1\] on the equivalent rules in the Rules of Court.

15     The fundamental rule, as set out in Rule 393, is that every pleading must contain only a statement in a summary form of the material facts on which the party pleading relies for his claim or defence but not the evidence by which those facts are to be proved, and the statement must be as brief as the nature of the case admits.

16     It is common ground between the parties that the test for striking out, in the context of a claim based on behaviour, is that set out in _Chen Stella Yfantidis v Chen Yu Hian Christopher_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGDC 35</span> (“_Chen Stella_”).[^13] In particular, paragraph 23(7) states as follows:

> In the context of unreasonable behaviour particulars:

>> 1.    The test for striking out particulars is whether (1) after the striking out, the remaining particulars could be reasonably construed as constituting an allegation of unreasonable behaviour; or (2) whether the particulars significantly accentuate the unreasonableness of the behaviour set out in certain other particulars.

>> 2.    The personality and behaviour of the petitioner may be a material fact if it is necessary to view the respondent’s behaviour in the light of the petitioner’s behaviour and personality in order to construe it as unreasonable, or in order to significantly accentuate its unreasonableness.

>> 3.    Each type of unreasonable behaviour would constitute a material fact, and must be pleaded. In addition, if a particular type of unreasonable behaviour is pleaded, then the date and time and a brief nature of each incident of that type of unreasonable behaviour would be material facts. This is however subject to the principle of moderation set out in paragraph 15 above.

17     It is the Wife’s case that the marriage has broken down irretrievably under s 95 (3)(b) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353) in that the Husband has behaved in such a way that the Wife cannot reasonably be expected to live with the Husband.[^14]

18     The Wife’s SOP contains a total of 52 paragraphs. The Husband contends that paragraphs 5 to 22 of the SOP are not material facts and the majority of the particulars are about the Wife’s contributions which should be dealt with at the Ancillary Matters (“AM”) hearing.[^15]

19     As reference has been made to paragraphs 4 to 26 of the SOP, it would be convenient at this stage to set these out:

> STATEMENT OF PARTICULARS

> 1    …

> 4    The Parties have been married for some 32 years. However, the Defendant has increasingly been conducting himself in such a manner that the Plaintiff has since concluded that she can no longer continue with the marriage.

>> a.    Although the Parties worked together for many years to build up a business empire, including \[_redacted_\], a successful business listed on the Singapore Exchange, the Defendant has thoroughly belittled the Plaintiff’s work and efforts, and has consistently failed to give the Plaintiff her due.

>> b.    The Defendant’s unreasonable behaviour extended to verbal abuse of the Plaintiff, including in front of the staff of \[_redacted_\], to such an extent that the Plaintiff has been diagnosed with clinical depression for which she has had to consult psychiatrists and take psychiatric medication.

>> c.    The Plaintiff has also been led to believe that the Defendant has been involved in multiple extra-marital affairs with various women, starting from 2012, if not earlier.

>>> i.    The Plaintiff believes that the Defendant has been in an improper relationship with a younger, married woman, the 1st Co-Defendant, since no later than 2012.

>>> ii.    Despite past promises to the Plaintiff that he would cease this improper relationship, the Plaintiff now realises that the Defendant has not in fact done so, and he has been lying to her for years.

>>> iii.   To the contrary, the Plaintiff believes that the Defendant has in fact expanded his inappropriate associations, and as of 2019 is also concurrently in an improper relationship with another younger woman, the 2nd Co-Defendant.

>>> iv.    The Plaintiff feels hurt, disrespected and betrayed by the Defendant.

> Background: A Marriage and the Building of a Business Empire

> 5    The Parties first commenced their relationship in or around 1984, when the Plaintiff was employed as an army medic by the Singapore Armed Forces at \[redacted\], and the Defendant was serving his National Service also as a medic at the same camp.

> 6    After the Defendant completed his National Service in or around 1985, he worked at his family’s jewellery business, \[_redacted_\]. At the time, this was a single jewellery shop operating out of \[redacted\]. After the Parties got married, the Plaintiff also assisted the Defendant and his parents in running the jewellery shop. The Parties got married and moved into their first matrimonial home at \[_redacted_\], Singapore.

> 7    When the jewellery business expanded to include a newly set-up jewellery factory at \[_redacted_\], the Plaintiff helped the Defendant with the renovation of the factory premises. She also continued to assist generally in the business, not only in retail but also in sourcing and liaising with various goldsmiths for raw gold material. Throughout this time, she also gave personal loans to the business (including via loans to the Defendant) from her own personal savings as and when requested to help alleviate cash-flow issues, which would be repaid to her from the business each time the capital crunch was past.

> 8    The Defendant’s family would also invest in old residential properties, and seek to turn a profit by renovating, refurnishing and then reselling them. Typically, the Defendant would take charge of the renovations, and the Plaintiff would help him on the project. This help extended to manual labour; to save on renovation costs, the Plaintiff would mix cement for the workers, transport soil for the garden and plant grass seedlings, and assist to wash and clean the premises during and after the renovations.

> 9    Although the Parties were helping out with the Defendant’s family business and projects, it was always the Defendant’s dream to start his own business. To this end, the Parties sought to go into property development on their own. As they had insufficient capital, they sold their first matrimonial home, stayed with the Defendant’s parents, and used the sale proceeds to invest in and redevelop their first residential property, a piece of land at \[_redacted_\]. This was in or around June 1992. The venture proved successful, as the Parties managed to sell the newly-built home at a profit a year later, in 1993.

> 10    Buoyed by their success, the Parties went on to redevelop and sell a few more properties in the subsequent years, and earned some further profit. All of these joint profits would be banked into the bank accounts of the Defendant and/or the Defendant’s family business.

> 11    In 1995 the parties bought 3 pieces of land at \[_redacted_\], \[_redacted_\], and \[_redacted_\] with plans to develop small hotels thereon. However, even after completion, the Parties were only able to sell the property at \[_redacted_\], in March 1997. Unable to sell the other 2 hotels, the Parties faced the strain of having to serve the mortgages. Under these tough circumstances, they decided that they would themselves operate these 2 hotels under the names of \[_redacted_\] and \[_redacted_\]. This was around end-1996 or early-1997.

> 12    As this business was still in its infancy, it fell on the Parties to manage all aspects of the business by themselves. Since the Defendant was continuing to manage their ongoing redevelopment projects, the Plaintiff was tasked to manage operations at both hotels. This was also because the Plaintiff was more detail-oriented and quicker to pick up new skills from her previous work experiences. As such, despite having no hotel management experience, the Plaintiff rolled up her sleeves and learnt everything from scratch, including operations, front office, cleaning and guest services, hotel management, and marketing.

>> a.    The Plaintiff had to tap on the specialised IT and accountancy knowledge of her relatives and enlist their help to teach her how to do accounting and use front-office software to operate the hotel business.

>> b.    On the design front, the Plaintiff took charge of designing the hotels’ aesthetic in both interior and exterior design, such as choosing the colours for the facades and designing the hotel lobbies and rooms.

>> c.    On the marketing front, in order to save costs on hiring an external photographer, the Plaintiff would expend much of her own time and effort to use her own camera and take pictures of the hotels’ facades and rooms to be used as marketing materials. To drum up customers, the Plaintiff even designed her own flyers and went to the Clarke Quay and Boat Quay areas with her siblings to distribute the flyers to passers-by on the street.

> 13    By dint of the Plaintiff’s efforts, the hotel business began to do well. The Parties managed to find buyers to buy over these 2 hotels, and the sales took place in or around the 2nd half of 1997.

> 14    Realising that the development and sale of hotel buildings could be more profitable than doing so for simple residential homes, the Parties went on to acquire a few more plots of land around \[_redacted_\] and \[_redacted_\], and obtain government approvals to develop hotels thereon. The market was very bullish at the time, and the Defendant went ahead to purchase \[_redacted_\] even before the hotel at \[_redacted_\] had been completed, with the expectation that \[_redacted_\] would be sold. Unfortunately for the Parties, this coincided with the Asian financial crisis, which reached its peak in around 1998. The market was dismal, and the Parties were unable to complete the sale of the new hotel at \[_redacted_\]. They were highly leveraged and the banks were hounding them for the repayment of the loans. Things were so bad that the Plaintiff even sold her Jaguar car and personal jewellery to pay for family expenses, taxes, and to repay some loans, in a bid to lessen the Parties’ financial burden then.

> 15    In difficult financial straits, the Parties had no choice but to restart their hotel management business in order to continue servicing the mortgages on these latest properties, which became known as \[_redacted_\] and \[_redacted_\]. This was because the Plaintiff did not want to continue using the \[_redacted_\] name, as she felt that it did not sound auspicious due to the \[_redacted_\] in \[_redacted_\].

> 16    This time, the Parties went into hotel management for the long haul. The Plaintiff again set up the operations, including the design of the new \[_redacted_\] logo. Fronting the business, the Plaintiff frequently worked long hours, even standing-in at the front desk or cleaning the guest rooms herself whenever there was a shortage of manpower, even after midnight. Whenever the hotel staff faced IT problems, she would be their first port of call and would often personally go to the hotel at all hours to troubleshoot the problem and liaise with external IT support.

> 17    When the severe acute respiratory syndrome (“SARS”) outbreak occurred in early-2003, the hotel sector was especially affected as tourists stayed away. Throughout this difficult period, the Plaintiff implemented stringent measures in the Parties’ hotels to maintain a high standard of hygiene and cleanliness. Her strong management allowed the business to survive without having to lay off any employees (which was not the case for many players in the hotel industry at the time), and even garnered the \[_redacted_\] the “Cool Singapore Award” from the Singapore Tourism Board and Spring Singapore. This was a certification recognising the stringent precautions and best practices to combat SARS put into place by the hotels.

> 18    Throughout this period, the Plaintiff not only oversaw and managed the hotel operations on a day-to-day basis, but also continued to help the Defendant in building the property development side of the business. For example:

>> a.    She would liaise with the contractors with regard to the defects rectification works, and liaise with the relevant Management Corporations at the developed strata properties;

>> b.    She would also be involved in the interior designing of show flats for these residential projects, tapping on her experience in design from the hotel business; and

>> c.    She also contributed to the marketing efforts by coordinating advertising agencies and translating the English advertisements to be placed on the Chinese newspapers.

> 19    The business continued to prosper, and the Parties’ efforts were further rewarded when the business successfully listed on the Main Board of the Singapore Exchange in \[_redacted_\], as \[_redacted_\]. From listing and to date, the Plaintiff and the Defendant have been directors and shareholders in \[_redacted_\].

> 20    In January 2012, the Plaintiff was tasked to manage the business’ move up from the ‘budget’/economy segment of the market into the premium mid-range hotel segment. This was by way of setting up a hotel known as \[_redacted_\].

> 21    At that time, the project was a critical juncture. The new \[_redacted_\] was due to be open for business in a month’s time. However, the pre-opening progress was far behind schedule. With limited help, the Plaintiff had to work around the clock to hire new staff, craft marketing strategies, handle the procurement process, and secure the operation and equipment supplies. Once again, by virtue of all these efforts, the hotel was eventually able to start operations on time.

> 22    The Parties’ hotel business did so well that it was spun off from the main company (i.e. \[_redacted_\]) in or around April 2012, as a separate company also listed on the Mainboard of the Singapore Exchange, \[_redacted_\]. The company’s success is apparent from the fact that in 2012 it reported a 13.2% increase in revenue from the previous year, with a net profit of S$18.5m. The net proceeds raised from the IPO listing amounted to approximately S$125.3m. At that time, the Plaintiff discussed and advised on the listing options for the hotel business.

> 23    In 2017, the Defendant decided to take \[_redacted_\] private. He completed a compulsory acquisition of \[_redacted_\] using his wholly-owned investment vehicle \[_redacted_\], and \[_redacted_\] was delisted in June 2017.

> Instead of recognition from the Defendant, the Plaintiff suffered abuse

> 24    From the beginning of their relationship, the Defendant had always yearned to be rich and successful, and the Plaintiff had always supported him, rolling up her own sleeves and pitching in with her own time and labour. Even during the difficult periods of financial strain (e.g. the Asian financial crisis in the late-1990s and the SARS epidemic in the early-2000s), the Parties persevered and overcame these difficulties, bringing their business to ever greater heights.

> 25    The Defendant could be a difficult man to live with, especially when it came to issues involving money. Over the years, many of the Parties’ quarrels were due to financial issues. The Defendant was especially difficult to be around when times were difficult for the business often snapping and shouting at the Plaintiff, the Child, and those around him. He would belittle the Plaintiff, complaining and accusing her of not pulling her weight while he was always having to work so hard for the family. The Defendant’s behaviour exacerbated over time.

> 26    Through it all, the Plaintiff had supported him and remained at his side, in the hope that financial success would bring the Parties’ marital happiness. Unfortunately, instead of improving with success, the Defendant’s attitude towards the Plaintiff only worsened. Over the years, it grew increasingly clear to the Plaintiff that the Defendant had allowed the success of their business to go to his ego. Despite the fact that the Plaintiff had been heavily involved in the business, the Defendant views only himself as the sole architect of the Parties’ success.

>> a.    Around 1994, as the Parties’ business was doing well, they decided to use their joint monies to buy some adjoining plots of land at \[_redacted_\], to _inter alia_ build their own new home. Eventually, they split the land into 5 plots, namely, \[_redacted_\], \[_redacted_\], \[_redacted_\], \[_redacted_\] and \[_redacted_\], and built 1 bungalow and 3 semi-detached houses, with the intention that the Parties would own the bungalow, the Defendant’s 3 siblings would each own one of the semi-detached houses, and the last semi-detached house was sold on the market at around $2.21m, while the other semi-detached houses were transferred to the Defendant’s siblings for $1.82m each. The Plaintiff and the Defendant’s siblings later profited from their subsequent sale of these properties. One of the Defendant’s siblings later sold her semi-detached house at around $3.5 - $3.7m. The Defendant suggested that the bungalow be put in his name only to set an example to his sisters, who wanted to include their spouses in the respective titles, and the Plaintiff initially agreed. However, the Defendant’s sisters went ahead and included their spouses’ names anyway, while the Parties’ bungalow was put in the Defendant’s sole name.

>>> i.    When the Plaintiff thereafter asked the Defendant why he did not then include her as a named joint owner of the bungalow, he would evade the issue and avoid giving her an answer, or ger upset and quarrel with the Plaintiff. It became clear to the Plaintiff that the Defendant preferred to keep the bungalow in his sole name.

>>> ii.    During the financial crisis in 1998, the Parties frequently quarrelled. During one such quarrel, the Plaintiff again asked the Defendant why she was not a joint owner of the bungalow that they had bought together. The Defendant’s answer to that was he was concerned that if he pre-deceased the Plaintiff, she would chase his parents out of the house. The Plaintiff was very hurt that the Defendant would think of her in this manner, and also that he appeared not to care about what would happen if instead his parents chased the Plaintiff and their Child out of the house.

>> b.    \[_redacted_\] was listed in \[_redacted_\], with the Parties to hold 75% of the company. The Defendant decided that he would hold 65% of the company, and the Plaintiff would just take 10%. This was a decision unilaterally made by the Defendant, and the Plaintiff was not consulted. She was shocked when she found out, as the Parties had grown the business together from the outset as equal partners, but she viewed the total 75% as their joint share and was prepared to let him, as her husband, enjoy the glory on paper of being the majority and controlling shareholder. However, to the Plaintiff’s disappointment and dismay, not only did the Defendant not reciprocate her sentiments, he instead became more overbearing as a result of the disproportionate split.

>> c.    The Defendant would often tell those around him, such as his bankers, business associates, agents, contractor and other staff, that his (i.e. \[_redacted_\]) was a “one man show” company, implying that he was the sole reason for the company’s success and disregarding all the contributions of the Plaintiff and others. The Plaintiff was disappointed and upset that all her efforts appeared to go unrecognised and was unappreciated by the Defendant.

>> d.    The Parties had frequent disagreements over their business, and these disagreement and arguments only escalated over time. Sometime around 2012, after a big quarrel, the Defendant stopped talking to the Plaintiff for around 4 months. Since then, the Defendant also stopped sharing the company’s intended property investments with the Plaintiff. In the past, he would bring her along on site visits, but he no longer did so, or even consulted her. The Plaintiff would only find out new investments later on, from staff or even outsiders such as property agents.

> 27    …

20     I accept that paragraphs 5 to 22 of the SOP do not by themselves constitute an allegation of unreasonable behaviour. The crux of the matter is whether these particulars “significantly accentuate the unreasonableness of the behaviour set out in certain other particulars”: see _Chen Stella_ (at \[23(7)\])

21     In _Chen Stella_, the court noted (at \[20\]) that “\[i\]n the context of unreasonable behaviour particulars, the history or background of any interaction between the parties, or any third parties, may be necessary to explain why a certain set of words or actions would constitute unreasonable behaviour”. The following example given by the court (at \[21\]) is instructive:

> If a husband says to his wife “You are ugly.”, this is a sentence that may be reasonably construed as a hurtful thing to say, and therefore an incident of unreasonable behaviour, without requiring any further particulars. But the fact that the wife has had her face disfigured in a past traffic accident would significantly accentuate the hurtfulness of the remark, and hence the unreasonableness of the behaviour in making that remark. The fact of the traffic accident and disfigurement are therefore material facts.”

22     It is clear from the above that particulars that significantly accentuate the unreasonableness of the behaviour set out in certain other particulars do not have to comprise particulars of unreasonable behaviour by themselves to constitute material facts. In the example given, the fact of the traffic accident and disfigurement are not particulars of unreasonable behaviour by themselves, but they are nonetheless considered to be material facts as they accentuate the hurtfulness of the remark “You are ugly”, and hence the unreasonableness of the behaviour in making that remark.

23     Similarly, in the present case, the facts pleaded in paragraphs 5 to 22, which showed how the Wife had stood by the Husband for many years and help grow the business empire, are not particulars of unreasonable behaviour by themselves. However, they accentuate the hurtfulness of the behaviour of the Husband, set out in the other particulars. In particular:

> (a)     Paragraph 4(a):

>> Although the Parties worked together for many years to build up a business empire, include \[redacted\], a successful business listed on the Singapore Exchange, the Defendant has thoroughly belittled the Plaintiff’s work and effort, and has consistently failed to give the Plaintiff her due.

> (b)     Paragraph 4(b):

>> The Defendant’s unreasonable extended to verbal abuse of the Plaintiff, including in front of the staff of \[redacted\], to such an extend that the Plaintiff has been diagnosed with clinical depression for which she has had to consult psychiatrists and take psychiatric medication.

> (c)     Paragraph 25:

>> The Defendant could be a difficult man to live with, especially when it came to issues involving money. Over the years, many of the Parties’ quarrels were due to financial issues. The Defendant was especially difficult to be around when times were difficult for the business often snapping and shouting at the Plaintiff, the Child, and those around him. He would belittle the Plaintiff, complaining and accusing her of not pulling her weight while he was always having to work so hard for the family. The Defendant’s behaviour exacerbated over time.

> (d)     Paragraph 26:

>> Through it all, the Plaintiff had supported him and remained at his side, in the hope that financial success would bring the Parties’ marital happiness. Unfortunately, instead of improving with success, the Defendant’s attitude towards the Plaintiff only worsened. Over the years, it grew increasingly clear to the Plaintiff that the Defendant had allowed the success of their business to go to his ego. Despite the fact that the Plaintiff had been heavily involved in the business, the Defendant views only himself as the sole architect of the Parties’ success.

> (e)     Paragraph 27:

>> The Defendant’s treatment of the Plaintiff progressively worsened. He would constantly belittle and undermine her, even in public. He would scold her in front of their staff, humiliating and embarrassing her. Such emotionally abusive behaviour from the Defendant grew more and more common, and has a severe negative impact on the Plaintiff’s mental state. Some recent incidents in the last few years come to the Plaintiff’s mind …

24     Given the sacrifices the Wife has made in the course of their long marriage as particularised in paras 5 to 22 of the SOP, how could the Husband have treated her in the way that he did as alleged in paragraphs 4, 25, 26 and 27 of the SOP? The particulars in paragraphs 5 to 22 clearly accentuate the unreasonableness of the Husband’s behaviour set out in paragraphs 4, 25, 26 and 27 in a significant way. They show the extent of the Husband’s unreasonableness when he belittled her contributions and treated her so badly despite the fact that she has stood by him in the best and worst of times and supported him in growing the business in the course of their 32 year-old marriage.

25     I should point out that the discussion so far has centred on the behaviour of the Husband. However, it is necessary to bear in mind that under s 95(3)(b) of the Women’s Charter, there are two requirements to prove irretrievable breakdown of marriage : (i) that the defendant has engaged in a particular course of behaviour; and (ii) it is unreasonable to expect the plaintiff to continue cohabitation. As noted by the High Court in _Teo Hoon Ping v Tan Lay Ying Angeline_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 1 SLR 691</span> (at \[38\]), the abbreviation “unreasonable behaviour” is a “misnomer” and that “the analysis should be on whether the … union has become impossible, rather than on any consideration of blameworthiness.”

26     As noted by Professor Leong Wai Kum in _Elements of Family Law in Singapore_ (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2018) (at pages 193-194) :

> The behaviour of the defendant must have affected the plaintiff such that it is unreasonable to expect the plaintiff to continue to cohabit with the defendant. It is this effect of the defendant’s behaviour that seals the proof of the marriage having irretrievable broken down …

> The use of the adjective “unreasonable” to qualify the expectation that the plaintiff continue with the marital cohabitation requires an objective assessment. The test is whether the plaintiff can be expected to tolerate the defendant’s behaviour and continue to cohabit with her is objective …

> As the High Court in _Wong Siew Boey v Lee Boon Fatt_ decided, it needs to ask whether the particular plaintiff before it, with her character, personality, faults and other attributes, can reasonably be expected to live with the defendant, with her character, personality, faults and other attributes. It is an objective determination within the subjectivity of the particular parties before the court. This does not detract from the fact that, where a court finds that it is objectively speaking unreasonable to expect anyone to continue cohabitation with the defendant who behaves the way she does, this can only help the plaintiff’s case.

27     Given the fact that it is a requirement for the court to determine, objectively, whether the Wife can be expected to tolerate the Husband’s behaviour and continue to cohabit with him, clearly, the facts relating to the marriage and her efforts toward building the parties’ business empire are material facts that go towards this objective assessment. This is particularly so having regard to the fact that it is the Wife’s pleaded case that the Husband has “thoroughly belittled the Plaintiff’s work and efforts, and has consistently failed to give the Plaintiff her due” (paragraph 4(a) of the SOP) and that the Husband’s “unreasonable behaviour extended to verbal abuse of the Plaintiff, including in front of the staff of \[redacted\], to such an extent that the Plaintiff has been diagnosed with clinical depression” (paragraph 4(b) of the SOP).

28     It is the Wife’s pleaded case that the “Defendant’s treatment of the Plaintiff progressively worsened” (paragraph 27 of the SOP) and that the Defendant “would constantly belittle her and undermine her, even in public. He would scold her in front of their staff, humiliating and embarrassing her.” (paragraph 27 of the SOP).

29     In my judgment, the extent of the humiliation and embarrassment must be assessed against the proper context – which includes the fact that she was involved in the day-to-day operations of the hotel as pleaded in paragraph 18 of the SOP, the fact that she frequently worked long hours, even standing-in at the front desk and often going personally to the hotel at all hours whenever hotel staff faced IT problems” as pleaded in paragraph 16 of the SOP and the other circumstances set out in the SOP.

30     In other words, paragraphs 5 to 22 of the SOP are not merely facts that accentuate the unreasonableness of the Husband’s behaviour; they are material facts that go towards the objective determination of whether the Wife can be expected to tolerate the Husband’s behaviour and continue to cohabit with him. They go towards the question as to whether it is unreasonable to expect the Wife, who has “rolled up her own sleeves and pitching in with her own time and labour” (paragraph 24 of the SOP) to continue cohabitation with the Husband having regard to way that he has belittled and humiliated her as alleged.

31     As the facts pleaded in paragraphs 5 to 22 of the SOP are material facts, it cannot be said they disclose no reasonable cause of action or that they are scandalous, frivolous and vexatious or that they may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action or that they are an abuse of the process of the Court. In the circumstances, I find that none of the requirements for striking out under Rule 405 of the FJR have been satisfied. Accordingly, I find that SUM 1942 was correctly dismissed by the AR.

32     The fact that paragraphs 5 to 22 are relevant to the determination of the division of matrimonial assets is not a reason by itself to strike out. A fact – such as the systematic poisoning of a spouse (such as in _Chan Tin Sun v Fong Quay Sim_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGCA 2</span>) – can be both a material fact in a divorce trial and a relevant fact in the division of matrimonial assets. There is no principle at law that a relevant fact in an AM hearing cannot also be a material fact in a divorce trial.

## Other points of submissions

33     The Husband has also contended that paragraphs 5 to 22 of the SOP are vexatious as there are two Co-Defendants involved when they need not be named as parties under the relevant rules and that the Wife’s decision to include these particulars and to serve the papers on him and the Co-Defendants is a clear abuse of process.[^16] However, there is nothing in paragraphs 5 to 22 of the SOP that made reference to the two Co-defendants. The submission, insofar as it relates to paragraphs 5 to 22 of the SOP, is clearly misconceived.

34     The Husband has also drawn my attention to the case of _VGY v VGZ_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHCF 6</span> where Debbie Ong J held (at \[11\]) that “parties should assist the court to reach a just decision, and not inundate and distract the court and parties with voluminous amounts of materials that are not relevant to the issues before the court”. The Husband submits that while this decision deals with the issue of ancillary matters, the principles therein apply with force to the divorce trial. The Husband highlights that much precious judicial time would be wasted for parties to conduct cross-examination on each of these disputed facts as they would be relevant to the ancillary matters and should not be left unanswered.[^17]

35     However, this submission fails to recognise that there are significant differences between a divorce trial and an AM hearing. A divorce trial, like any other civil trial, is regulated by rules of pleadings. As noted in _Bumi Geo Engineering Pte Ltd v Civil Tech Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 261</span> (at \[56\]):

> While it is good sense not to be pernickety about pleadings, the basic requirement that material facts should be pleaded is there for a good reason — so that the other side can respond to the pleaded case by way of admission or denial of facts, thereby defining the issues for decision for the benefit of the parties and the court. Proper pleading of the material facts is essential for the orderly progress of the case and for its sound determination. The definition of the issues has an impact on such important matters as disclosure of relevant documents and the relevant oral evidence to be adduced at trial …

36     In contrast, there are no pleadings in an AM proceeding and a “broad-brush” approach is adopted in the division of matrimonial assets. The distinction between an AM proceeding and a civil trial has been highlighted in a number of cases: _TIG v TIH_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHCF 12</span>; _UDA v UDB_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHCF 17</span>; _UYP v UYQ_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHCF 16</span> (“_UYP v UYQ_”) ; _USB v USA_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 57</span>.

37     In _UYP v UYQ_, Debbie Ong J observed (at \[61\]) as follows:

> It is significant to note that a civil trial is markedly different from an AM proceeding. In civil proceedings, parties set out their cases in their pleadings and are bound by them. Facts which are pleaded to support a cause of action are proved in the court proceedings. Where there are gaps in evidence and a party asserting a fact is unable to prove it, he or she may not have discharged the requisite burden of proof. A successful litigant would be one who has proved his or her pleaded facts that support the pleaded case. A court may find against a litigant who fails to provide evidence to prove those facts. In contrast, in proceedings for the division of MAs, the court is presented with only a fraction of each party’s “contribution” to the marriage, yet parties seek the court’s determination on what is a just division based substantially on each party’s direct and indirect contributions in the _entire marriage_. Had a similar approach as that used in civil matters been taken, the Family Court presented with a 30-year marriage would have had to examine the entire contributions and conduct of each spouse over 30 years, possibly examining the daily records of each act done, each decision made, each word uttered every day and night over 30 years, for that is the only way to fully assess what contributions each had made to the marriage. This is an impossible exercise. Neither does such an exercise accord with the aspirations of the family justice system to enable the harmonious resolution of family disputes and for parties to continue family life after divorce in the most dignified manner possible. The court determines the division of assets by affidavit evidence unless leave is granted for the cross-examination of witnesses (see rr 42, 81(2) and 590 of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (S 813/2014)). This mode of proceedings is suitable because the “broad brush” approach is core to the exercise of discretion in s 112. It is appropriate because marriage is an intimate partnership between two spouses who had decided very solemnly to join their lives together.

38     Notwithstanding the differences between a divorce trial and an AM hearing, it bears reiterating that the overarching philosophy of the family justice system is to encourage and support the amicable resolution of family disputes so that parties can move on with their lives after divorce in the most dignified manner possible. There is hence an expectation under Rule 15A of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct Rules) 2015 that a legal practitioner who represents a client in any family proceedings must inform the client of all available dispute resolution options including mediation and counselling, and whenever it is reasonably possible, to advise the client to consider resolving those proceedings amicably and to be constructive and reasonable when participating in those proceedings. In the present case, the parties have accepted that the marriage has broken down irretrievably[^18] and the Husband has filed a counterclaim also seeking a divorce. Given these circumstances, I would encourage the parties to consider resolving the divorce amicably even if they are unable to agree on the ancillary matters at this stage.

39     Finally, the Husband has also made references to remarks made by the AR (such as the AR’s observation that the Husband’s position taken in his application for further and better particulars was inconsistent from his position in his striking out application[^19]) to suggest that the AR had fallen into errors. As this appeal is a confirmatory hearing, I do not find it necessary to go into the merits of those submissions. In any event, it is clear that the AR had dismissed the application on basis that paragraphs 5 to 22 of the SOP significantly accentuate the unreasonableness of the Husband’s behaviour.

40     For the above reasons, I dismissed the appeal with costs fixed at $1,200.
