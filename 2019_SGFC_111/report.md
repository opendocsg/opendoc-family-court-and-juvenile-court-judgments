Family Law – Variation of Maintenance Order – Lump Sum Maintenance

15 October 2019

### District Judge Eugene Tay:

## Background

1       The Plaintiff ex-wife and the Defendant ex-husband were married in United States of America (“USA”) on or about xxx December 1998. The Plaintiff filed for divorce against the Defendant on or about 28 October 2011. Interim Judgment (“IJ”) was granted on 3 July 2012. Clause 3 of the IJ contained the following consent orders on ancillary matters (“Consent Order”):

> a)     That the Plaintiff and the Defendant shall have joint custody of the 2 children of the marriage, namely B and C ("the children"). The Plaintiff shall have care and control of the children, with liberty to return to the USA with the children in December 2012.

> b)     The Defendant shall have liberal access to the children as follows:

>> i)       Tuesdays, Thursdays and alternate weekends.

>> ii)       One week before the children return to the USA in July 2012.

>> iii)       When the children are in the USA, one week during the designated school vacations, with not more than 7 consecutive days for each access period, save for the longer summer vacation where a period of up to 3 weeks may be arranged. All costs associated with access are to be borne by the Defendant. The Defendant shall give the Plaintiff at least 1 month's advance notice of his intended visit and shall give a detailed itinerary and contact details of any trip at least 14 days in advance, including the trip referred to in (ii) above. The children shall remain contactable by phone at all times during access with the Defendant.

>> iv)       Unlimited phone, email and Skype access.

>> v)       In the event that the Plaintiff intends to relocate out of New York State, she shall provide the Defendant with at least 6 month's advance notice of her intention. Any notice of less than 6 months shall be subject to agreement between parties.

> c)     The Defendant shall pay the Plaintiff nominal monthly maintenance of S$1.00 with effect from the date of this Order.

> d)     The Defendant shall pay the Plaintiff USD$500.00 per child (total USD$1,000.00) as monthly maintenance for the children, with effect from the date of this Order. The Defendant shall contribute 25% of the total value of his salary package, should the calculation result in a higher maintenance payment. This shall be capped at a maximum payment of 50% of the children's total expenses. The Plaintiff shall forward a prospective statement of expenses for the children (including education and special education expenses; and their share of the household expenses) by mid-August of each year and parties shall exchange statements of respective salaries, for parties to calculate their respective contributions for the children.

> e)     Parties joint matrimonial assets shall be divided in the proportion of 65% - 35% in favour of the Plaintiff. This shall include the Merrill Lynch account, Royal Bank of Canada account, Idex Fund, Wine Investments and joint DBS account.

> f)     Parties shall retain all other assets in their respective names.

> g)     Each party shall bear their own costs of the proceedings.

> h)     Liberty to apply.

2       On 18 June 2015, pursuant to an application taken out by the Plaintiff in Summons No. xxx/2015 (“SUM xxx”) in respect of maintenance for the children in Clause 3(d) of the Consent Order, the Court passed the following orders:

> 1.     Clause 3(d) of the (Consent Order) respecting the maintenance for the children of the marriage be varied as follows:

>> a.       That the Defendant shall pay the Plaintiff a sum of USD$1,500 as monthly maintenance for both children with effect from July 2015.

>> b.       Each party shall bear their own costs.

>> (“June 2015 Order”)[^1]

3       In Summons No. 622/2019 (“SUM 622”), the Defendant applied for the following orders:

> 1.     That the Plaintiff does, within 1 week of the order made herein, comply with Paragraph 3(e) of the Consent Order as set out in \[the IJ\] to divide and distribute the joint matrimonial assets, by carrying out the following:

>> a.       Transfer to the Defendant his remaining share of the monies in the Royal Bank of Canada account referred to in Paragraph 3(e) of the Consent Order, by transferring to him the US Dollars equivalent (as at the date of the transfer) of CAD$20,018.33 by way of a cashier’s order made out to the Defendant and sent via courier to \[the Defendant\], xxx;

>> b.       Transfer to the Defendant his share of the monies in the joint DBS account referred to in Paragraph 3(e) of the Consent Order, by transferring to him the US Dollars equivalent (as at the date of the transfer) of SG$412.66 by way of a cashier’s order made out to the Defendant and sent via courier to \[the Defendant\], xxx;

>> c.       Transfer to the Defendant his share of the Idex Fund referred to in Paragraph 3(e) of the Consent Order, by duly executing the relevant form (a blank copy of which was sent to the Plaintiff’s lawyers, East Asia Law Corporation, in Tan Rajah & Cheah’s letter of 10 January 2019) with Transamerica to give instructions for the assets in the account to be divided in a 35% - 65% manner, in favour of the Plaintiff;

>> d.       Transfer to the Defendant his share of the assets in Merrill Lynch account referred to in Paragraph 3(e) of the Consent Order, by duly executing the relevant form (a blank copy of which was sent to the Plaintiff’s lawyers, East Asia Law Corporation, in Tan Rajah & Cheah’s letter of 10 January 2019) with Merrill Lynch to give instructions for the assets in the account to be divided in a 35% - 65% manner, in favour of the Plaintiff.

4       In Summons No. 1686/2019 (“SUM 1686”), the Plaintiff applied for the following orders:

> 1.     Clause 3(d) of the Consent Order under \[the IJ\] varied by the \[June 2015 Order\] be varied to read as follows:-

>> a.       That the Defendant shall pay the Plaintiff such lump sum of USD$88,500.00 or other reasonable sum to be assessed by the Honourable Court as the children’s maintenance up to their age of majority;

>> b.       That the maintenance payable by the Defendant in respect of the children’s maintenance as ordered above herein shall be deducted from the Defendant’s share of the matrimonial assets to be ordered pursuant to \[SUM 622\];

>> c.       The monies deducted from the Defendant’s share of the matrimonial assets being the children’s maintenance shall be directly paid and/or released to the Plaintiff by the banks/financial institutions holding the parties’ matrimonial assets;

>> d.       Liberty to apply.

5       I heard both SUM 622 and SUM 1686 together on 11 July 2019.

6       For SUM 622, by consent, I granted Order in Terms in respect of prayers 1a. to d. as set out at \[3\] above. I also ordered, by consent, that parties to take steps to effect the division of the Wine Investment in the proportion of 65%-35% in favour of the Plaintiff pursuant to Clause 3(e) of the Consent Order under the IJ. I furthered ordered each party to bear his or her own costs.

7       For SUM 1686, I passed the following orders:

> 1.     Clause 3(d) of the Consent Order under the \[IJ\] as varied by the \[June 2015 Order\] shall be varied as follows:

>> That the Defendant shall pay the Plaintiff a lump sum of US$81,750.00 as maintenance for the children into the Plaintiff’s designated bank account within 1 week after the assets in the Merrill Lynch account referred to in clause 3(e) of \[the IJ\] has been divided.

> 2.     Each party to bear his or her own costs.

8       On or about 15 July 2019, the Defendant filed his Notice of Appeal against the whole of my decision in SUM 1686 as set out at \[7\] above.

9       Since only the orders in relation to SUM 1686 are the subject of appeal, this judgment will be confined to the reasons for my decision in SUM 1686.

## The Plaintiff’s case in SUM 1686

10     The Plaintiff sought a variation of the current order for monthly payment of children’s maintenance to that of a lump sum payment of USD$88,500.00 to account for the children’s maintenance until they turn 21 years old[^2]. In her written submissions, the Plaintiff stated there are two substantive issues in relation to SUM 1686[^3]. The first is whether the Plaintiff should be granted lump sum maintenance. The second is whether lump sum maintenance ought to be deducted from the Defendant’s share of matrimonial assets.

11     The Plaintiff submitted that there is material change in circumstances now that she had relocated to the USA with the children, and that the Defendant had been in contumelious breach of his maintenance obligations since March 2019 after filing SUM 622[^4]. She pointed out that at the material time when the Consent Order was entered into, it was not disputed that she and the children were still living in Singapore[^5].

12     The Plaintiff submitted that now that parties are both no longer in Singapore, there is a material change in circumstances in that it will be difficult, if not impossible for the Plaintiff to enforce the existing period maintenance orders against the Defendant[^6]. The Plaintiff asserted that this puts her and the children in an extremely precarious position, especially as the Defendant had already taken it upon himself to “suspend” maintenance payment, and she submitted that defaults in payment are likely to continue in the future[^7].

13     The Plaintiff highlighted that since March 2019, the Defendant had been in breach of the existing maintenance orders even though he was not facing any precarious financial predicament, and that as at July 2019, the Defendant is in arrears of USD$7,500.00[^8].

14     The Plaintiff submitted that given the Defendant’s flippant attitude towards his maintenance obligation even though he clearly has the financial means to meet these obligations, he does not intend to fulfil his maintenance obligations[^9]. As such, the Plaintiff will likely need to enforce the periodic maintenance orders against the Defendant in years to come, and it will be very impractical, costly and difficult for her to do so in Singapore[^10].

15     For the above reasons, the Plaintiff submitted that it is reasonable and in the best interests of the children for the existing period maintenance orders to be varied into a lump sum maintenance order[^11]. A clean break is desirable to enable parties to move on with their lives and to avoid “further rancorous interactions”, and would be in the children’s best interests[^12].

16     The Plaintiff finally pointed out that after paying lump sum maintenance to her, the Defendant will have sufficient monies left and it will not cripple him financially[^13], as the lump sum that the Plaintiff is seeking will not wipe out his entire assets[^14]. The Plaintiff submitted that the Defendant has sufficient assets from the matrimonial pool to make lump sum payment[^15].

## The Defendant’s case

17     The Defendant contended that the Plaintiff has not shown any material change in circumstances since “the variations agreed in June 2015”[^16].

18     The Defendant stated that the Plaintiff’s primary basis of applying to vary the maintenance order for the children appeared to be that he has not paid for the children’s maintenance since March 2019. The Defendant submitted that this is an issue of enforcement and that the Plaintiff’s application for variation is misconceived[^17]. He added that he had set out his reasons for withholding payment but he has not denied or sought to renege from his obligations[^18].

19     The Defendant claimed that he had carried out his obligations to pay maintenance despite the Plaintiff’s repeated refusal to carry out the orders on division, and there is thus no basis for her to state that she believes he would refuse to pay the children’s maintenance if the orders on division were complied with[^19]. In any case, the orders are separate and not conditional upon each other.

20     The Defendant submitted that the Plaintiff’s application is not reasonable or in the children’s best interests[^20]. He added that the clean break principle would not be applicable in the present case as the maintenance orders related to the children and not between the parties[^21].

21     The Defendant stated that he had already faced difficulties keeping in touch with the children as a result of the Plaintiff’s failure to keep him updated on the children’s affairs and also to facilitate communication between him and the children[^22]. He contended that if a clean break is allowed, the Plaintiff would be the party who would refuse to comply with the orders relating to the children and that he would have no access to the children[^23].

22     The Defendant submitted that the Plaintiff’s application is clearly misconceived and not based on any change in circumstances, and that she should not be allowed to attempt to achieve her ulterior motive of a “clean break” between him and the children through the payment of a lump sum maintenance[^24].

23     The Defendant concluded by stating that “the parties had agreed on a variation to the Consent Order on maintenance a short while ago and the Plaintiff should not be allowed to seek a further variation.”[^25] He added that any order for lump sum maintenance will place unreasonable hardship on him[^26].

## Decision

24     There are essentially three issues I had to consider for SUM 1686. The first is whether it the Court should vary the existing order for the Defendant to pay monthly periodic maintenance for the children to an order for the Defendant to pay lump sum maintenance (“the First Issue”). If the First Issue is answered in the affirmative, the second issue is the quantum of lump sum maintenance to be paid (“the Second Issue”). Finally, the third issue is when and how such sum lump sum maintenance is to be paid (“the Third Issue”).

25     On a preliminary note, the Defendant appeared to be under the impression that the June 2015 Order in respect of the children’s maintenance pursuant to SUM xxx was made with parties’ consent. This is not the case. Based on the Court’s records, the Court had on 18 June 2015 adjudicated on SUM xxx and passed the June 2015 Order. Further, as stated in footnote 1 above, on 11 August 2019 the same Court had upheld the June 2015 Order.

26     On the First Issue, it is not in dispute that since March 2019, the Defendant had been withholding payment of monthly maintenance for the children. In the Defendant’s own affidavit filed on 31 May 2019 in support of SUM 622 and in response to SUM 1686, the Defendant stated as follows:

> _“5_.     _… In fact_, **_until I stopped payment of the maintenance for the children a few months ago_**_, the Plaintiff did not respond to a single e-mail of mine in which I sought updates on the children’s well-being and for a means to contact them. For the avoidance of doubt, I am prepared to pay the arrears of maintenance to my solicitors to hold as stakeholders and to the said sum to be released (i) after the Plaintiff carries out the division of the matrimonial assets and (ii) give me credit for the excess payment I made when my daughter resided with me in the United States from October 2017 to July 2018._

> _…_

> _22_.     _I deny that I have ever adopted a “nonchalant attitude in obeying court orders”._ **_Until I stopped payment in March 2019_** _, I have diligently paid the children’ maintenance since the Consent Order was given. My decision to stop making payment of the children’s maintenance was meant to be a temporary one which was forced by the Plaintiff’s conduct. I do care deeply about both my children and I would not withhold the payment of their maintenance unless I had no other choice._

> _…_

> _26_.     _Notwithstanding her conduct, I had duly paid the monthly maintenance all the way_ **_until March 2019_** _. …_

> _27_.     **_I stopped making the payments only recently in March 2019_** _, after it became apparent that the Plaintiff was not responding to my solicitors’ letters and even her own solicitors. …_

> _28_.     _I was desperate at that point_ **_and I had hoped that, by stopping the payments of maintenance, the Plaintiff would start to comply with the Consent Order and allow me to properly have joint custody of and liberal access to the children.”_**

> (emphasis added)

27     In the Defendant’s own written submissions, it was also stated as follows:

> _“8_.     _The maintenance was varied by consent and the Defendant has paid the children’s maintenance in a timely fashion as per the order from July 2015_ **_till March 2019 wherein he acknowledges that he has held back on paying maintenance in hopes of getting a response from the Plaintiff given her lack of response on the assets and the children’s well-being_** _.”[^27]_

> (emphasis added)

28     As can be seen from the above, what the Defendant is essentially saying is that he was forced by the Plaintiff’s conduct to hold back payment of monthly maintenance for the children, purportedly in the hope of getting response from the Plaintiff on the division of assets as well as on the children’s well-being and access to the children.

29     It should be emphasised that the Defendant’s obligations to pay the Plaintiff monthly maintenance for the children under the existing court order are distinct and separate from the Plaintiff’s obligations to give effect to the existing court order regarding custody and access to the children. Neither is the Defendant’s obligations to pay such monthly maintenance dependent or conditional upon parties giving effect to parties’ obligations to give effect to the orders for division of assets. For avoidance of doubt, there are no such conditions or terms set out in both the Consent Order as well as the June 2015 Order.

30     Whatever purported challenges or struggles the Defendant may face as a result of any alleged failure on the Plaintiff’s part to keep him updated on the children’s affairs and facilitate communication between him and the children, or any lack of response by the Plaintiff in relation to dividing the assets, he should not take it upon himself to deliberately withhold paying maintenance for the children. This is because at the end of the day, it would be the children’s welfare and interests that would be affected and compromised by lack of financial provision, as provided for under the June 2015 Order. If the Defendant is of the view that the Plaintiff had not been complying with aspects of the Consent Order relating to division of assets and/or custody and access, he is at liberty to take out the relevant application in Court to compel her to comply.

31     On whether the Court should order lump sum maintenance for the children’s maintenance, both parties cited the case of _AYM v AYL and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGCA 46</span> (“_AYM_”), where the Court of Appeal held at \[18\] as follows:

> “18    The following principles concerning lump sum maintenance payments may be extracted from the case law:

>> (a)    A lump sum payment allows for a clean break in the marriage and should be availed of whenever feasible (_Lee Puey Hwa v Tay Cheow Seng_ <span class="citation">\[1991\] 2 SLR(R) 196</span> (“_Lee Puey Hwa_”) at \[9\]). Such a clean break may help avoid further litigation and acrimony between the parties (_Wan Lai Cheng v Quek Seow Kee_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 4 SLR 405</span> (“_Wan Lai Cheng_”) at \[88\]).

>> (b)    A lump sum payment should not be ordered if it would cripple the husband financially (_Lee Puey Hwa_ at \[9\]; and _Neo Mei Lan Helena v Long Melvin Anthony_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 2 SLR(R) 616</span> (“_Neo Mei Lan Helena_”)).

>> (c)    A lump sum payment is appropriate where there is reason to believe that defaults in payments may be likely (_Neo Mei Lan Helena_ and _BCS v BCT_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGDC 338</span>)”

32     It was not disputed that at the material time when the Consent Order was entered into, the Plaintiff and the children were still living in Singapore. As at the date of this hearing, both the Plaintiff[^28] and the Defendant and are currently not living in Singapore, and are both living in the United States. Now that parties are both no longer in Singapore, this would make any application(s) for enforcement of periodic maintenance orders in Singapore difficult and onerous, not to mention impractical, for the Plaintiff, as for every application, she would have to travel down all the way down from the United States to Singapore to file her application in Court. In addition, even after she does travel to Singapore to file her application in Court, her application would still have to be served on the Defendant in the United States.

33     In my view, there is force in the Plaintiff’s submission that she and the children are in a precarious position, as the Defendant has already taken it upon himself to “suspend” maintenance payments, and that defaults in payment are likely to continue in the future. Based on the Defendant’s deliberate and unilateral acts of withholding payment of the children’s maintenance as can be gleaned from his own evidence reproduced at \[26\] above, more likely than not, such acts would likely re-occur from time to time. This is especially if the Defendant continues to have issues with the Plaintiff not complying with existing court orders and/or not responding or acceding to his requests involving the dividing of assets or communication with and access to the children. My view is fortified by the fact that the Defendant’s own claim that he is prepared to pay the arrears of maintenance to his solicitors to hold as stakeholders contained the proviso that the said sum is to be released _after_ the Plaintiff carries out division of the matrimonial assets and gives him credit for excess payment made when the daughter resided with him in USA from October 2017 to July 2018[^29]. Even though Defendant’s counsel had informed the Court at the hearing on 11 July 2019 that they are currently holding arrears in maintenance as stakeholders pending determination of the matter[^30], the fact remained that since March 2019 the maintenance monies have not been reaching the children.

34     The Defendant had asserted that he is not in a good financial position at all and has no permanent employment presently despite having made extensive efforts to search for employment[^31]. However, this mere assertion alone was insufficient for me to conclude that he is unable or lacks the financial resources to pay any lump sum maintenance for the children, or that he will be financially crippled if ordered to do so. Suffice to say that he did not elaborate or provide further details on how he is not in a good financial position. There was also lack of documentary proof adduced by him to support this assertion.

35     On the other hand, if parties carry out the orders passed for SUM 622 as set out at \[3\] and \[6\] above to divide and distribute the joint matrimonial assets within one week of the order, the Defendant would receive his share of the joint matrimonial assets to add to his financial resources. Even if I had disregarded the value of the Wine Investment (estimated by the Plaintiff at SGD$5,475.30 (USD$4,000.00), which the Defendant disputed), the undisputed estimated total value of the remaining assets would still come up to SGD$616,793.57 (SGD$622,268.87 estimated by the Plaintiff less SGD$5,475.30)[^32]. Under Clause 3(e) of the Consent Order, the Defendant’s share of these joint matrimonial assets is 35%, which would work out to be the amount of SGD$215,877.75 (35% of SGD$616,793.57) or USD$157,575.00, based on USD$1 = SGD$1.37. As such, even if the full lump sum maintenance of USD$88,500.00 as claimed by the Plaintiff were to be deducted from the Defendant’s share of the assets, he would not be left financially crippled as there would still be a balance of at least USD$69,000.00 for his own.

36     Overall, having considered the relevant factors, evidence and submissions, I accepted the Plaintiff’s submission that in the circumstances, a lump sum maintenance order for the children is reasonable and in the children’s best interest. As such, for the First Issue, I was of the view that the periodic maintenance order for the children should be varied to a lump sum maintenance order.

37     Having found the First Issue to be in the affirmative, I had to determine the Second Issue being the quantum of lump sum maintenance to be paid.

38     To begin with, under the June 2015 Order as set out at \[2\] above, the Defendant was to pay the Plaintiff USD$1,500.00 as monthly maintenance for both the children with effect from July 2015. Plaintiff’s counsel had submitted that out of USD$1,500.00, USD$500.00 was for the daughter and USD$1,000.00 was for the son, and had taken pains to attempt to explain that the Court in passing the June 2015 Order had increased the sum based on the son’s expenses[^33]. However, having perused the Notes of Evidence for the hearing on 18 June 2015, I concluded that at best it may be suggestive. On the other hand, paragraph 3 of the June 2015 Order clearly states that the Defendant was to pay the Plaintiff USD$1,500.00 as monthly maintenance for both children with effect from July 2015. There is nothing in the June 2015 Order that stipulates or specifies _how_ the USD$1,500.00 is to be apportioned between the two children. Moreover, during the further hearing on 11 August 2015, the same Court upheld the June 2015 Order, without stipulating or specifying the breakdown of USD$1,500.00 for both the children.

39     As such, in the absence of clear and express pronouncement or clarification by the Court that passed the June 2015 Order, I was unable to reach the conclusion that out of the USD$1,500.00, USD$500.00 was specifically for the daughter and US$1,000.00 was specifically for the son. I took it that the US$1,500.00 should be apportioned equally between the children, i.e. US$750.00 per child.

40     As stated at \[10\] above, the Plaintiff sought lump sum maintenance to account for the children’s maintenance until they turned 21 years. For the daughter, this would be from March 2019 until July 2022, while for the son, this would be from March 2019 until October 2014. I had noted that although the Defendant had objected to lump sum maintenance for the children, he did not _per se_ dispute the respective periods used by the Plaintiff to calculate lump sum maintenance for the respective children.

41     Following from the above, I calculated lump sum maintenance for the children as follows:

> (a)     For the daughter: 41 months (from March 2019 until July 2022) times USD$750.00 = USD$30,750.00; and

> (b)     For the son: 68 months (from March 2019 until October 2024) times USD$750.00 = USD$51,000.00.

> **Total: USD$30,750.00 plus USD$51,000.00 = USD$81,750.00**.

42     On the Third Issue as to when and how the lump sum maintenance is to be paid, I accepted Plaintiff’s counsel’s submission that it be paid one week after the assets in the Merrill Lynch bank account has been divided pursuant to paragraph 3(e) of the Consent Order and paragraph 1d. of my orders passed for SUM 622 on 11 July 2019 as stated at \[3\] and \[6\] above.

43     Notwithstanding my views set out at \[35\] above, even if I were to only take into account the undisputed estimated value of the assets in the Merrill Lynch account at USD$405,000.00 (which is the asset with the highest estimated value), the Defendant’s 35% share of this asset would come up to USD$141,750.00. As such, once the Defendant has received his share of the assets in the Merrill Lynch account, he would have more than sufficient funds to pay the lump sum maintenance for both children at USD$81,750.00 calculated at \[41\] above. Further, even after paying this lump sum amount, he would still have USD$60,000.00 (USD$141,750.00 less USD$81,750.00) left for his own (excluding other assets), which would not render him financially crippled.

44     For completeness, as Plaintiff’s counsel did not specify which bank account of the Plaintiff the lump sum maintenance was to be paid into, and informed that she will take the Plaintiff’s instructions on which account she prefers, I decided to order that the lump sum maintenance amount of USD$81,750.00 be paid into the Plaintiff’s designated bank account.

45     Finally, on costs, I had considered the issue of costs of both SUM 622 and SUM 1686 together. For SUM 622, although parties had consented to the substantive orders stated at \[6\] above, the fact remained that the Defendant still had to take out SUM 622 to bring the matter before the Court. For SUM 1686, the Plaintiff had actually succeeded substantially in her application for lump sum maintenance for the children. Taking into account the aforesaid, and in order to reduce further acrimony, I decided to order each party to bear their own costs for both SUM 622 as well as SUM 1686.

## Conclusion

46     For the reasons stated above, I made the orders stated at \[7\] above.
