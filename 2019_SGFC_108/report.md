Division of matrimonial assets – Maintenance for the wife and the children

7 October 2019

### District Judge Jen Koh:

## Background to this matter

1       This is the Defendant husband’s appeal against ancillary matters (AM) orders made on 24 July 2019. The wife is the Plaintiff in these proceedings.

2       The parties were married in October 1996 in Singapore. The wife is 46 years old and has a university degree. She is a homemaker and she is not gainfully employed. The husband is 51 years old and is a Diploma holder. He is a businessman and is the founder as well as head of the business. At the hearing of the AM, the husband said that he was not earning an income. They have two children, a 15 year old son and a 14 year old daughter.

3       The wife filed a writ for divorce in May 2018. The husband contested the writ and filed a counterclaim. Both parties relied on particulars of unreasonable behaviour each of the other. As both conceded that the marriage was over, they sensibly agreed to proceed on both the claim and the counter claim and an Interim Judgment dissolving the marriage was granted on 19 September 2018. The parties also managed to enter into a consent order with regard joint custody of the children with care and control to the wife and reasonable access to the husband.

4       The contested ancillary issues that were before me therefore pertained primarily to the financial issues and were as follows (a) the maintenance quantum for the wife and the children (b) division of the matrimonial assets and (c) costs of the proceedings. I heard parties on 27 June 2019 and directed further evidence by way of affidavits. I fixed the AMs for decision on 24 July 2019.

5       On 24 July 2019 I made AM orders as follows:

> 1)      _The Defendant to pay monthly maintenance of $4,000 as maintenance for the Wife for a period of 6 months with effect from 1 August 2019 and thereafter on the 25th day of every month. With effect from 1 February 2020, the amount shall be reduced to $2,000 per month._

> 2)      _The Defendant is to pay monthly maintenance of $3,200 per month per child with effect from 1 August 2019 and thereafter on the 1st day of every month._

> 3)      _The total sum payable of $10,400 per month shall be deposited into the Plaintiff’s POSB eEveryday Savings Account xxx by the 1st day of each month. The amount shall be reduced to $8,400 per month with effect from 1 February 2020._

> 4)      _The Defendant is to reimburse to the Plaintiff a sum of $6,840 for the children’s laptops and this sum shall be repaid to the Plaintiff within 30 days of the date of this order, on or before 25 August 2019._

> 5)      _No orders on prayers 2(viii) (ix) and (x) of Summons 4474/2018._

> 6)      _The stakeholding sums held by M/s Tito Isaac & Co LLP and M/s Eversheds Harry Elias LLP shall be released to the Plaintiff within 7 days from the date of this order and the Plaintiff shall apply the sums to partial repayment of the parties’ loans to the Plaintiff’s sisters._

> 7)      _The Defendant is to pay to the Plaintiff a sum of $112,101.74 this being his share of the repayment of the loans from the Plaintiff’s sister. This shall be paid in 3 equal monthly instalments of $37,336.91 per month on the 1st day of every month on 1 September 2019, 1 October 2019 and 1 November 2019. In default thereof any one instalment, the whole sum shall become due and payable and the Plaintiff shall be entitled to claim interest on the unpaid sum until full repayment._

> 8)      _The Singapore Swimming Club membership currently a Family Membership is to be split up into 2 memberships in the name of the respective parties. The outstanding balances on the current Family Membership is to be paid by the Defendant within 30 days from the date of this order._

> 9)      _The arrears of maintenance and outstanding costs amounting to $21,500 is to be paid by Defendant to Plaintiff within 14 days from the date of this order._

> 10)      _Save as aforesaid, the parties shall retain assets in their own names without further division thereof._

> 11)      _Costs of these proceedings including costs reserved fixed at $2,500 to be paid by Defendant to Plaintiff forthwith._

> 12)      _Liberty to apply._

It is against these orders that the husband has filed his appeal. I now set out the reasons for my decision.

## The issue of maintenance for the wife and the 2 children

#### Interim maintenance orders made on 26 April 2019

6       On 26 April 2019, I made orders for interim maintenance for the wife and the 2 children in Summons xxx/2018. I ordered interim monthly maintenance of $4,500 for the wife and $1,000 per child. I also deferred certain claims by the wife in her summons (prayers 2(vi) to (x) of Summons xxx/2018) to the AM hearing. These were prayers for reimbursement of purchases of laptops for the children and reimbursement of payment of insurance premiums. I informed the parties that I would make orders for these prayers with the AM.

#### Husband’s income - issue

7       There continues to be a dispute pertaining to the husband’s income. I had, at the hearing for interim maintenance, made a finding that the husband’s income and income earning capacity to be at least $14,000 per month, without factoring in commissions.

8       At that hearing, the wife submitted that the husband earned $14,000 per month. This excluded commissions which the wife submitted was of about 10% to 20% of sales and that the husband also earned freelance income of about $10,000 per month. She said that his income was in the region of $24,000 per month excluding commissions. She supported her submission with reference to his bank statements as well as to text messages exchanged between them on his ‘deals’. The husband did not address these allegations save to say he was living on loans from his employers.

9       At the AM hearing, the wife’s submission remained unchanged, namely, that the husband earned a monthly income of $14,000 as an employee. She raised further various deposits she had identified in the husband’s DBS bank account in which he received for 2018: $3,914.93 in May, $342.92 in June with a further $2,000, $1,051 in September and $3,279.12 in October. In April and May 2019, he invoiced his company $6,000 for consultancy services and in April 2019, his bank account showed that he received additional deposits of $5,200 and $2,500. She continued to maintain that the husband’s employers were assisting him with false declarations of his income as an employee as they were his friends.

10     The husband did not reply to explain these deposits. He maintained that he was earning an income of $8,000 per month and that he was extended a loan of $30,000 from his employers disbursed in 5 monthly instalments of $6,000 with effect from 30 April 2018 with full repayment to be made by 31 December 2018. From 1 March 2019, he submitted that his income was $6,100 per month, that he had been put on a 4 months’ hiatus and that he would start looking for a new job. He supported his submissions with letters and agreement with his employers. For the AM hearing, he filed an affidavit at the cusp of the hearing to state that his income was zero. He submitted that he was looking for a job and that he intended to take loans from friends. He said that he did not have the means to afford maintenance even if he was willing to pay.

11     As set out earlier, the husband did not reply to the wife’s submission to explain issue of the deposits as well as the consultancy fees received into his bank account.

#### Wife’s income

12     The wife said that she had applied for many jobs unsuccessfully. In reply, the husband said that she had been searching for a job since 2015 and that she had to lower her expectations in terms of job hunts and positions she was seeking employment in. He found it unbelievable that she had not been able to secure a job for the past 4 to 5 years.

13     He referred to the wife’s degree in mass communication and her occupation history, highlighting her salary of about $11,000 to $14,000 per month when she was head of programming at a prominent television network between June 2008 and November 2013. He submitted that she should assist the family as she was capable of so doing whereas he was caught in a financial bind and would be unable to pay, _inter alia_, his own rent.

#### My findings on parties’ incomes

14     At the IM hearing, I had made a finding that the husband’s income was not merely $8,000 per month. His latest submission that his income was reduced to $6,100 since 1 March 2019 and was currently ‘zero’ was doubtful bearing in mind the deposits into his bank account, his travels as well as credit card spending/deductions from his bank accounts for non-essential expenses – all during the periods in which he was apparently not paid an income or did not have an income.

15     Further, in 2019, notwithstanding the alleged lack of income, he continued to deal with other companies (ML, AV, FK) and he was actively doing work for a temple for a music festival. As for the current zero income, his spending pattern as well as the deposits into his accounts did not reflect this. I refer to paragraph 9 above. The average of the deposits of the sums set out in paragraph 9 divided by the 5 months amounted to $3,657.59 which I rounded off to $4,000 per month. This did not include the invoice of $6,000 for consultancy services in April 2019. Added to his declared income of $8,000 per month before the alleged drop to $6,100 since 1 March 2019, this was $8,000 plus $4,000 at the very least. If one added his consultancy services which he invoiced for $6,000 in April 2019, he would have earned an income or have income earning capacity of about $18,000 ($8,000+$4,000+$6,000). This did not include the unexplained deposits of $5,200 and $2,500 in April 2019 as set out in paragraph 9 and this would have brought his income in April 2019 to $18,000 add $5,200 add $2,500 = $25,700. The wife’s submission of the husband’s income of at least $24,000 per month did not seem as farfetched at the AM hearing, after an investigation into the documents and evidence.

16     Based on documents before me and the regularity of deposits, I accepted that his income/income earning capacity was at least $18,000 per month.

17     As for the wife, the husband’s previous submission about her income earning capacity must be taken into context considering the number of years that she had not worked. I accepted the wife’s submission that her income between 2008 and 2013 should not be applied to her as the standard – that was a position she held as a unique career opportunity and the pay television industry has drastically changed since she held that position in 2013. Nevertheless, I agreed with the husband that there was no reason why she was not able to earn an income and even at entry level in a job in sales or marketing or just giving tuition or any type of part time work, she could possibly earn a modest income of about $2,000 per month.

#### Monthly expenses of parties and children

18     At the IM hearing, I had said that the parties’ as well as the children’s expenses would be re-looked at the AM hearing. After a review of their expenses, I attributed reasonable expenses to the parties and children as follows:

> (a)     A sum of $5,000 per month for the husband including current rental of $2,900 per month

> (b)     A sum of $4,000 per month for the wife

> (c)     A sum of between $3,200 to $3,500 per month each for the children

19     In considering the expenses, I took into account the following matters:

> (a)     The wife estimated her expenses for the home (including rental) and her personal expenses to be $4,741.07 per month and $5,015 per month respectively. I found her claim for groceries and supermarketing excessive. There was also no reason why she needed a part time cleaner as she was a stay home mum with effect from 2014 and the children are teenagers. Even if she started working, the expenses of a part time cleaner could be reduced. I disallowed her claim for outings with friends, ang pow monies and Christmas gifts. I reduced her claims of expenses such as clothes, shoes, entertainment, dining out, skin care and cosmetics, travel and holidays and personal grooming.

> (b)     For the son, the wife estimated his expenses at $3,765 per month excluding his share of rental costs. I allowed most of the education related expenses. I disallowed expenses such as toys and story books and reduced the wife’s estimates for tuition, vitamins, enrichment classes, outings and entertainment, pocket money, clothes, shoes and birthday expenses.

> (c)     For the daughter, the wife estimated her expenses to be $4,261 per month excluding her share of the rental costs. I adopted the same approach as for the son and disallowed unnecessary expenses as set out in paragraph 19(c) above.

> (d)     The husband pegged his expenses at $8,500 per month. I reduced his estimates of his expenses such as food and eating out, clothes, medical, hobbies and sports, tours and family holidays as well as disallowed his expenses for projected insurance premiums.

#### Maintenance order

20     Having considered the issues of income and expenses, I ordered the husband to pay monthly maintenance of $4,000 as maintenance for the wife for a period of 6 months with effect from 25 July 2019. This was the amount that I had assessed she would require for reasonable expenses as set out in paragraph 19 above. With effect from 25 January 2020, the amount shall be reduced to $2,000 per month. The 6 months’ period would allow the wife to commit to a job and to start earning an income of about $2,000 per month which I felt was a reasonable income she could attain.

21     As for the children, I ordered the husband to pay monthly maintenance of $3,200 per month per child. I had made a finding that the children required a sum of between $3,200 to $3,500 per month each. Erring on the side of caution, I ordered the lower sum of $3,200 per month per child. I so ordered because of the findings I had made about the husband’s income and/or income earning capacity as well as the needs of the children.

22     The total sum payable of $10,400 per month shall be deposited into the wife’s account by the 25th day of each month and the amount shall be reduced to $8,400 per month with effect from 25 January 2020.

23     As estimated, the husband’s income was at least $18,000 per month and taken at that level, he would still have about $8,000 per month to manage his own expenses.

24     I deal now with the adjourned prayers of the IM. I first dealt with the issue of the children’s laptops as set out in prayers 2(vi)(vii). The husband was the sole breadwinner of the family at the relevant time. Premised on the findings I had made, he was in a financial position to pay for these items. The children needed laptops for school and their academic work and as such, given his income and income earning capacity, there was no reason why he could not pay this sum and I ordered the repayment of $6,840 to the wife within 30 days of the date of the AM order.

25     I next dealt with prayers 2(viii)(ix) and page 56 of PS1 s/no: 27, 50 which referred to reimbursement of insurance premiums for the children’s insurance policies. I noted the husband’s position that he was not consulted on the purchases of these policies. However, the policies were for medical and hospitalization issues and they did not contain a savings element. In any event, after perusing the wife’s claim and her charts of loans, I was not satisfied that the sum of $5,734.76 was not already being claimed under the loans to the wife’s sister. Given the lack of clarity and the possible prejudice of double counting, I did not allow this claim.

26     As for prayer 2(x) and the claim of $54,000, the amount was to be considered with the issue of liabilities owing to the wife’s sisters. This is dismissed further in my grounds of decision.

## Division of matrimonial assets

#### The former matrimonial home

27     The real property in this case was the parties’ former matrimonial home at xxx (the property). This was purchased in April 2013 or thereabouts. The husband could not finance the mortgage payments when he lost his job in July 2014. The wife was then not working. As the parties did not want to pay the seller’s stamp duty, they held onto the property until they could sell it in the open market without incurring the stamp duty. They paid the mortgage loan with loans from the wife’s relatives, primarily her sisters, with the understanding that upon sale, the loans to the sisters would be paid from the sale proceeds. This agreement was supported by Whatsapp chats and in any event, undenied by both.

28     Parties finally managed to sell the property after an abortive first attempt and the property was sold in February 2018 for $2.74 million. The proceeds were utilized as set out in paragraph 9 of PS1 and undisputed. The balance sale proceeds amounted to $167,581.46 after payment of mortgage loan, refund of parties’ CPF accounts of monies utilized for the purchase, costs and expenses of sale including agent’s commissions and MCST arrears. The amount was decreased to $122,027.53 after further disbursements were made either pursuant to consent or vide an order of Court.

29     I was then asked to adjudicate on this as well as the division of other matrimonial assets.

#### The husband’s position

30     The husband did not apply the legal principles in _ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span> (ANJ) in reviewing the parties’ assets and liabilities. He also did not raise issues with the operative date for delineating the assets for division and/or operative date for valuation of the assets.

31     The husband’s approach was to set out the monies in the stakeholding accounts and he then submitted a percentage on direct financial contributions (DFC). He submitted at 60%-40% in his favour on the basis of his greater DFC contribution. When asked about the list of assets and the date of division, he informed the Court that he agreed with the list of assets as prepared by the wife at page 45 and 46 of PS1 and agreed that his assets were as listed in page 50 and 51 of PS1.

32     The husband’s approach was flawed as he did not capture the essence of the principles of division law as laid out in _ANJ_. He also failed to explain the source documents and figures leading to his DFC claim of 60%. He failed to list out the parties’ assets. At the AM hearing, he informed the Court that he had no issues with the wife’s list (as set out in paragraph 31 above). As such, in light of his position, I relied on the wife’s list in computing the final division numbers. In light of the husband’s acceptance of the list of assets and him not addressing the DFC for the former matrimonial home, the wife’s chart at paragraph 12 of PS1 at page 9 was unchallenged and admitted.

#### Legal principles

33     In determining the operative date for delineating the assets for division, I relied on the guidance of the Court of Appeal which was to use the IJ Date as a general rule, “unless the particular circumstances or justice of the case warrant it”: see _ARY v ARX and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 2 SLR 686</span> (“_ARY v ARX_”) at \[31\]). As for the operative date for valuation of assets, the Court of Appeal said that generally, once an asset is regarded as a matrimonial asset, it ought to be valued as at the AM Date, unless a departure is warranted by the facts (_TND v TNC and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 34</span> (“_TND v TNC_”) at \[19\], commenting on _TDT v TDS and another appeal and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 145</span> at \[50\]). Nevertheless, where parties agreed that a particular date should be used as the date of valuation of the matrimonial assets, a Court should generally adopt that agreed date unless there was good reason not to do so (_TND v TNC_ at \[24\]).

34     As for the _ANJ_ approach, in that case, the Court of Appeal set out a structured approach (at \[17\]–\[30\]) to determine a just and equitable division of matrimonial assets. This approach may be summarised as follows (see _ANJ v ANK_ at \[22\]–\[26\], \[28\]; _Twiss, Christopher James Hans v Twiss, Yvonne Prendergast_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGCA 52</span> (“_Twiss_”) at \[17\]):

> (a)     express as a ratio the parties’ direct contributions relative to each other, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets;

> (b)     express as a second ratio the parties’ indirect contributions relative to each other, having regard to both financial and non-financial contributions; and

> (c)     derive the parties’ overall contributions relative to each other by taking an average of the two ratios above (the derived ratio shall hereinafter be referred to as the “average ratio”), keeping in mind that, depending on the circumstances of each case, the direct and indirect contributions may not be accorded equal weight, and one of the two ratios may be accorded more significance than the other. Adjustments may also be made taking into consideration other relevant factors under ss 112 or 114(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“WC”).

35     The husband having accepted the wife’s chart and dates, I adopted the same set out:

#### Liabilities

36     As for the liabilities that were listed at page 46 to 50 of PS1, he submitted that they should be deducted. I set out my reasons for excluding them:

> (a)     The husband said that he did not know what the loans listed by the wife were for.

>> I could not accept this submission. The wife spelt these out in detail in her affidavits and submitted the breakdown with a chart and with dates. The husband should not blithely ignore these loans by feigning ignorance. He was aware of the expenses. He was not paying for them and the wife was not earning an income. I had to accept the loans as set out as the husband’s reply to the loans did not mean that the loans did not exist. In any event, he accepted that both of them owed monies to her sisters.

> (b)     For his own liabilities and loans, he said that the wife was aware of his 3 loans of $20,000 each; totalling $60,000. He referred to their Whatsapp message and says that the wife had accepted the loans.

>> The wife disagreed with his position and said she questioned the legitimacy of the loans. She had invited the husband to produce evidence of the loans and she had set out her position with regard to his loans in her 2nd AM affidavit. It was incorrect for the husband to state that the loans were acknowledged and agreed by the wife as existing and owing when she took pains to raise her objections thereto. The husband did not respond until he attempted to tender evidence at the AM hearing. He subsequently rectified this with an affidavit for which the wife replied to. In essence, the wife questioned the fact that there were no deposits corresponding with these amounts in the husband’s accounts, no evidence tendered by the husband with regard the use of the monies and no affidavits from the parties to whom he allegedly owed the monies to.

>> I agreed with the wife’s position as the lack of evidence. Further, the lack of supporting documents was telling. A reference by the husband to a Whatsapp exchange between the wife and himself discussing the loans did not mean that the loans were legitimate and/or genuine and/or that the wife accepted these loans and agreed to their deductions.

> (c)     The husband wanted deductions for his credit card expenses.

>> With regard to his credit card expenses (HSBC), these were not to be deducted. The husband used the card for his personal expenses. A perusal of his credit card bills (insofar as the ones that were produced) showed that the expenses were personal in nature and unrelated to the family’s needs/expenses. He had expenses for personal purchases of electronic products, gaming, personal grooming and wellness products, aromatherapy and Paypal transactions. I could not regard these expenses to be for the benefit of the family warranting deduction from the pool of matrimonial assets. The husband also failed to comply with discovery orders to exhibit _inter alia_, certain credit card statements. I took the view that his reluctance for disclosure warranted the Court’s concerns as he was obviously spending on personal luxuries on himself whilst claiming that he was not earning an income.

> (d)     The husband referred to loans owing to his employers.

>> I made a finding about the timing of these loans which were coincidentally extended at a time when the AM hearing was imminent. The husband referred to a letter dated 30 April 2018 from his employers stating that they would be extending a loan of $30,000 to him to be disbursed in 5 monthly instalments with the first payment to him to be on 30 April 2018 and the full sum to be repaid by 31 December 2018. The wife’s position was premised on disclosures from an employee in the husband’s company informing her of the planned falsifying of the husband’s income and the loans; purely to defeat the wife’s claims. The husband’s employers were known to be his close friends and whilst the wife gave an account of their alleged ‘dishonest’ conduct in other matters, I did not place any weight on that allegation.

>> What was apparent and supported by documents was:

>>> (a)       inconsistent deposits into his bank accounts not consonant with the alleged loan payments to him

>>> (b)       that the last payment would be made on 30 November 2018 but full repayment of the entire sum on 31 December 2018 which seemed unlikely

>>> (c)       no repayments or demands from his employers.

> I therefore agreed with the wife and disregarded the loan in light of the timing of the transaction and the lack of supporting documents as set out.

> (e)     As for his income tax liability, he should have provided for these with his income and it is inequitable to expect this to be taken into account.

37     Accordingly, I accepted the numbers set out by the wife in page 59 of PS1 which was also conceded by the husband. This is set out herein: -

#### Indirect contributions

38     As for the parties’ indirect contributions, I accepted that both parties did their respective parts in providing for the family; the wife with the taking of loans to ensure that payments were made for various family expenses for the welfare of the family and some form of indirect financial contributions to the family. On the facts of this case, on a wider spectrum and based on its unique facts, the wife’s indirect contribution surpassed the husband’s especially since he was overseas for a number of years, leaving her to manage the home as well as the children. I also considered the length of the marriage, the husband’s non-disclosure following discovery orders and issues with his income declaration as well as the needs of the minor children. I was minded to attribute a percentage of 70% to the wife for her indirect contributions (financial and non-financial).

#### Ratio

39     Accordingly, I set out the ratios:

## My orders for division

40     That being the case, the wife is entitled to 75% of the assets of $646,734.30. The amount of $646,734.30 comprises $122,027.53 (joint assets), $374,578.06 (wife’s net assets) and $150,128.71 (husband’s net assets). Her 75% share is $485,050.73. The assets in her name are $374,578.06 and she is therefore entitled to another $110,472.67 which shall be taken from the joint assets of $122,027.53. The husband’s 25% share is $161,683.58 satisfied with him retaining $150,128.71 of assets in his sole name and being entitled to $11,554.87 from the joint assets.

41     As both parties agreed that they owe monies to the wife’s sisters which were to be repaid from the sale of the former matrimonial property, I agreed with the wife that the stakeholding amount to be released to the wife to pay the joint liabilities. Each party’s half share is $123,565.61. The wife having paid $110,472.67 (see paragraph 40), the balance due from her is $13,092.94 which she will pay her sisters directly. The husband’s half share is $123,565.61 less $11,554.87 (from the joint assets) = $112,101.74 which he is to pay to the wife in 3 equal monthly instalments of $37,336.91 per month on the 1st day of every month on 1 September 2019, 1 October 2019 and 1 November 2019. In default thereof any one instalment, the whole sum shall become due and payable and the wife shall be entitled to claim interest on the unpaid sum until full repayment.

## Costs

42     On the issue of costs, the wife claimed costs because the husband filed 2 affidavits without leave and then sought leave at the AM hearing. I allowed the affidavits because they were relevant but agreed with the wife that the matters in the affidavit eg the one filed on 27 June 2019 could have been filed earlier or raised in in his AM affidavits. On the whole, the husband’s conduct left much to be desired – lack of compliance with discovery orders, not paying the ordered maintenance, inadequate submission and last minute filing of affidavits. I therefore awarded costs to the wife totalling $3,500.
