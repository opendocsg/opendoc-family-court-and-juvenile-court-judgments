Family law – Variation of order – Relocation

15 January 2020

### District Judge Guy Ghazali:

## Introduction

1       Central to the present application is the only child of the marriage, \[E\], female, 10 years old. The child is attending Grade 5 in an international school in Singapore.

2       FC/SUM 3434/2019 is the Defendant-Father’s (“the Father”) application for variation of the Order of Court dated 14 November 2018 (“the 2018 Order”).

3       Pursuant to the 2018 Order, both parties have joint custody and shared care and control of \[E\]. Under the shared care and control order, \[E\] spends time with the Father from Wednesday after school until Saturday 5 pm and with the Plaintiff-Mother (“the Mother”) from Saturday 5 pm until Wednesday when she goes to school (except that if Wednesday is a non-schooling day, parties will agree on a suitable handover time). As for \[E\]’s summer and winter holidays, these are shared equally between the Father and the Mother. In the context of my present orders, it is relevant to note that for the upcoming summer holidays in 2020, the Mother will have the first half while the Father will have the second half of the holidays.

4       It may be useful at this juncture to understand the circumstances leading to the 2018 Order. Without going into the details or the parties’ differing positions leading up to the 2018 Order, the Mother’s access to \[E\] prior to the 2018 Order can be summarised as follows:

> (i)     there was an abrupt loss of physical time between the Mother and \[E\] in February 2016 (at that time the marriage was still subsisting and the family was living together);

> (ii)     between August 2016 and February 2017, access between the Mother and \[E\] was intermittent;

> (iii)     between February 2017 and the 2018 Order, the Mother had access to \[E\] every weekend from Saturday at 10 am to Sunday at 7 pm.

5       In determining the Mother’s application, which led to the 2018 Order, the court had directed for and relied on a Custody Evaluation Report.

6       Both parties did not appeal against the 2018 Order.

7       As at the time of my present orders, the shared care and control arrangement has been in place for slightly over a year.

## The parties’ marital status

8       The Father and the Mother are now divorced. They have obtained a divorce order from the Swedish courts on 22 June 2017. At present, they are in the midst of resolving the ancillary financial matters in the Swedish courts.

9       The Father has remarried with one child, aged 2 years. The Father is in Singapore on an Employment Pass. His present wife and the two children (including \[E\]) are on Dependant Passes.

10     The Mother has also remarried. Her present husband is a British citizen working in Singapore on an Employment Pass. The Mother was previously on a Long Term Visit Pass but is presently on a Dependant Pass.

## The Father’s application in FC/SUM 3434/2019

11     In the present application, the Father has applied for an order that he be permitted to relocate/return to Sweden for the reason that his work assignment in Singapore would be ending on 31 December 2019.

12     In support of his application, the Father highlighted the following facts:

> (1)     Both the Father and the Mother are Swedish citizens.

> (2)     Parties were married in Sweden and obtained their divorce in Sweden. They are also in the midst of resolving the ancillary financial matters in the Swedish courts.

> (3)     \[E\] was born in Sweden and is a Swedish citizen. \[E\] spent the first 5 years of her life living in Sweden. If a relocation order is allowed, \[E\] will be returning to her home country.

> (4)     The parties and \[E\] moved to Singapore in September 2014 when \[E\] was 5 years old. The Father was placed on a 3-year work assignment in Singapore. At the end of the 3-year period, the Father was offered the choice of remaining in Singapore for another two years or to return to Sweden. The Father took up the 2-year extension, commencing 15 September 2017. In September 2019, the Father’s contract was further extended but only for 3.5 months until 31 December 2019. It is the Father’s evidence that his employer intends to replace his Singapore role with a “locally hired replacement” and he has to therefore return to resume work in Sweden. To-date, the Father has not been able to secure alternative employment that will allow him to remain in Singapore and receive the same benefits that are extended to him by his present employer.

> (5)     \[E\] has a strong connection to Sweden. She spends almost all her holidays (including her holidays with the Mother) in Sweden.

> (6)     \[E\]’s extended family network is located in Sweden including her paternal grandparents whom she is close to and her maternal grandparents.

> (7)     \[E\] has studied Swedish at the Swedish Supplementary School while in Singapore. She is also familiar with Swedish culture and traditions.

> (8)     He has a close relationship with \[E\] and was \[E\]’s sole caregiver from February 2016 until the 2018 Order. \[E\] also has a close relationship with the Father’s present wife whom the Father married in October 2017 and their child. It is the Father’s contention that it is important for this family unit to be preserved.

> (9)     \[E\] is studying in an international school in Singapore. Her friends are expatriate children who have no permanence in Singapore. For example, two of her best friends have left Singapore to return to their home countries.

> (10)     He has secured accommodation in Sweden. He has signed the lease for the family’s apartment, which will be ready for occupation from 2 January 2020.

> (11)     He has secured a place for \[E\] in an international school in Stockholm, which offers the International Baccalaureate (“IB”) curriculum, in the English stream class with Swedish as second language. As \[E\]’s present school also offers IB curriculum, \[E\]’s transition into school in Sweden will be seamless.

> (12)     The relationship between \[E\] and the Mother will be maintained. They are able to keep in touch through online communications. The Mother travels frequently to Sweden. The Mother is not working and has the means to travel to Sweden to spend time with \[E\]. The Father is prepared to allow the Mother reasonable time to spend with \[E\] during \[E\]’s school breaks (other than the summer and winter holidays which are to be shared equally) and school term. The Father is also prepared to facilitate daily communication between the Mother and \[E\] via telephone, Skype or other electronic means (subject to \[E\]’s schedule and the time zone of the country that \[E\] is in).

> (13)     It is unclear whether the Mother will remain in Singapore in the long-term. The Mother is on a Dependant Pass in Singapore, relying on her present husband’s employment and immigration status (her husband is on Employment Pass). The Mother’s present husband is able to return to and/or work in Europe, having previously worked there.

> (14)     Unlike in Sweden, there is no extended family support in Singapore.

## The Mother’s position

13     The Mother’s primary objections can be summarised as follows.

14     It is the Mother’s position that it is in \[E\]’s best interest that she remains in Singapore as \[E\] has been living here for the past 5 years and is accustomed to life in Singapore. \[E\] is presently studying in the final year of elementary school, which will conclude in June 2020, and will be progressing to middle school thereafter. \[E\] has close friends in Singapore. It is the Mother’s case that there should be stability and continuity for \[E\] and those will be served by having \[E\] remain in Singapore.

15     It is also the Mother’s position that she and her present husband have formed the intention to establish roots in Singapore. In this regard, the Mother’s present husband has applied for Singapore permanent residence in October 2019. He is also on a local permanent contract. According to the Mother, both she and her present husband are committed to ensuring that \[E\] continues to thrive in Singapore. Her present husband is prepared to move to a cheaper accommodation in order to fund \[E\]’s international school fees in Singapore in the event that the Father is unable to afford them. \[E\] is also covered under the Mother’s present husband’s health insurance coverage.

16     The Mother further highlights that save for the period between February 2016 and the 2018 Order, she has been \[E\]’s primary caregiver. If an order for relocation is allowed, there will not only be a loss of relationship between the Mother and \[E\] (which has only recently been restored by the 2018 Order) but \[E\] will also be deprived of the shared care and control arrangement.

17     It is the Mother’s contention that the Father’s reason to relocate is to mainly serve his own career interests and therefore cannot be considered to be reasonable. The Mother submits that the Father has not made sufficient efforts to seek alternative employment to be able to remain in Singapore including the possibility of accepting a local terms contract instead of an expatriate package.

18     In the interest of completeness, I should add that the Mother has raised issues as to whether the school that the Father has secured in Sweden is suitable for \[E\]. However, in my view, the issue of _choice of school_ is a neutral factor for present purposes considering that both parties have joint custody of the child and are jointly responsible to make major decisions for the child such as education.

## Wishes of the child

19     The parties are in dispute as to what the wishes of the child are.

20     To ascertain the child’s wishes, I have directed for an interview with the child, jointly conducted with a court counsellor. In making my present orders, I have taken into account my observations from the joint child interview.

## My decision

21     It has been stated in the Court of Appeal case of _BNS v BNT_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGCA 23</span> that “in considering relocation applications, the welfare of the child is paramount and this principle ought to override any other consideration”. Accordingly, in determining this relocation application, I have directed my mind to and am guided by the principle of the welfare of the child.

22     In determining the welfare of the child, the court considers all relevant facts and circumstances of the case.

23     Having considered the facts and circumstances of this matter, I am of the view that the welfare of \[E\] warrants a relocation order.

24     I start first with the reasonableness of the Father’s wish to relocate. Having considered the evidence, I do not consider the wishes of the Father to relocate to be unreasonable. Both the parties and the child are Swedish citizens. They were living in Sweden until September 2014 when the family moved to Singapore as the Father was assigned to work here. At all material times, parties were aware that their stay in Singapore was going to be temporary. The Father’s assignment in Singapore has now come to an end and he wishes to return to Sweden and to continue to work in Sweden which will allow him to receive similar benefits that he is presently enjoying. While the Mother has submitted that the Father could have taken on a local package to remain in Singapore, I note that even this approach is taken, there is no certainty or guarantee that this will be a long-term arrangement or whether it will merely serve to extend what is always intended to be a temporary stay.

25     While both parties have now remarried and are living in Singapore, they have not established any clear permanence or roots in Singapore. The Father continues to hold an Employment Pass even though he has been here for 5 years. His present wife and his two children (including \[E\]) are on Dependant Passes. As for the Mother, she was on a Long Term Visit Pass and is now on a Dependant Pass. Although she claims that her present husband is on a local contract, he remains on an Employment Pass. While the Mother has averred that her present husband has applied for Singapore permanent residence, it is not clear on evidence whether or when that application will be approved.

26     I have also considered the Mother’s argument that it is against the interest of the child to deprive the child of the shared care and control arrangement under the 2018 Order, which has been effective in restoring the relationship between the Mother and \[E\], after their physical separation in February 2016. This argument, I acknowledge, is a very compelling one.

27     I now turn to my observations of the joint child interview. I gather from the child interview that the child is accustomed to life in Singapore. She is familiar with her present routines and living arrangements. She has close friends whom she will miss dearly if she leaves Singapore. These factors point towards a desire to remain in Singapore. However, my most significant takeaway from the child interview is the child’s need for the physical presence of both her parents. It is clear to me that she is close to both her parents, loves her parents deeply and acknowledges that both her parents care a lot for her.

28     I therefore conclude that it is in the best interest of the child for the child to continue to benefit from the shared care and control arrangement under which she will enjoy the physical presence of and the love and attention from both her parents. In my view, this outcome can be achieved by having the child relocate to Sweden rather than to remain in Singapore.

29     It serves both the short-term and the long-term interests of the child for the child to return to her home country. Even though adjustments are to be expected, returning to her home country will provide the child with greater certainty and permanence. The child is also familiar with her relatives in Sweden such as her maternal and paternal grandparents. More importantly, I am of the view that being a Swedish citizen herself who has been living in Sweden until September 2014, it is not implausible for the Mother to move back to Sweden to resume her life in Sweden. This will enable the Mother to continue to physically care for the child and for the child to have both her parents present in her life as she enters her adolescent years. If I disallow the relocation, the child will lose the continuity of physical care from the Father who has been a constant in her life since her birth. It is also unclear at present whether the Mother and her present husband will be residing in Singapore in the long-term or whether they too will have to relocate back to Sweden or other parts of Europe in the near future. In the event that the Mother and her present husband will also have to relocate, it may be too late at that juncture to restore the loss of physical time between the Father and the child.

30     As for the timing of the relocation, I am of the view that it is in the best interest of the child for the relocation to take place only after the conclusion of the present academic year in her present school. This will give the child time to prepare herself, in particular, for the eventuality of having to leave her friends. This will also give the Mother ample time to make the necessary arrangements if she too wishes to return to her home country in light of the relocation order.

31     In the circumstances, I am ordering for the relocation to take place during the Father’s Summer 2020 holiday time with the child. This will allow the Mother to have her holiday time with the child (which will take place in the first half of the holidays) without disruption.

32     As for the orders consequential to the relocation, considering that the Mother may also return to Sweden, the 2018 Order relating to joint custody and shared care and control (including summer and winter holiday time) shall remain. I am also including an additional clause to the effect that pending the relocation, the child shall be with the Mother (in Singapore) in the event that the Father has to relocate first before the ordered period. This is intended to cover a situation where the Father’s work demands require him to return to Sweden earlier.

33     My orders are therefore as follows:

> a)     The Father is permitted to relocate with \[E\] to Sweden.

> b)     The relocation shall take place during the Father’s Summer 2020 holiday time with \[E\], as provided under the 2018 Order.

> c)     For the avoidance of doubt, the relocation order does not affect the 2018 Order in respect of joint custody, shared care and control and parties’ summer and winter holiday time with the child, which shall continue to stand pending and after the relocation.

> d)     The above order is made on the premise that the Mother will return to Sweden. In the event that the Mother decides not to return to Sweden, either party is at liberty to take out a further application to vary the 2018 Order.

> e)     Pending the relocation, in the event that the Father is not in Singapore during his specified time with \[E\] under the 2018 Order, \[E\] shall be with the Mother.

> f)     Both parties shall facilitate and not obstruct \[E\]’s communication with the other parent by telephone or electronic means.

> g)     There shall be liberty to apply.

> h)     There shall no order as to costs. \[It is noted that the Father prayed for no order as to costs in his Summons.\]

## FC/SUM 3952/2019

34     For completeness, I would add that the Mother has filed an application in FC/SUM 3952/2019 seeking a variation of the 2018 order i_n the event that the Father’s relocation application is not allowed_. In light of my order allowing relocation, I made no orders on the Mother’s application.
