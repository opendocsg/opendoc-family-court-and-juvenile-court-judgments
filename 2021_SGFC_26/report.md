Family law – Relocation

16 March 2021

### District Judge Kathryn Thong:

## Introduction

1       This was the Mother’s application to relocate to Luxembourg with parties’ only child whom I shall refer to as ‘Dilan’. Dilan was 12 years old at the time of the hearing, and had already completed his Primary School Leaving Examination (“PSLE”).

2       The Mother’s relocation was motivated by her job loss in Singapore. As an IT consultant, her training was in a specific software which was no longer required in Singapore but for which, her prospective employer in Luxembourg valued.

3       Apart from the relocation, the Mother also prayed for the monthly child maintenance to be increased from $1,000 to $4,000 or alternatively, a lump sum be paid.

4       The Father initially agreed to the relocation but changed his mind when the Mother insisted that he should continue to maintain their son. He then took out a cross-summons to reverse care and control to him and for the monthly maintenance to be reduced from $1,000 to $300.

5       In resisting her application, the Father submitted that the Mother was unsuitable to have care and control of Dilan, as she had clearly not raised him well. Amongst other things, he took issue with his son’s lacklustre academic performance, inability to speak Hindi fluently and overall physical fitness.

6       I eventually dismissed the Father’s application to reverse care and control to him, granted the Mother’s relocation application and reduced the monthly child maintenance to $650.

7       I had found that there was no material change in circumstances to alter the status quo in the care and control arrangements, nor had the Father demonstrated that it would be in Dilan’s best interests to be in his care.

8       As for the maintenance, the Mother had provided no objective basis for the staggering increment to $4,000 and I was of the view that a ballpark figure of $650 would suffice given that education was subsidised in Luxembourg, and pertinently, her financial circumstances had improved since the award of child maintenance was first made in 2014. Besides, Dilan had not yet moved to Luxembourg and any estimate of his expenses would largely be speculative.

9       I also made orders on other miscellaneous prayers in the Father’s summons.

10     Both parties have appealed against my decision.

## Background facts

11     Both parties are Singapore Permanent Residents, and Dilan is an Indian citizen. The parents were married in 2007 and interim judgment was granted in 2012. Yet, the ancillary matters took some four years to conclude. In _TAG v TAH_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 25</span>, the learned District Judge Sharon Lim (“DJ Lim”) who presided over the ancillary matters observed at \[7\]:

>     The divorce proceedings have taken more than 4 years thus far due to the parties’ entrenched positions and highly litigious approach. The issue of whether the divorce should be granted at all was hotly contested, alongside all related issues of jurisdiction, maintenance, family violence and other applications. The ancillary matters were likewise heatedly contested.

12     DJ Lim observed the following at \[13\] of her grounds:

>     For most of \[Dilan’s\] life, he has lived solely with his mother with unfortunately little contact with his father. Without going into attributing whose fault it was for the limited contact with the father, it patently clear to me that it would not be in the child’s welfare to uproot him from a living arrangement he has been used to for some time and place him in a new home, as the husband is submitting. _In my view, the more critical step to take was to first facilitate the re-establishment of the bond between the husband and the child._ In the meantime, the child should remain under the care of the wife, which is the arrangement he is used to. I agreed with the wife’s counsel that this would ensure stability for the child given his young age. However, the wife also had to realise that it was in the child’s best interests to have a good parental relationship with the husband as well and facilitate regular access.

>     \[own emphasis\]

13     Some five years on after the ancillary matters had concluded, it appeared that little had changed between parties, with the Father complaining of difficulties with seeing Dilan despite living a 10 minutes’ walking distance from him.

## Parties’ respective cases

14     The Mother explained that her relocation was for genuine reasons. It was in Dilan’s best interests as she could no longer find a job in Singapore and the Luxembourg job offer would provide her and Dilan financial security, especially when she had had to repeatedly take out enforcement applications against the Father for defaulting on maintenance.

15     She had been previously working as an ‘application support’ for software used in private equity and alternative investments. The software was used mainly in Europe and the US, but rarely in Asia and her training was so specialised she had to travel to Switzerland for a 3-month training programme.

16     Unfortunately, the company migrated to a new software and in May 2020 her contract was no longer renewed. She thus lost her gross income of $7,500 though she received her performance bonus in June 2020, as well as her cash in lieu of outstanding leave.

17     Since March 2020, being aware of her impending departure from her company, she had been searching for jobs and the Mother exhibited her various job applications in her affidavit. Unfortunately, her efforts were futile until she was headhunted for the prospective role in Luxembourg.

18     This was a very attractive job offer with 35.5 days of leave, a monthly salary of $9,500, comprehensive medical coverage and preferential rates for loans just to name a few benefits. She had shortlisted six schools for Dilan in Luxembourg and she would rent an apartment in the city centre or somewhere close to Dilan’s school.

19     Overall, the Mother was convinced was that relocation was in Dilan’s best interests. While Singapore was where Dilan had grown up in, Luxembourg was a safe country and had an excellent standard of living. Besides, it would not prejudice the Father because the Mother claimed he never had a relationship with Dilan anyway, and much ink was spilled on how the Father had left the matrimonial home when Dilan was 2 years old, and through the years, was never there for Dilan as a father. For all his claims of wanting to see Dilan, she pointed out that despite his alleged issues with access, had never bothered to take out an application to see Dilan. It thus appeared that the Father was simply objecting to the relocation because she refused to relent on the issue of maintenance.

20     The Father asserted that it would not be in Dilan’s best interests to travel to Luxembourg for three reasons: a) the Mother’s “extreme greed for money and hatred” towards him and his family; (b) the Mother had made his access to the child extremely difficult and (c) the Mother’s “total neglect” towards child.

21     As regards (a), the Father described the Mother as being disdainful of the diamond ring he had gotten her for their marriage, instead of buying her a Solitaire diamond – which he wound up buying eventually. He complained of how during the marriage, she had demanded jewellery from him and he would accede to such demands. Further, just before Dilan was born, the Mother had removed all their jewellery, worth some $40,000, from their jointly held safe deposit box and transferred it to a new safe deposit box operated by her solely. Through the years, she had been engaging in harassing behaviour, filing applications to vary the maintenance upwards every few years only for them to be dismissed, and swiftly enforce maintenance orders against him just because he was late in paying maintenance. He had paid around $120,000 as maintenance for Dilan in the last 10 years and he asked for an accounting of how she had spent these monies.

22     On the issue of access, the Father spoke of how the Mother placed obstacles to access even though he only lived a 10 minutes’ walking distance from him. When Dilan was younger, the Mother would claim Dilan was not ready to meet the Father because of their distant relationship, and he would not get to see him at all. As he grew older, the Mother would make the Father wait sometimes for a whole hour before sending Dilan down for access, or if she felt that the Father was late for access, she would not allow access altogether. Even when the Mother allowed access, he lamented that the helper would tag along and not allow him to get too close to Dilan.

23     The Father was frustrated with the situation and according to him, in January 2017, the Mother stopped his access to Dilan completely on the grounds that the Father did not turn up regularly and on time to exercise his access; she told the Father to proceed to the Court if he so wanted such access.

24     He also claimed to have asked the Mother to allow him to have Dilan to take care of his studies for the next two years and prepare him for the PSLE. The Mother rejected this request. When the Father asked that he contact Dilan directly instead of through the Mother, the Mother asked the Father to purchase a mobile phone for Dilan and declined to give the Father Dilan’s mobile number.

25     In addition, the Mother did not inform the Father of any parent-teacher meetings; did not allow him to celebrate Dilan’s birthdays; did not allow the Father to bring Dilan to any of the birthday parties of the Father’s friends’ children, and disallowed him from visiting the family in India. Allowing the relocation, the Father submitted, would not be in Dilan’s best interests as he would certainly be cut off from Dilan’s life.

26     Suddenly in August 2020, the Father managed to have access to Dilan because the Mother was in his words, showing “mercy” towards him before taking Dilan away to Luxembourg. Even so, the Father bemoaned the Mother’s controlling ways where she would give him instructions on what to do, and even send his schoolwork over for the Father to complete with Dilan. This frustrated the Father who had access to Dilan only Saturdays and he wanted to spend the time engaging in outdoor activities, which he claimed was also Dilan’s wish.

27     As for the Mother’s quality of care towards Dilan, the Father lamented that at 11 plus years old, Dilan was a heavy-set boy at 70kg. He was also doing poorly academically, was addicted to computer gaming and did not engage in any physical activities save for one-off taekwondo and tennis classes. Calling the Mother “the worst mother any child deserves”, the Father stated that Dilan was clearly being neglected by the Mother. It was distressing also to the Father it seemed that Dilan was unable to string a proper sentence in Hindi when he met with him in August 2020. He offered to coach him in Hindi in the evenings but this was rebuffed by the Mother who told him to use his Saturday access time to do so and not disrupt his schedule.

28     The Father also exhibited Dilan’s primary school report cards over several years, where the teachers remarked that Dilan could put in more effort, and had good potential to do better in his studies.

29     It was the Father’s view that given that Dilan had spent all his life in Singapore, uprooting him would not be a good idea since he would have to serve National Service which the Father was desirous of as it instils discipline in boys. Leaving for Luxembourg now would be disruptive and would be hard for him to adjust to the culture again. The Mother did not have Dilan’s best interests in mind and was simply using him to extract more maintenance monies from him as evinced by her prayer for lump sum maintenance. She was not capable of caring for him at all given how he had turned out.

## Parties’ arguments at the hearing

30     At the hearing, the Father who was unrepresented, explained that he should be given the opportunity to have care and control of Dilan. He claimed to have asked Dilan if he would be comfortable staying with him (the Father) for two years, to which Dilan allegedly replied, “I don’t know.” The Father said Dilan was neutral on the issue because he does not know what is “right or wrong” and “does not know what \[sic\] the Father is”.

31     In seeking care and control of Dilan, the Father stated he wanted to demonstrate that he could take better care of Dilan than the Mother. He bemoaned how Dilan had no social life, was socially disconnected, hardly had fun and was addicted to his computer games. When the Father took Dilan to play squash at his condo, he was aghast that Dilan could not hold the racquet properly or even raise his leg 30 degrees and expressed cynicism at whatever tennis or taekwondo lessons the Mother may have sent him for. He alleged that the teachers told him that should Dilan continue with his lifestyle, he could become depressed and entertain suicidal thoughts. The teachers had even opined Dilan was “headed for disaster”. For all his claims of what the teachers purportedly told him, the Father produced no evidence to support them.

32     The Father submitted that if Dilan failed to improve academically under his care and failed to become healthier, he would let him go to Luxembourg if that was indeed better for Dilan. In the Father’s words: “I took it as a challenge.” He would also ask his mother to come over from India to help care for Dilan. Further, as a product manager in an international bank where he was drawing an income of some $9,000 per month, he had flexible hours to care for Dilan. He believed that he could turn Dilan around in 6 months, and now that Dilan was approaching his teen years, it was imperative that he had a father’s guidance. In particular, the Father emphasised NS as instilling discipline in him, and how as a Singapore Permanent Resident, Dilan would need to serve NS.

33     Counsel for the Mother, Mr Singh, retorted that the Father himself did not even serve NS, and had in fact rejected the Mother’s application for Permanent Resident (“PR”) status years ago but for which, she would have been a PR today. It was thus bewildering where this preoccupation with NS was coming from and he opined that the Father was suggesting that one would be a failure in life if he did not serve NS.

34     It was also strange that after 6 years of neglect of his son, the Father was now positing that he was prepared to do anything for Dilan. In fact, Mr Singh contended, the Father did not even share with the Mother the school’s concerns that Dilan might be suicidal, making one wonder if he really had Dilan’s best interests at heart. The Father countered he failed to do so because he believed the Mother would be outraged at the suggestion and besides, the teachers had merely said Dilan might develop suicidal tendencies if he continued in his ways.

35     The Father submitted that if Dilan were to relocate, he would be out of his life forever. At most, he would only get to see him once a year, and practically, would not be able to talk much to him. He also pointed out that the Mother had no support in Luxembourg and Dilan would have to speak French there. If he could not even speak Hindi, his mother tongue, how could he be expected to pick up French?

36     Counsel pointed out that English is used in Luxembourg and learning French was something that Dilan could pick up in any event. If the Mother had no income in Singapore, overall, it was in Dilan’s best interests that they relocate. After all, Luxembourg was a country with an excellent standard of living.

## My decision

### No basis for care and control to be reversed to the Father

37     A logically prior issue to the issue of relocation, was whether the Father ought to have care and control of Dilan. The question for this Court was whether there was any material change in circumstances to warrant such a reversal and whether would it be in Dilan’s best interests to be in the Father’s care and control.

38     Much of the Father’s case rested on what he believed to be inferior parenting by the Mother, something he had suddenly become aware of in the recent months because he finally managed to see Dilan in August 2020. When he saw how poorly he spoke Hindi, and how overweight he was, and how he was faring in his academics, it broke his heart. That was when the Father realised he could not let Dilan relocate with the Mother despite his initial consent.

39     Tussles for care and control are often rife with allegations, true or otherwise, of “poor” parenting, and this almost always springs from the subjective views of the accusing parent as to what is “good” parenting. But the Court does not pronounce who is the “better parent” as much as each parent may attempt to seek validation or vindication from the Court’s eventual orders. Clashes in parenting styles are not uncommon and can occur even in functioning marriages. Ultimately, parents know their children best and should figure out what parenting approach best suits their child – there is no universal standard or one size fits all approach. As the High Court observed at \[28\] of _UXH v UXI_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHCF 24</span>:

>     … Barring exceptional circumstances where a parent is unfit, _parents know their child best and are the most suitable persons to make decisions and bear responsibility for their child._ Parenting decisions, even those made after a divorce, should be made by the parents themselves. When parents are unable to reach an agreed arrangement despite their best efforts and they seek the court’s intervention as the last resort, the court will consider all the circumstances to determine what is in the child’s welfare, _but this does not change the reality that the court is not the child’s parent._

>     \[own emphasis\]

40     When parents cannot agree what is in the welfare of the child, and the matter winds up in Court, then the Court will have to embark on an inquiry as the Court of Appeal in _Soon Peck Wah_ exhorted at \[25\]:

>     ...’welfare’ must be taken in its widest sense…the welfare of the child is not to be measured by money only nor by physical comfort only; the moral and religious welfare of the child must be considered as well as his physical well-being; nor can the ties of affection be disregarded. The rights and wishes of parents must be assessed and weighed in their bearing on the welfare of the child in conjunction with all other factors relative to that issue. The question for the judge is not what the essential justice of the case requires but what the best interests of the child requires.

41     And in _VET v VEU_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHCF 4</span> at \[14\], Justice Debbie Ong observed that:

>     A child’s welfare refers to her well-being in every aspect, that is, her well-being in the most exhaustive sense of that word. It refers to her physical, intellectual, psychological, emotional, moral and religious well-being. It refers to her well-being both in the short term and in the long term: _UKM v Attorney-General_ at \[45\]; _TSF v TSE_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 2 SLR 833</span> at \[51\] and \[52\]. Also relevant to a child’s welfare is the need to enable parents to carry out their parental responsibility without unnecessary interference from third parties: _UMF v UMG_ at \[28\] and \[33\].

42     The test is not who is or can be the better parent, but in whose care and control, will the child’s best interests in all aspects, be promoted. In this regard, the Mother has been Dilan’s primary caregiver since birth or at the very least, since he was around 2 years old when the Father left the matrimonial home. Through the years, nothing untoward has occurred to suggest that the Father should replace the Mother as the caregiver.

43     While the Father believed that he will be able to relate better to Dilan than the Mother as Dilan approaches adolescence, there did not appear to be reasonable basis for his belief, as ardent or sincere as it may be. By the Father’s own admission, he has largely been absent from Dilan’s life.

44     The fact that the Father knew little of Dilan’s life was evidenced by the Father’s criticism of the Mother in not sending Dilan for sports activities, which was contradicted by her evidence of signing him up for taekwondo and other sporting activities. These may not have been particularly extensive, but what was apparent from the available evidence was that Dilan appeared to be more into robotics than sports or music and this should not be surprising since he is the offspring of two IT consultants. Yet, much of the Father’s complaint revolved around Dilan’s lack of physical activities, which to my view, underscored his lack of understanding as to Dilan’s predilection.

45     In fact, the Father himself submitted at the hearing that Dilan was upset with him because the Mother had shown him the Father’s affidavits and Dilan found the contents to be untrue of him. I thought this only served to highlight how little the Father knew Dilan.

46     Of course, a father’s presence in any child’s life is important for the healthy development of the child. And as a child enters puberty, he or she may have greater affinity with the parent of the same gender.

47     But without more, such an argument that a child needs a particular parent’s guidance more at certain stages of his or her life, is neither here nor there, if there is nothing concrete to show a real likelihood that a child’s best interests would be promoted by a complete reversal in care and control. There must be compelling evidence – not mere rhetoric – that a change in care and control would be in a child’s best interests. Otherwise, to alter the status quo would be destabilising for a child and wrong in principle. This is why the Courts typically look to the primary caregiver as the more appropriate parent to have care and control because they are typically more attuned towards the child’s needs. As the High Court noted at \[67\] of _AZZ v BAA_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 44</span> in granting the wife in that case care and control:

>     … \[the grant of care and control\]will inevitably endow the wife with substantially greater insight than the husband can ever have about each child’s ever-evolving needs and wants, hopes and fears. That insight will place the wife in a far better position than him to know what will best promote the children’s welfare at any point in time, both in the short-term and for the long-term.

48     Simply because Dilan will soon be a teenager does not mean that the Mother by mere virtue of her gender, will not be able to care for him well. There may be new challenges but the Mother having raised Dilan will be familiar with his temperament and idiosyncrasies and will be well placed to manage whatever problems that come his way. The Father can still offer Dilan guidance through speaking to him, writing to him and calling him. Indeed, there are ways to establish contact through technology and he could even fly over to Luxembourg to see him if he so desired.

49     Overall, it was a superficially attractive suggestion that the Father could mentor Dilan as he grows into a young man, but the Father’s sincere belief was unfortunately not matched by any concrete actions, a point to which I turn to.

50     The Father spoke generally of wanting to organise sporting activities for Dilan to get fitter and healthier, and mentioned a trial ‘white hacker’ class which Dilan had enjoyed and for which he intended to sign him up in the long term once there was an outcome on parties’ applications.

51     But I had real concerns as to whether the Father would execute these plans for Dilan. This is because for the last six years, despite his claims that his access had been beset with difficulties, he had not filed any application to the Court to seek to alter this state of affairs. Not only is he financially capable of seeking assistance from the Court, but back in 2014, DJ Lim noted that one of the Mother’s arguments then was that the Father had not sought any application to the Court for access, suggesting that he was content for the Mother to have care and control of Dilan.

52     If the Father was ignorant then of his rights, he could not say the same now – it was clear to him that he has recourse to the Courts if the Mother was thwarting access. Even he conceded in this hearing that he should have done something earlier about it. He simply proffered that he was weary of the litigation and was so frustrated, that he gave up trying to have access altogether since in 2017.

53     Lest it be suggested that the Court will look askance at a parent who fails to seek redress in the Courts, this is certainly not the case. There may well be eminently sound reasons why a parent consciously chooses not to litigate further in Court, such as avoiding further stress to the child and the family. But in this case, the Father lives within 10 minutes walking distance from Dilan, and it had been found that it was critical for him to build his bond with Dilan.

54     Even if the Mother may have been difficult with physical access, there was a lot the Father could do to establish contact over the years, particularly when he was in close proximity to the Dilan. For one, he could have sought remote access. While the Father was well entitled to disagree with the Mother’s suggestion of buying a phone to contact Dilan directly, in eventually refusing to do so, might it be said that he had thrown the baby out with the bathwater, therefore diminishing his chances of having any remote access?

55     At the time of the hearing, the PSLE exams had been over since 7 October. The Father had flexible hours working from home, and was living a stone’s throw from Dilan. Yet at the hearing, he said he had no idea what Dilan was getting up to, as he only sees him once a week on Saturdays. I found this somewhat disappointing. The fact was that the circumstances were conducive for the Father to work on Dilan’s development now that the PSLE was over. Further, since he thought the Mother was being deliberately generous with access before leaving for Luxembourg, it was open to him to seek more access to Dilan.

56     Yet, the Father did not have anything firm lined up; for instance, the tennis lessons he said, would be booked once the Court ruled on parties’ applications. But he could have leveraged on the opportunities presented to him then to bond with Dilan, _regardless_ of the outcome.

57     I was thus not optimistic that the Father would carry out what he intended to do. With respect, if for the last six years nothing had been done to ameliorate the access issues he had with Dilan in or out of Court, there was very little for this Court to go on, to believe that in the immediate to long-term future, the Father would be attending to his needs in the manner he described.

58     But even if the Court was persuaded for a moment that the Father would execute his well-meaning plans for Dilan, there was a concern that the Father appeared to have very fixed ideas of what it means to be doing well in life. While he is entitled to hold such views, it is important that a parent’s view of success in life does not inadvertently result in a child feeling like he or she is a failure in life because he/she is unable to achieve their parents’ definition of success.

59     Here, the Father believed he could get Dilan into shape in six months and get him off his computer addiction and lead a healthier lifestyle. His description of how Dilan could not hold a squash racquet and such, demonstrated that he had a very dim view of Dilan’s current physical state and academics.

60     I accept that Dilan’s current state may be worrisome for some parents, but the rather dogmatic manner in which the approached his case for care and control, gave cause for concern that he might end up imposing expectations on Dilan which Dilan may not want to, or be able to achieve.

61     To care for a child does not mean to mould the child into the person that the parents want him/her to be, but to give the child latitude to become the person that he can and wants to be. There is nothing wrong with seeking the best for one’s child but every parent must consider the child’s abilities and strengths, inclinations and preferences, weaknesses and limitations, personality and temperament. And this requires an intimate understanding of one’s child, which I was not confident the Father had, given that he has had such little contact with Dilan over the last six years and even now, did not appear to be proactive in nurturing the bond.

62     The Father’s allegation that the teachers warned him of potential dire consequences should have meant there was even more impetus for the Father to quickly seek to rectify the situation but there was no evidence that he had set anything in motion for Dilan since the exams were over. Further, he did not even tell the Mother of the teacher’s concerns simply because he believed the Mother would end up berating him.

63     In any event, at the end of the day, at twelve years old, Dilan would not have the same malleability as when he was six. Even if the Father had carried out his plans for Dilan, he may not succeed in meeting the Father’s expectations and hopes for him. This was also a scenario contemplated by the Father who conceded that if after 2 years, Dilan did not wish to remain in his care and control, he could head to Luxembourg to be with the Mother.- I found that having such a probationary period this was not in Dilan’s best interest as the effect would be that Dilan would not be cared for by his primary caregiver during the period. This might also place further undue stress on Dilan who would be faced with the situation where his “performance” in the next two years might affect his future care-giving.

64     In sum, I did not find that it would be in the best interests for care and control to be given to the Father as the Father was not familiar with Dilan’s needs; the Father appeared to have a fixed mindset as to how Dilan should be like and look like, which would not only be unhealthy for the Father-son bond but could be damaging for Dilan; there was no basis for the Court to be persuaded that the Father has proper long term care plans which he will actually execute, and finally, no evidence of such a strong bond between Father and son that suggested Dilan’s best interests would be promoted in his care.

65     Further, his care plans included calling his elderly mother over from India, who has had little to no interaction with Dilan throughout these years. For the foregoing reasons, I found it to be in the best interests for Dilan to remain in the Mother’s care and control.

### Best interests of Dilan to relocate with the Mother

66     I now turn to the Mother’s prayer for relocation. In _UYK v UYJ_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHCF 9</span>, Debbie Ong J observed at \[25\]-\[26\]:

>     …relocation inevitably presents competing tensions between the interests of parents: if the court refuses the relocation application, the custodial parent is tied down to Singapore even if he or she no longer wishes to remain in Singapore, whereas if the court allows the relocation, the quantity and quality of contact that the child has with the left-behind parent may be drastically reduced (see _BNS_ at \[2\]).

>     … _TAA_ and _BNS_ emphasised, however, that the ultimate enquiry must be whether relocation is in the child’s welfare, and in considering this question, sufficient recognition must also be accorded to the loss of relationship a child may experience with the left-behind parent. This, however, should _not_ be read to mean that the loss of relationship in itself has become the dominant or determinant consideration (see _BNS_ at \[26\]).

67     In the present case, the Mother has had to relocate due to her loss of employment. Remaining in Singapore with no other personal source of income, and no support, means she is worse off remaining in Singapore than going to Luxembourg. Though the Father shared his concerns that the Mother has no support over there, this is a neutral factor at best. As DJ Lim noted in her grounds of decision for the ancillary matters, parties have no roots in Singapore – their roots are in India. So anywhere the Mother relocates to, so long as it is not in India, she will not have that family support, and hence, she is no better supported in Singapore in my view, than in Luxembourg.

68     As for learning new languages in Luxembourg, that will be something that Dilan will have to adjust to. On this point, I’m given to understand that English is also used in Luxembourg and the mother will be trying to enrol him in a school where English is the primary language used.

69     As for the Father’s submission that with the relocation he will be unable to have access and will ultimately lose his son, generous access terms can mitigate the loss of relationship as stated by the High Court in _UYK v UYJ_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHCF 9</span>, and it is also open to the Father to move closer to Dilan. Further, Dilan is now older and can voice his views as to overnight access and overseas access and the Father can work something out directly with Dilan, something which I intimated to Mr Singh, who agreed, would be helpful. At the risk of belabouring the point, I did not think the father-son relationship would be severely impacted by the relocation given the existing state of affairs. Taking all factors into consideration, it was ultimately in Dilan’s best interests to head to Luxembourg with his primary caregiver, his mother.

70     Aside from the relocation orders, I also made further orders for the Mother to furnish the Father with Dilan’s mobile number for the purpose of the Father contacting Dilan in Luxembourg within 7 days of arriving in Luxembourg and in the meantime, to immediately provide the Father with the mobile phone number that Dilan was using in Singapore.

71     I also made the following access orders, several of which mirrored the prayers sought by the Mother herself:

> i.     The Father shall be at liberty to have access, including overnight access, to Dilan in Luxembourg subject to giving 2 weeks’ written notice to the Mother.

> ii.     For avoidance of doubt, the Father shall be at liberty to have access to Dilan for the period that Dilan is settling into his new environment, and to be present for any orientation and related activities where parents are to be involved. The Mother shall not impose any restrictions on the Father’s involvement in such activities.

> iii.     In addition, the Father shall have remote access to Dilan through any video conferencing platform and/or other electronic modes of communication, and the Father shall be responsible for initiating such contact with Dilan directly.

> iv.     The Mother shall as far as is reasonably practicable, facilitate the communication between the Father and child, and shall not unreasonably restrict such communication.

> v.     Further, the Mother shall provide, on a quarterly basis and only upon the Father’s request, information as to Dev’s progress in school.

> vi.     The Mother shall also provide to the Father, access to any online portal for the sharing of Dev’s progress in school.

> vii.     The Mother shall bring the child back to Singapore at least once a year, for at least 2 weeks during the child’ school holidays or otherwise, and shall inform the Father at least 1 month in writing of her intention to do so.

> viii.     While the child is in Singapore, the Father shall have liberal access, including overnight and overseas access, to Dilan.

> ix.     For overseas travel, the Mother shall hand over the passport of the child to the Father at least 3 days prior to the commencement of the intended date for travel. The Father shall return the passport to the Mother within 3 days after returning from the overseas trip.

> x.     For all physical access, be it in Singapore or otherwise, the Father shall be responsible for proposing the timings, venue and duration of such access to the Mother, and such proposals are to be made at least 2 weeks before the intended date of exercise.

> xi.     All physical access duration shall be for at least 2 hours.

> xii.     Where physical access is unable to take place at all for whatever reason, the Father shall be entitled to “make up” access on such other time and date as may be agreed between parties.

72     These terms were generous in my view and envisaged the Father having physical access to Dilan should he choose to fly over. Based on the Father’s self-declared income of $9,000 per month, I did not think affordability would be an issue for the Father to fly over.

73     As requested by Mr Singh, I also made further orders for the Father to sign all necessary forms to effect Dilan’s relocation and for all travels, where the Father’s signature may be required. Where the travel pertained to a jurisdiction outside Singapore or Luxembourg, the Mother would have to give the Father at least two weeks’ notice of the need for his signature, and also provide the reasons for such travel.

74     The Father bristled at these orders as he did not consent to the relocation to begin with. I explained to him that the withholding of his consent may result in Dilan being unable to travel within the European Union or outside it, and he ought to consider if this would be Dilan’s best interests. While I understand that the Father could not bring himself to give consent for the relocation and all other travel, insofar as it remained a technical requirement for his signature to be given before Dilan could travel, there was no basis for him to refuse it as the Mother had care and control of Dilan. Withholding such consent would thwart the Mother’s travel plans and unduly restrict hers and Dilan’s ability to travel. At the same time, I urged Mr Singh also to check if it was truly necessary to procure the Father’s signature, given the Court order decreeing the Mother as the care and control parent.

### Maintenance for Dilan to be reduced

75     It will be recalled that the Mother sought an upward increase to $4,000 for Dilan’s maintenance or in the alternative, a lump sum up to the age of 18 years or 21 years. Such a lump sum would come up to almost half a million dollars.

76     Although Mr Singh clarified the prayer was for maintenance in Singapore, I did not see any basis for such a huge increase, regardless of whether she remained in Singapore or otherwise. It amounted to more than 50% of her last drawn salary of $7,500 and it was baffling that Dilan being a normal child without special needs, would incur such huge expenses.

77     Further, as the Father pointed out, the maintenance was to be borne solely by him back in 2014 due to the disparity in parties’ incomes back then. Now, the Mother’s salary would be $9,500, and although she produced belatedly the taxes she would have to pay once she moved over to Luxembourg, it was not entirely clear how this would impact her monthly disposable income. There was also no evidence as to the Father’s monthly salary which he declared to be $9,000.

78     Nonetheless, it appeared that the gap between both parties’ incomes had narrowed much since the 2014 order and even appeared to be on par with each other. There was a case for both to now share in Dilan’s maintenance. After all, it is trite that maintenance is the joint duty of both parents.

79     I considered the undisputed fact that on top of the maintenance that the Mother had been receiving through the years, she had also been keeping the rental monies of two rooms she was renting out in the matrimonial home, and this arrangement would be continue in all likelihood. Dilan’s medical expenses would also be covered by her employer. It was also not disputed by Mr Singh that education in Luxembourg as pointed out by the Father, was free or heavily subsidised.

80     In my view, there was a material change in circumstances from the time the child maintenance award was first made in 2014. All things considered and given the lack of evidence on parties’ means and Dilan’s expenses, I reduced the maintenance with effect from November 2020 from $1,000 to $650 per month, instead of the $300 that the Father sought. This final figure of $650 was very much a ballpark figure owing to the lack of evidence.

## Miscellaneous prayers

81     I turn now to the other prayers in the Father’s summons in SUM 3093/2020:

> (a)     Defendant to refund $700 a month maintenance for the child effective 1-November-2014 until the conclusion of this application. As of now, it is $50,400;

> (b)     Defendant to pay the rental accrued until now of the Certis Cisco Safe Deposit Box xxx at Redhill and to close this account;

> (c)     Defendant to remove the family name of ‘xxx’ from her name that she had got after the wedding or pay $1,000 a month effective immediately until removed.

82     Regarding the issue of the $700 refund, this arose from the Father’s position that Dilan’s maintenance at the material time of the ancillary matters, could not have been more than $600 per month. His share of the maintenance then, based on equal sharing between him and the Mother, would be $300. This was considering the fact that the Mother was keeping the full sum of rental monies from renting out two rooms in the matrimonial home. Hence, the Mother owed him $1,000 minus $300, _i.e_. $700. At the hearing I pointed out to the Father that he could have taken out this application years ago and it was in my view, unfair and prejudicial to the Mother for him to now seek a clawback of such monies - such monies would have already been expended on Dilan.

83     As for the arrears accrued for the safe deposit box, the Father claimed that the Mother had emptied out the joint safe deposit box of all jewellery but failed to close the account. He only found out about this when he was contacted by Certis Cisco who were chasing him for payment of the annual rental which was $163. They told him the invoices for the safe deposit box had been sent to the matrimonial home which the Father knew nothing of. Mr Singh did not dispute this was a joint account. Accordingly, I found that the rental monies would be a joint liability since it was procured during the marriage and in both parties’ names.

84     I thus ordered for the Father to terminate the rental immediately and for all outstanding rental and termination fees and associated expenses to be borne equally between the parties. The Father would pay these fees upfront and seek reimbursement from the Mother who shall reimburse the Father within 14 days of the supporting proof being furnished to her failing which, the Father would be entitled to set off these expenses from the maintenance for Dilan.

85     Regarding this set off, I wish to point out that the nature of these expenses are wholly different from that of a child’s maintenance and ordinarily, matrimonial liabilities should not be set-off in such a manner. However, I considered the practical difficulties of the Father recovering monies from the Mother should she fail to comply with the orders, which would be compounded by her relocation. I also weighed this up against the prejudice that might be caused if the Mother should have to forgo Dilan’s maintenance - at $650 in monthly maintenance against the $163 annual rental, even if the outstanding fees were accrued since 2014 onwards when the ancillary orders were made (which did _not_ appear to be the case), at most the Mother would have ‘lost out’ on one month’s maintenance for Dilan which I do not think places her in a financially precarious position.

86     As for the last prayer, I did not think I had jurisdiction to order that the Mother drop the Father’s family name from her name, and/or to pay the Father royalties for continuing to use his family name, as repugnant as it may be to him.

## Conclusion

87     Given the orders I had made, I ordered for each party is bear their own costs, save that the Father was to pay reasonable disbursements for the Mother’s summons in SUM 2520/2020, fixed at $1,500.

88     I wish to state that the orders and observations I have made in these grounds of decision, should not be taken to suggest that the Father does not love Dilan. On the contrary, it is clear that the Father wants the best for Dilan. There are ways to nurture the father-son bond even as Dilan has relocated, and I would like to believe that the Father will do his utmost to preserve his relationship with Dilan and even build on it. After all, Singapore is 7 hours ahead of Luxembourg and with Dilan’s mobile number, I do not see any impediment to the Father contacting him. Dilan is also now older and can reach out to his Father directly.

89     To the extent that the Mother may view the Father as having been lackadaisical in exercising access these years, I must impress upon the Mother that this does not give her superior moral authority over the Father nor any basis to curtail any development of the relationship between Dilan his father.

90     Finally, I urge parties not to burden Dilan with their emotional baggage, for this is most practical way of loving Dilan. Revisiting the unhappy past only takes away from the present.
