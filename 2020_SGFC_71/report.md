Ancillary Matters – Care and control – Division – Wife Maintenance – Child Maintenance

21 August 2020

### District Judge Suzanne Chin:

## Introduction

1       The plaintiff (“the Husband”) and the defendant (“the Wife”) were married on 6 October 2013. This was the second marriage for both of them. The Husband has 2 sons from an earlier marriage while the Wife has a daughter from her earlier marriage. There is one child from this marriage, a son who at the time of the hearing was five and a half years old. The Husband filed for divorce on 6 September 2018 on the grounds of unreasonable behaviour. This was contested by the Wife who filed a counterclaim alleging unreasonable behaviour on the part of the Husband. Eventually however, the parties agreed to proceed with the divorce on an uncontested basis and Interim Judgement was granted on the 22 May 2019 on both the claim and counterclaim.

2       The matter first came before me for hearing of the Ancillary Matters. At the time of the hearing, the Husband was 53 years of age and worked as a manager earning about $8,200 per month while the Wife was 39 years of age and worked as a nurse earning appropriately $4,400 per month. Notwithstanding that parties had tried to settle their issues through mediation, no agreement had been reached on all of the other issues. Accordingly, all issues remained to be determined before the court at the Ancillary Matters hearing.

3       As parties were agreeable to joint custody of the child of the marriage, I recorded a consent order. After hearing from the parties, I made orders on the rest of the issues. All of my orders are listed as follows:

> _“i_.     _By consent there shall be joint custody of the child B._

> _ii_.     _The Defendant shall be granted sole care and control of the child B with access to the Plaintiff as follows:_

>> _a_.     _Every Wednesday from 6.30pm to 9.30pm;_

>> _b_.     _Every Saturday from 10am to Sunday 10pm;_

>> _c_.     _Alternate public holidays from 10am to 9.30pm_

> _iii_.     _Each party shall be allowed to take the child overseas for a holiday once a year for no more than 30 days during the child’s school holidays provided that notice of such overseas trip shall be provided to the other party with full itinerary and contact details no later than 14 days prior to departure date of the proposed trip. During the overseas trip, the party with the child shall facilitate reasonable video/phone access for the other party to the child._

> _iv_.     _The Defendant shall retain the child’s passport but shall provide copies of the passport to the Plaintiff. Upon receipt of notice of any impending overseas trip, the Defendant shall provide the child’s passport to the Plaintiff at least 3 clear days prior to the date of departure and the Plaintiff shall return the child’s passport to the Defendant with the return of the child to the Defendant._

> _Division of Matrimonial Property_

> _v_.     _In full and final settlement of the division of matrimonial property, the Plaintiff shall pay to the Defendant a sum of $250,000 (less the amount xx that is owed by the Defendant to the Plaintiff) within 3 months from the date of Final Judgement. Thereafter the Plaintiff shall remove the Defendant’s name as occupier of the matrimonial property._

> _vi_.     _Other than as stated above, each party shall retain all of their assets in their own name._

> _Maintenance of Wife_

> _vii_.     _There shall be no wife maintenance payable by the Plaintiff to the Defendant._

> _Maintenance for the child_

> _viii_.     _By consent, the Plaintiff shall pay a sum of $1,000 as monthly maintenance for the child B, commencing on the 30 June 2020 and thereafter on the last day of each month. All payments shall be made into the Defendant’s xxx._

> _ivx_.     _Liberty to apply._

4       The Husband has appealed against my orders relating to care and control and access to the child, division of matrimonial property and maintenance of the child. I now set forth the reasons for my decision.

## Care and Control and Access

#### Position of the parties

5       The Husband had initially requested for shared care and control of the child. His position changed during the proceedings and he eventually requested for sole care and control of the child. He claimed to be better qualified to take care of the child and provide the child with better prospects of a good education. He also claimed that the Wife had behaved violently towards the child. The Wife also sought sole care and control of the child. She however contended that the Husband’s access to the child should be supervised and maintained that he had shown himself to be a negative influence to the child.

## The Law

6       Section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act (Cap 122) states as follows:

> **3**.    Where in any proceedings before any court, the custody or upbringing of an infant or administration of any property belonging to or held in trust for an infant or the application of the income thereof is in question, the court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration and save insofar as such welfare otherwise requires, the father of an infant shall not be deemed to have any right superior to that of the mother in respect of such custody, administration or application nor shall the mother be deemed to have any claim superior to that of the father.

## My decision on care and control and access

7       The child was born in October 2014. In the first few years of the child’s life when the marriage was intact, both parties held full time jobs and were supported by a domestic helper. The Wife stopped working briefly in between but ultimately stopped working in August 2017. By early 2017, the marriage had already broken down. It was not disputed that the Wife had travelled to China from September 2017 to December 2017 but what was not clear from the evidence was where the child resided during this time. From January 2018, the Wife went to Australia for her studies and completed her studies sometime in the middle of 2019. It was undisputed that during this time, the child was taken care of by the Wife’s parents. It was also undisputed that the child returned to the matrimonial home in Singapore with the Wife in June 2019. By this time, the Husband was already residing in Dubai having been posted there for work sometime in August 2018.

8       Based on the above account, it would appear that the child spent the first half of his life in the matrimonial home. As both parties worked, they were supported by a domestic helper who would have taken care of the child in the day while both parents were at work. It is likely that each would have played a part in the upbringing of the child and neither would have been considered the main care giver. In the second half of the child’s life i.e. in the last two and a half years, the child has spent the bulk of his time in the care of his maternal grandparents (from January 2018 to May 2019) and with his mother (from June 2019 to the present time). In light of this, it is clear that the Wife has been the child’s main caregiver at least over the past year.

9       I also considered each parent’s care plan. The Wife was working as a nurse and was supported by a domestic helper while she was at work. If care and control of the child were awarded to her, these current arrangements would likely continue. In contrast, I found the Father’s parental plan to be puzzling. At the time of the hearing, the Husband was still working and residing in Dubai, returning to Singapore for visits every few months. Each time he returned to Singapore, he resided in the matrimonial home and enjoyed free access to this child. This was undisputed. With this current state of affairs and bearing in mind the fact that he was currently not physically based out of Singapore, it was unclear to me how the Husband intended to take care of the child if care and control were granted to him. In this regard, at the hearing, in response to the Court’s queries on this issue, the Husband’s counsel informed the court that his client plans to return to Singapore shortly and until then, the court could grant care and control to the Wife. I was concerned with this proposition for various reasons. Firstly, it was unclear to the court when exactly the Husband would be returning to Singapore to reside permanently. Secondly, while the Husband maintained that he should be granted care and control of the child as the Wife had behaved violently towards the child, he appears to have no issue with leaving the child in the Wife’s care in the interim.

10     Taking into account all of the facts before me and also bearing in mind the principle that the welfare of the child is paramount, I granted sole care and control of the child to the Wife.

11     I now turn to the issue of access. The Husband requested for weekly unsupervised access to the child once on a weekday and once on a weekend if care and control were not granted to him. In addition, he wanted to be able to see the child on alternate public holiday access and also to take the child overseas for a holiday once a year. The Wife claimed that he had behaved inappropriately in the presence of the child during an overseas trip and as a result she had lost all trust in him. For this reason, she was asking that all access granted by the Husband be supervised. It was not disputed that whilst based in Dubai, the Husband has had free access to the child each time he returns to Singapore. I did not see any reason why access should be supervised especially bearing in mind the fact that the Wife was willing to allow the Husband free access to the child during his recent visits to Singapore. I also considered that it would be in the child’s best interests to be afforded the opportunity to develop a bond with his father and accordingly I granted to the Husband the access that he requested for and also made various consequential orders relating to the handover of the child’s passport.

## Division of Matrimonial Property

#### Identification of Matrimonial pool

12     In _BUX v BUY_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHCF 4</span>, the High Court observed that as a general position, all matrimonial assets and liabilities should be identified at the time of the Interim Judgement (IJ) and valued at the time of the ancillary matters hearing. For bank and CPF accounts, their values are to be taken at the time of the IJ, as the matrimonial assets are the moneys and not the bank and CPF accounts themselves. Thus, in general, available values as close to the Ancillary Matters hearing should be used.

13     The parties in this case through counsel agreed that the date of the IJ should be considered for the determination of assets that fell within the matrimonial pool. Likewise, for the valuation of the assets, it was not disputed that the values closest to the date of the ancillary matters hearing should be utilised. Applying this, the undisputed matrimonial assets belonging to the Husband comprised of the matrimonial home, CPF monies, investments, monies in various bank accounts and a motor vehicle while the Wife’s undisputed assets comprised of CPF and monies in bank accounts. The values of these assets were also undisputed.

## Disputed Matrimonial Assets

#### Husband’s Assets

14     There were various categories of assets which the parties disputed should be considered as matrimonial assets. This comprised of Singapore shares that the Husband had purchased through his CDP account, part of the monies in his Singapore bank account, his Abu Dhabi bank account and his Canadian Bank Account as well as an investment.

#### Singapore shares of $319,808

15     It was undisputed that the Husband held Singapore shares totalling a sum of $319,808 (“the Shares”). The Husband however asserted that the entire portfolio of the Shares should be excluded from the matrimonial pool as these had been acquired with moneys he and his sons had inherited from his late wife. In this regard, he also clarified that only 50% of the total value of the Shares belonged to him with the other 50% belonging to his 2 sons. To support his contentions, the Husband provided the CDP Account statement dated June 2019[^1], and the Grant of Letters of Administration issued on 13 June 2014[^2] and contended that by virtue of the fact that the Grant of Letters of Administration showed that as at the date of death in December 2012, his late wife’s Singapore assets were valued at $364,355. In light of this, he argued that it was clear that the entire Shares worth $319,808 had been purchased with monies he had inherited from his Wife and hence should be excluded from the matrimonial pool.

16     Upon examination of the evidence, I found that it was unclear as to when the Shares had in fact been acquired and whether they had been acquired using monies he and his sons had inherited from his late wife or using other monies. I also noted that not all of the Shares had been acquired before the marriage. The Wife’s counsel pointed out that among the listed shares in his portfolio, was a savings bond which the Husband had recently acquired in June 2019 and no evidence was provided to show where the monies for the purchase of this came from. I considered the fact that the Husband appeared to be a savvy investor having invested in various financial instruments both in Singapore and overseas. In light of this and bearing in mind he could have obtained earlier CDP account statements or bank account statements which could have thrown some light on the situation, I was not satisfied that the Husband had provided the necessary evidence to support his contentions. Following my conclusion that the Husband had not shown that these shares had been acquired with the monies he and his sons inherited from his late wife, I did not exclude 50% as belonging to his 2 sons and arrived at the conclusion that this entire sum of $319,808 should be considered as a matrimonial asset.

#### A sum of $27,630 belonging to his elder son

17     Of the monies held in his Singapore account, the Husband contended that a sum of $27,630 should be excluded as this was money belonging to his elder son who had received this from his late mother’s CPF account when he turned 18. His son had paid this to him for safekeeping. In this regard, when asked if he had evidence to support is contentions, the Husband through his counsel indicated that he had none[^3] other than an entry in his bank account statement showing that this money had been paid into his bank account[^4]. I also noted that shortly after the receipt of monies into that account, the Husband made a series of transfers out of that same bank account in excess of the $27,630 transferred into the account. No explanation on this was provided and without this, I was not able to reach a conclusion that the monies had been deposited by the Husband’s elder son for safekeeping. Accordingly, I did not accept the Husband’s contention that the sum of $27,630 were moneys transferred into this account by his son for safekeeping.

#### $10,117 held in his Abu Dhabi account

18     The Husband also wanted to exclude from the matrimonial pool, a sum of $10,117 held in his Abu Dhabi account on the basis that these monies were allowances for hardship overseas posting. It was however not disputed by the Husband’s counsel that these monies were in fact part of his salary and were acquired during the course of the marriage. Given that this sum was received as part of his salary during the course of the marriage, I included the sum of $10,117 into the matrimonial pool.

#### $11,220 in the Husband’s HSBC Investment Funds Account in Canada

19     Finally, the Husband wanted a sum of S$11,220 (C$11,000) to be excluded from the matrimonial pool. He contended that this came from an insurance payout in relation to his late wife’s death and was accordingly sum inherited from the Wife. Other than a bare assertion that all monies he had received from Canada came from the insurance payout to his late wife[^5], I noted that the Husband provided no evidence to show that this amount of $11,220 was in fact part of the monies that had been received as part of the insurance payout. In light of this, I was unable to accept the Husband’s contentions and included this sum as part of the matrimonial pool.

## Adverse Inference and Assets to be added into the pool

20     Each of the parties asked the court to draw an adverse inference against the other. The Wife wanted the court to include into the pool the value of the a US land investment that the Husband had made, while the Husband wanted the court to add to matrimonial pool the value of the China property which the Wife had disposed of shortly after the granting of the interim judgement.

#### The Law on Adverse Inference

21     The High Court in _TIT v TIU_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHCF 8</span> noted as follows:

> “\[31\] As noted by the Court of Appeal in _BG v BF_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 3 SLR(R) 233</span> (“_BG v BF_”), at \[52\], the general duty owed by parties to the court to “make full and frank disclosure of all relevant information within his or her knowledge \[,\] is particularly relevant in the context of the division of matrimonial assets.” The absence of full and frank disclosure would entitle the court to draw a suitable adverse inference.”

22     In **_Chan Tin Sun v Fong Quay Sim_** **<span class="citation">\[2015\] 2 SLR 195</span>**, the Court of Appeal at \[62\] referred to the decision of _Koh Bee Choo v Choo Chai Huah_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] SGCA 21</span> on drawing of adverse inferences:

> “In order for the court to draw an adverse inference, there must be:

> (a)    a substratum of evidence that establishes a prima facie case against the person against whom the inference is to be drawn; and

> (b)    that person must have had some particular access to the information he is said to be hiding.”

The Court of Appeal set forth 2 alternative approaches in giving effect to the adverse inference:

> “\[64\] There are at least two alternative approaches to give effect to the adverse inference drawn against a spouse, both of which have been endorsed by this court: see _NK v NL_ at \[61\] – \[62\]. The first approach is for the court to make a finding of the value of the undisclosed assets on the available evidence and for the party dissatisfied with the value attributed to show that it is unreasonable; if the dissatisfied party is unable to do so, the value is then included in the matrimonial pool for division (see, for example, the Singapore High Court decision of _Tay Sin Tor v Tay Chay Eng_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 2 SLR(R) 385</span> at \[18\]). Although it endorsed this approach, the court in _NK v NL_ also cautioned against “unnecessary speculation with respect to the specific values of undeclared assets” and instead held (at \[62\]) that in the circumstances of the case, “it might be more just and equitable (not to mention, practical) to order a higher proportion of the known assets to be given to the wife.”

#### The Husband’s investment in US land

23     The Wife referred to an investment in US land which the Husband had made with xxx International Group (S) Pte Ltd (“xxx”). She first learned about this when she found a copy of the official receipt dated 25 February 2013 showing that a sum of $49,908 had been paid to xxx. While the Husband did not deny[^6] that such an investment had been made, he claimed that he had attempted to contact the agent with “no favourable response as to the existence of the investment” and accordingly had “considered the investment as a total loss. The Wife provided evidence to show that the relevant company was still a live company and looking at the evidence before me, it was clear that the Husband could easily have produced evidence to show his attempts to contact the agent to no avail but he did not. This coupled with copies of excerpts of his diary as exhibited by the Wife in her 2nd affidavit (page 62) which showed “US Land: US$50K” led me to conclude that the Husband had in fact failed to make the necessary full and frank disclosure in relation to this investment. In light of this, I arrived at the conclusion that the Wife had proven the necessary substratum of evidence that established a prima facie case against the Husband. Accordingly, I added an amount of $49,908 into the matrimonial pool as part of the Husband’s Assets.

#### Value of Wife’s China property

24     The Husband requested that the court add to the Wife’s undisputed assets, a sum of S$166,647 (RMB 850,000). This was the sale price for the Wife’s China property (“the China Property”) which had been sold in February 2019. While the Wife contended that she had sold this property for RMB 850,000 (SGD 166,647), she produced a transfer document showing a sale price of RMB 350,000. She claimed that she had received the total amount of RMB 850,000 in cash from the buyer. She then paid RMB 500,000 to her parents in repayment of monies she had borrowed from them and used the balance amount of RMB 350,000 to fund her studies in Australia. The Wife produced no evidence of any loan taken from her parents or any payment made to them. I also noted that while the Wife asserts to have used the balance RMB 350,000 to pay for her studies in Australia, the dates on the receipts and invoices she produced showed that her study expenses had been incurred prior to the sale of her China property and the receipt of the monies[^7]. Accordingly, I found it difficult to accept her explanation. I also noted that the China Property was sold after the writ of divorce was filed. Taking into consideration all of the above, I agreed with the Husband that the entire amount of $166,648 should be added back into the pool.

## Value of the total Matrimonial Pool

25     Given my findings above and taking into consideration all of the undisputed assets as well as the disputed assets, I determined that the Husband’s assets totalled a sum if $1,471,286 in contrast to the Wife’s assets of $210,632. As such the pool of matrimonial assets totalled a sum of $1,672,918.

## Position of the parties

26     The Husband wanted an end result where each party retained their own assets while the Wife was requesting for 40% of the total pool of assets.

## The legal principles relating to the division of matrimonial property

27     Section 112(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353) (“WC”) empowers the Court to make a division of matrimonial assets in such proportion as the courts deems to be “just and equitable”. In deciding on the question of division, a court must “have regard to all the circumstances of the case” including the extent of contributions made by each party towards acquiring, improving or maintaining the matrimonial assets; any debt owing or obligation incurred or undertaken by either party towards acquiring, improving or maintaining the matrimonial assets; the needs of the children(if any) of the marriage; the extent of the contributions made by each party to the welfare of the family, including looking after the home or caring for the family and the giving of assistance or support by one party to the other, including the giving of assistance or support which aids the other party in the carrying on of his or her occupation or business.

28     In the recent case of _USB v USA_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 57</span>, the Court of appeal summed up the structured approach to division.

29     “\[36\]… Briefly stated, the structured approach prescribes the following steps: (a) first, ascribe a ratio that represents each party’s direct contributions relative to those of the other party, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party has made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets; (b) second, ascribe a second ratio to represent each party’s indirect contribution to the well-being of the family relative to that of the other throughout the marriage; and (c) third, using each party’s respective direct and indirect percentage contributions, derive each party’s average percentage contribution to the family that would form the basis to divide the matrimonial assets (_ANJ v ANK_ at \[22\]; see also _BPC v BPB_ at \[70\]). …

30     The Court of Appeal also confirmed (at \[37\]) that the structured approach should continue to apply in short marriages.

## Direct Contributions

31     As there were no jointly held assets in the matrimonial pool, the direct contributions of each party to the matrimonial pool comprised of the assets that were held in their own names. This translated to the Husband’s direct contribution of 88% as contrasted with the Wife’s direct contribution of 12%.

## Indirect Contributions

32     This was a marriage of 5 years 7 months, a relatively short marriage. At the start of the marriage, both parties worked and were supported by a domestic helper. Each had children from earlier marriages and it appears that contributions were made by both in terms of indirect financial and indirect non-financial contributions.

33     After September 2017, cracks in the marriage appeared and the Wife left the matrimonial home spending the last quarter of 2017 in China. The Husband contends that she left the child behind in Singapore and he took care of the child while the Wife contends that the child was with her in China over that period. Whatever the case, it was undisputed that from January 2018, the child was taken to stay with the maternal grandparents while the Wife went to Australia to further her studies and only returned to Singapore with his mother in June 2019.

34     I would note the observations of the Court of Appeal in the recent case of _USB v USA_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 57</span> at \[43\]:

35     “In our judgment, the broad-brush approach should be applied with particular vigour in assessing the parties’ _indirect_ contributions. This would serve the purpose of discouraging needless acrimony during the ancillary proceedings. Practically, this means that, in ascertaining the ratio of indirect contributions, the court should not focus unduly on the minutiae of family life. Instead, the court should direct its attention to broad factual indicators when determining the ratio of parties’ indirect contributions. These would include factors such as the length of the marriage, the number of children, and which party was the children’s primary caregiver.”

36     Taking into consideration the fact that this was a very short marriage where both played their part and were heavily supported by domestic helpers as well as other third parties like the Wife’s parents, and adopting a broad brush approach, I determined that the applicable ratio for indirect contributions should be 50:50.

## Adjustment of the ratio between direct and indirect contributions

37     The next question to be considered was whether in light of the fact that this was a short marriage, there should be an adjustment of the weightage to be given to each of the direct and indirect contributions. It has been accepted generally that indirect contributions are less significant in short marriages (_USB v USA_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 57</span>). In the case of _ATE v ATD_ and another appeal <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGCA 2</span>, the direct contributions of the parties were assigned a higher weightage in a marriage lasting about five years, In that case, the Court of Appeal observed at \[21\]:

> “Given that the marriage was a short one, that both Husband and Wife were working, the manner in which both Husband and Wife conducted their lives during the marriage itself, and that there was a not inconsiderable amount of assistance on the domestic scene, the appropriate ratio between direct and indirect contributions ought to be 75% and 25% respectively.”

The current case is not dissimilar to the facts in _ATE v ATD_ where the parties had a considerable amount of assistance on the domestic scene and accordingly I am adjusting the weightage between direct and indirect contributions, attributing 75% to direct and 25% to indirect contributions.

## Just and equitable division

38     Applying the adjusted weightages between direct and indirect contributions, I arrived at a division ratio of 78.5% to the Husband and 21.5% to the Wife.

## Adjustments and Adverse Inference

39     I had earlier in these grounds set out the requirements that must be fulfilled before the court can draw an adverse inference and had also outlined the 2 alternative approaches in giving effect to the adverse inference (See paragraph 22 above). In addition to her request to include the value of the investment of the US land as part of the Husband’s assets, which I had already done, the Wife was requesting that the court draws an adverse inference against the Husband for his failure to make full and frank disclose in relation to the following:

> a.      _ICBC bank account in China_

> The Wife contended that the Husband had not been forthcoming about his bank accounts in China, namely his ICBC bank account. Despite his negative responses to interrogatories asking if he had any additional bank accounts, the Wife obtained copies of his ICBC bank account in China showing that the account existed at least until 25 February 2015[^8]. Notwithstanding, the Husband failed to provide any documentary evidence to show the status of this bank account instead simply stating that there is no money left in this ICBC account and it could have been dormant since 2015[^9]. I did not find that this was a satisfactory explanation and arrived at the conclusion that the Husband had not made the requisite full and frank disclosure required.

> b.      _OCBC Bank Account xxx-001_

> The Wife produced a copy of an Insurance payment Slip dated 2 March 2014 from OCBC bank showing that the Husband had made payment of some insurance premiums in a sum of $30,000[^10]. The Husband claimed that this sum had been deposited by the parties and withdrawn by the Wife to finance her China property[^11]. I did not find that this was a satisfactory explanation especially in light of the fact that the documentary evidence pointed to the fact that the relevant sum had been used for the payment of insurance premiums and had been endorsed by only the Husband.

> c.      _Documents relating to insurance policies_

> The Wife contended that the Husband had failed to produce relevant statements or documents for 3 of his insurance policies. While the Husband claims that these policies have lapsed and no longer exist, he has not produced any documents to support this. Given that it is entirely within the Husband’s power to obtain relevant statements or other documentation to show the current status of the various policies, I accept that the Wife has established the requisite prima facie case against the Husband.

40     In light of all of the above, I proceeded to draw an adverse inference against the Husband, adjusting the Wife’s share of the matrimonial pool. After taking into consideration the adjustment to be made in respect of the adverse inference to be drawn and also taking into consideration the needs of the child, my final decision was that the matrimonial pool should be divided in the ratio of 73:27.

41     Upon factoring the value of the Wife’s own assets, I ordered that the Husband pay to the Wife a sum of $250,000. As it was undisputed that the Wife had borrowed money from the Husband to purchase the China Property and part of the loan remained outstanding, I ordered that in full and final settlement of all issues relating to the division of property, the Husband shall pay to the Wife a sum of $250,000 less any amount which the Wife owed to the Husband in respect of moneys she had previously borrowed from him.

## Child Maintenance

42     Parties agreed through counsel during the hearing that the child’s expenses total a sum of $1,393. The parties also agreed that regardless of the outcome of care and control, the Husband would bear $1,000 of the child’s expenses and the Wife, $393 of the child’s expenses. Given that I have granted that the care and control of the child has been granted to the Wife, I ordered that the Husband pay to the Wife monthly maintenance of $1,000 per month for the child of the marriage.

## Conclusion

43     In conclusion, I have carefully considered all the evidence and submissions of the parties and arrived at what I considered to be the just and equitable orders in relation to the division of assets. My orders relating to the care and control and access to the child considered the best interests of the child in the circumstances and my orders on child maintenance reflected the agreement between the parties.
