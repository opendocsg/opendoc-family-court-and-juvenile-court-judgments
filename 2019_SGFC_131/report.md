### District Judge Sheik Mustafa:

## Introduction

1       The parties were divorced by virtue of an interim judgment on 17 December 2018. They could not come to an agreement on ancillary matters. After hearing the arguments on these ancillary issues, I ordered the following –

> a.     Both parties are to have joint custody of their 2 children;

> b.     The Wife is to have care and control of the children;

> c.     The Husband is to have reasonable access to the children;

> d.     The Husband is to pay $500 a month each for the maintenance of the two children;

> e.     The Husband is not liable to pay maintenance to the Wife;

> f.     The parties’ matrimonial home is to be sold in the open market within 6 months of the date of the Final Judgment herein. The proceeds of sale shall be used to settle the outstanding mortgage with interest, and then to refund to the CPF account, with interest, the CPF contribution of the Wife’s mother. The balance thereafter shall be divided 59% to the Wife and 41% to the Husband. From their respective shares of the balance, each party shall refund to their own CPF accounts the amounts withdrawn for the matrimonial home, with accrued interest. The expenses of the sale, including that of a housing agent, shall be borne 59% by the Wife and 41% by the Husband;

> g.     The Wife shall transfer all her shares in a business (D Pte Ltd[^1]) to the Husband absolutely without consideration, within 6 months of the date of the Final Judgment to be issued herein. The Husband shall bear any expenses related to the transfer;

> h.     The Wife shall transfer the ownership of a car to the Husband upon the Husband’s full settlement of the outstanding loan, with interest if any, and paying for any fees and expenses for the transfer. This transfer shall be completed within 1 month from the date of the Final Judgment to be issued herein;

> i.     Each party is entitled to retain all other assets that are in their own respective names and which are not mentioned specifically above;

> j.     The registrar or deputy registrar of the Family Justice Courts under section 31(1) of the Family Justice Act is empowered to execute sign or indorse all necessary documents relating to matters contained in this order on behalf of either party should either party fail to do so within 7 days of written request being made to the party.

2       The Husband appeals against all the orders except for the order of the transfer of the car to himself and the order that parties keep all other assets that are in their own names. Regarding the children, the Husband appeals against the order granting care and control of one child to the Wife, as well as the corresponding order that he contribute to that child’s maintenance.

3       I now provide the grounds for my decision.

## Background facts

4       At the time of the interim judgment, the parties had been married for more than 27 years. The Wife is 50 years old, and she is a freelance trainer. The Husband is 53 years old and is a project director.

5       The marriage had been dissolved based on both parties’ statements of claim that the other had behaved unreasonably. It is also not disputed by both parties that the Husband had left the matrimonial home in September 2017, and that the parties have been living separate and apart since then.

6       They have 3 children, an eldest daughter who is almost 22 years old, another daughter who is 20 years old and a son who is 16 years old. Both parties ask for care and control of the children, as well as maintenance for them.

7       There is a matrimonial home, which is an HDB maisonette, jointly owned by the parties and the Wife’s mother. There is a company, a car, bank accounts, shares and CPF savings which form part of the assets to be divided between them.

8       The Wife also asks for maintenance for herself.

## Custody Care and Control of the Children

9       As above stated, there are minor 2 children in issue, aged 20 and 16 years old. There is also an eldest daughter, who is above 21 years old and is not an issue before this Court. After the Husband moved out, all 3 children continued to reside in the matrimonial home with the Wife.

10     Both parties agree to have joint custody of the children. However, they both pray for sole care and control of the children.

11     The Wife submits that the children both have a close relationship to their eldest sister. Her counsel submits that all three children have expressed their wishes to stay with their mother.

12     In his submissions, the Husband’s only argument on this is to rely on the only paragraph regarding this issue in his affidavit stating –

> “The reason why I am respectfully asking the honourable Court to grant me care and control over the children is because the \[Wife\] was often engaged in her own activities instead of focusing on the children, for example, our youngest child has told me that he was left at home to take care of himself with the fast processing \[sic.\] meals laid out for him to microwave and that the \[Wife\] was not in. this fits in with my experience living with the \[Wife\]. That is, the \[Wife\] did not like staying at home and would often be out and did the minimum possible amount of household chores, in particular, she would do the minimum laundry and meal preparation, possible \[sic\]. For example, the \[Wife\] would put the clothes into the washing machine but leave it to her mother to hang them up to dry and meal preparation was often in the form of buying microwaveable meals and/or Maggi Mee.”.

## Applicable principles

13     The law to apply on this issue flows from section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, which states as follows:

> “Where in any proceedings before any Court the custody or upbringing of an infant or the administration of any property belonging to or held in trust for an infant or the application of the income thereof is in question, the Court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration and save in so far as such welfare otherwise requires the father of an infant shall not be deemed to have any right superior to that of the mother in respect of such custody, administration or application nor shall the mother be deemed to have any claim superior than that of the father.”

## Conclusion on custody care and control of the child

14     Regarding the Wife’s counsel’s submission that the children both have a close relationship to their eldest sister, who is residing with them, I place no weight to this particular submission as it is not supported by any specific evidence of such in the affidavits.

15     Nevertheless, the remaining evidence adduced by the Wife does lead me to conclude on a balance of probabilities, that she had been and she still is, the children’s primary caregiver. The evidence shows that she was the one who was directly supporting them, in that she has been paying for their hand phone bills, their childcare and kindergarten fees, school fees, swimming, phonics, piano and tuition fees. EZ-Link costs, insurance premiums, medical and dental expenses, providing pocket money, and paying for books, uniforms and stationery. All these lead to the conclusion that the Wife is and is intimately and intricately aware of the children’s needs, and is addressing them.

16     This is in contrast to the Husband’s evidence pointing out what appears to be a generalisation of the Wife’s unsuitability based on trivial and irrelevant incidents. In any event, the Husband has not shown why it would be in the son’s best interest to entrust his care and control to the Husband instead. I note that the Husband had moved out of the matrimonial home. He has not described any fact that inspires confidence in me that he is in a better position to care and control the boy than the Wife is.

17     Taking into account all the facts of the case, the conclusion drawn on a balance of probabilities is that it is in the best interest of the two children that they should remain the joint custody of both parents, and with care and control to be with the Wife.

18     The Husband appeals against only the order that the Wife is to have care and control of the son, and he is not appealing against the order regarding the daughter. In this regard, the Court’s conclusion remains as stated above.

19     On the matter of access, I took into account –

> a.     That the children are not little (they are 16 and 20 years old) and presumably able to transport themselves to and from the Husband as and when they wish,

> b.     That neither party requested for anything other than reasonable access for the other, and

> c.     That there is no indication, nor evidence, that either party has been refusing or obstructing access of the children.

20     Therefore, I found that an order of reasonable access would be in the children’s best interests in the circumstances.

## Maintenance for the children

21     The Husband appeals against my order of him to pay $500 a month for the maintenance of each of the two children.

22     The Wife submitted details of the children’s expenses in her affidavit of assets and means. According to her, each month she spends $2,055 on the daughter and $1,490 on the son. She alleges that she is the sole provider of maintenance of the children without contribution from the Husband. In her affidavit of assets and means, she prays for the Husband to pay $500 a month for each child[^2]. However, at the hearing, her counsel argued that the Husband should pay her a lump sum for the maintenance of the 2 children instead, in the amounts of $24,000 ($1,000 a month × 24 months) for the daughter, and $48,000 ($800 a month × 60 months) for the son.

23     The Husband, who had argued for care and control of all the children to be granted to him, asked for the Wife to contribute $500 a month for each child. In his affidavit of assets and means, he stated that the expenses on the children to be “N.A.”[^3].

## Applicable principles

24     Section 69(2) of the Women’s Charter provides that this Court may, on due proof that a parent has neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for his child who is unable to maintain himself, order that parent to pay a monthly allowance or a lump sum for the maintenance of that child.

25     In section 69(4), the Charter provides that this Court, when ordering maintenance for a child under this section, shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the following matters:

> a.     the financial needs of the child;

> b.     the income, earning capacity (if any), property and other financial resources of the child;

> c.     any physical or mental disability of the child;

> d.     the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage;

> e.     the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family;

> f.     the standard of living enjoyed by the child before a parent neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the child;

> g.     in the case of a child, the manner in which he was being, and in which the parties to the marriage expected him to be, educated or trained;

> h.     the conduct of each of the parties to the marriage, if the conduct is such that it would in the opinion of the Court be inequitable to disregard it.

26     In _TIT v TIU_[^4] the High Court stated that the case of _ANJ v ANK_ accepted the principle that maintenance of children should be apportioned in accordance with, inter alia, the financial capabilities of the parents.

## Conclusion on maintenance of the children

27     I noted that the Wife claimed to have an income of $1,500 - $1,700 a month. She did not declare that she owed any creditors other than for the mortgage and for telephone bills. She did not account how she was able to singlehandedly meet the children’s expenses of $2,055 on the daughter and $1,490 on the son. Therefore, on a balance of probabilities, I find that the children’s expenses listed by the Wife is higher than in reality.

28     On the other hand, I find that the children’s total expenses cannot be less than the Wife’s declared income of $1,500 either. It is more probable that the Wife did not declare the full extent of her income and means. As the Husband did not provide any evidence of how much he contributed to the children’s expenses himself, the Court did not have the benefit of his evidence to counter the Wife’s version of her means as well as of the children’s expenses.

29     I find that the Wife’s income is, on average, $1,600 a month. I find the Husband’s income is, on average, $1,900 a month. Their total average income would be $3,500 a month. Their relative incomes are therefore 46:54.

30     I find that what is a reasonable picture of the monthly expenses of the son is $900 a month.

31     Applying the principle in _TIT v TIU_, I find that the Husband ought to bear 54% of these expenses, which is $500 a month ($486 rounded up). This is in line with the Wife’s first request in her affidavit of assets and means, which, in my view, is more realistic and probable. I also find that the sum is reasonably within the Husband’s means. I also note that this was the amount that the Husband prayed for the Wife to contribute to each child’s maintenance, which evidences what he himself assesses to be a reasonable sum of maintenance.

## The Matrimonial Assets

32     The Husband appeals against two of my orders in this regard as follows–

> “The matrimonial home is to be sold in the open market within 6 months of the date of the Final Judgment herein. The proceeds of sale shall be used to settle the outstanding mortgage with interest, and then to refund to the CPF account, with interest, the CPF contribution of the Wife’s mother. The balance thereafter shall be divided 59% to the Wife and 41% to the Husband. From their respective shares of the balance, each party shall refund to their own CPF accounts the amounts withdrawn for the matrimonial home, with accrued interest. The expenses of the sale, including that of a housing agent, shall be borne 59% by the Wife and 41% by the Husband.”

> and

> “The Wife shall transfer all her shares in a business (D Pte Ltd[^5]) to the Husband absolutely without consideration, within 6 months of the date of the Final Judgment to be issued herein. The Husband shall bear any expenses related to the transfer.”

33     The matrimonial asset pool is made up of the following –

> a.     The matrimonial home,

> b.     The CPF balances of the Wife,

> c.     The CPF balances of the Husband,

> d.     Shares in D Pte Ltd in the name of the Wife,

> e.     Money in a bank account of the Wife,

> f.     Money in a bank account of the Husband,

> g.     A car registered in the name of the Wife,

> h.     Shares in listed companies owned by the Wife.

##### The matrimonial home.

34     The matrimonial home is an HDB maisonette. There was no agreement on its value. The Wife submitted the value to be $750,000 based on a result of a search showing the sale of a 5-room flat in the same vicinity, from 6 months before the date of hearing. The Husband submitted the value of the matrimonial home to be $990,000, based on the result of a search showing the sale of 2 maisonettes in the vicinity at $990,000 in December 2018 for a larger unit and $830,000 in October 2018 for a unit of similar size to the matrimonial home. Both units were located 1 kilometre away from the matrimonial home. Both of these figures were also more than 6 months old by the time of hearing.

35     An updated search on the HDB resale transactions website showed a result for a more recent sale, taking place in the same month as the hearing. The sale shown was of a maisonette more similar to the floor size of the matrimonial flat than the others were. It revealed a sale price of $905,000. I find this to be the closest indication of the value of the matrimonial home, and I adopt it as its value for the purposes of computation[^6].

36     The Husband, the Wife and the Wife’s mother, jointly own the flat. The Wife’s mother had contributed $16,581 (inclusive of accrued interest) to the flat from her CPF. She deposed an affidavit stating that she confirmed the flat to be the matrimonial property of the Wife and the Husband, that she merely wanted a refund of her CPF contribution, and undertook to respect and enforce any order that is made regarding the interest in the matrimonial flat. At the outset of the hearing, the counsel for both the Husband and the Wife accepted this. In the circumstances, there was no need for a determination of the third party interest that the Wife’s mother has in the matrimonial flat[^7]. After refunding the Wife’s mother’s CPF with interest, and the outstanding loan to be paid upon its sale[^8], the value of the flat is $779,159.00.

##### Assets other than the home

37     Other than the matrimonial home, the couple has other assets. There are funds in the CPF accounts of the Wife that amount to $109,928.99[^9], and funds in the CPF accounts of the Husband that amount to $116,850.45[^10].

38     There are shares in D Pte Ltd[^11] in the name of the Wife. There was no valuation of its value, but both parties treated the value to be that of the initial capital of $30,000.00. The Husband asked for these shares to be transferred to him. The Wife proposed to transfer them to him for $30,000.00.

39     There are funds in a bank account of the Wife of $532.00, and in the bank account of the Husband of $104.00.

40     There is a car registered in the name of the Wife, although used and paid for by the Husband. There is a financing on it. The details are not in the affidavits filed in the case, but counsel assisted the Court by pointing out that the car’s COE is valid until 16 September 2020, which is 1 year away. The Husband’s counsel relayed his client’s instructions that the car has a zero net value. There Wife’s lawyer said that the car has a scrap value of $10,000.00 from 3 months before, but there is no other evidence on this. Ultimately, I found that the car was of no significant value, but almost exclusively used by the Husband although registered to the Wife.

41     There are shares in listed companies owned by the Wife valued at $3,073.00.

42     The combined value of the matrimonial asset pool is therefore $1,039,648.00.

43     The Wife prayed for the matrimonial flat to be sold in the open market, and the proceeds of the sale, after refund of CPF and mortgage, to be divided 68.88% to her, and 31.12% to the Husband.

44     The Husband asked for an order that the matrimonial flat be sold in the open market, and the proceeds of the sale, after refund of CPF and mortgage, and $607,830.54 to be given to him[^12].

## Applicable law on division of matrimonial assets

45     As a start to my inquiry into dealing with the assets, I refer to section 112 of the Women’s Charter –

> 112.— (1)    The Court shall have power, when granting or subsequent to the grant of a judgment of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage, to order the division between the parties of any matrimonial asset or the sale of any such asset and the division between the parties of the proceeds of the sale of any such asset in such proportions as the Court thinks just and equitable.

> (2)    It shall be the duty of the Court in deciding whether to exercise its powers under subsection (1) and, if so, in what manner, to have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the following matters:

>> (a)    the extent of the contributions made by each party in money, property or work towards acquiring, improving or maintaining the matrimonial assets;

>> (b)    any debt owing or obligation incurred or undertaken by either party for their joint benefit or for the benefit of any child of the marriage;

>> (c)    the needs of the children (if any) of the marriage;

>> (d)    the extent of the contributions made by each party to the welfare of the family, including looking after the home or caring for the family or any aged or infirm relative or dependant of either party;

>> (e)    any agreement between the parties with respect to the ownership and division of the matrimonial assets made in contemplation of divorce;

>> (f)    any period of rent-free occupation or other benefit enjoyed by one party in the matrimonial home to the exclusion of the other party;

>> (g)    the giving of assistance or support by one party to the other party (whether or not of a material kind), including the giving of assistance or support which aids the other party in the carrying on of his or her occupation or business; and

>> (h)    the matters referred to in section 114(1) so far as they are relevant. These are –

>>> (a)    the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;

>>> (b)    the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;

>>> (c)    the standard of living enjoyed by the family before the breakdown of the marriage;

>>> (d)    the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage;

>>> (e)    any physical or mental disability of either of the parties to the marriage;

>>> (f)    the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family; and

>>> (g)    in the case of proceedings for divorce or nullity of marriage, the value to either of the parties to the marriage of any benefit (for example, a pension) which, by reason of the dissolution or annulment of the marriage that party will lose the chance of acquiring.

46     The Court of Appeal decision in the case of _ANJ V ANK_[^13] outlined the approach in division of matrimonial assets. Accordingly, the task at hand for me was to derive a ratio which represents the parties’ respective direct contributions towards the acquisition or improvement of matrimonial assets. Next, I was to derive a second ratio, which represents the parties’ indirect financial and non-financial contributions towards the welfare of the family. I should then average the two ratios to derive each party’s overall contribution to the family. The “average percentage contribution” or “average ratio” are non-binding figures, and I would have to make adjustments as and when necessary. I bore these in mind, as well as that adjustments might also be necessary whenever the parties’ collective direct contribution do not carry the same weight as that of the parties’ collective indirect contribution.

47     I was aware that the division of matrimonial assets was not an exact science, but neither was it an indefinable art. I noted that it was not mandatory for the Court to exercise its power of division in every single asset of the parties before it as long as it did not detract for the Court’s overall mandate to achieve a just and equitable division in the light of all of the circumstances of the case[^14].

## Application of the law to the facts

48     There are numerous points of factual dispute on the direct contributions of each party, and this is to be expected in a marriage as long as the present one, of 27 ½ years.

49     In contention is the issue of cash payments towards the acquisition of the matrimonial home. Payments towards the acquisition of the home came from D Pte Ltd. The sole director and shareholder of this company was the Husband. However, when the Husband became bankrupt and lost eligibility to remain so, the Wife took over the roles from him. The Husband continued to manage the company, but as the sole shareholder and director, the Wife became liable and responsible for it. The Husband alleges that the Wife wrongfully withdrew funds from the company for her own benefit. The Wife denies that and counters that she had to inject funds into the company from her own savings.

50     The Husband claims that a total of $35,639.38 was drawn from the company to pay for the matrimonial home. He submits that this ought to be wholly treated as his contribution to the acquisition of the matrimonial home. Countering this, the Wife argues that it ought to be regarded as her contribution since she was the sole shareholder and director of the company at the material time.

51     The issue is how to allocate the $35,639.38 between the parties when the facts are cloudy. I adopted the approach described by the High Court in _TXW v TXX_ :

> “Section 112 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“WC”) confers upon the Court the power to order the division of the parties’ matrimonial assets. The power to divide matrimonial assets is to be exercised in broad strokes, with the Court determining what is just and equitable in the circumstances of each case: _ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span> at \[17\]. The Court of Appeal held in _Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo Nancy_ and another appeal <span class="citation">\[2011\] 2 SLR 1157</span> (“Yeo Chong Lin”) (at \[81\]) that:

>> At the end of the day, we wish to underscore the point that the broad brush approach … is all about feel and the Court’s sense of justice.”[^15]

52     I applied a broad brush approach to this issue. The Husband was clearly the main mover of the company, and the Wife was a secondary player, albeit not a negligible one. Accordingly, I attributed 15% of the $35,639.38 as the Wife’s share, and the balance 85% as the Husband’s.

53     The respective contributions by the parties to the total matrimonial asset pool can now be outlined as follows -

> a.     The Wife’s share of the cash contribution to the acquisition of the matrimonial home is $5,346 (15% of the total), and the Husband’s share is $30,293 (85% of the total).

> b.     The total of the Wife’s direct contribution to the matrimonial asset pool amount to $281,606. This comprises of –

>> i.       CPF payments towards the matrimonial home of $132,725,

>> ii.       15% share of the cash payment to the matrimonial home equivalent to $5,346,

>> iii.       Balances in her CPF account of $109,929,

>> iv.       Money in her bank accounts of $533,

>> v.       Shares in her name valued at $3,073,

>> vi.       Shares in D Pte Ltd worth $30,000,

>> vii.       A car of nominal value.

> c.     The total of the Husband’s direct contribution to the matrimonial asset pool amount to $359,443. This comprises of –

>> i.       CPF payments towards the matrimonial home of $212,195,

>> ii.       85% share of the cash payment to the matrimonial home equivalent to $30,293,

>> iii.       Balances in his CPF account of $116,851,

>> iv.       Money in his bank accounts of $104.

54     The direct contributions made by the parties of $281,606 by the Wife and $359,443 by the Husband correspond to 44% by the Wife and 56% by the Husband or 44:56 in terms of the first ratio prescribed by _ANJ V ANK._

55     The second ratio prescribed by _ANJ V ANK_ is that of the indirect financial and non-financial contributions towards the welfare of the family. The totality of the evidence shows that the Wife was the majority non-financial contributor to the household. I find the ratio to be 67% by the Wife and 33% by the Husband. This is 67:33 in ratio terms.

56     Thirdly, as prescribed by _ANJ v ANK_, I then averaged the two ratios to derive each party’s overall contribution to the family. I find that in the overall circumstances of the case, the direct and indirect contributions have equal weight of 50:50.

57     The above exercise results in allocating to the Wife a 55.5% share of the matrimonial asset pool worth $577,004.64, and to the Husband a 44.5% share worth $462,643.36, out of the total matrimonial asset pool of $1,039,648.00.

## Conclusion on division of assets

58     I proceeded the divide the assets in sole names between the parties first. I decided that since the Husband was the real person behind D Pte Ltd, and that the Wife had no use for it, that it be transferred to the Husband with no consideration.

59     I also decided that although the car is registered in the Wife’s name, since the Husband was the one using it and paying for it, that it ought to be transferred to the Husband without any consideration. As the car was of either nominal or negative value, this does not significantly affect the parties’ respective shares of the matrimonial asset pool.

60     In order to achieve the 55.5% share worth $557,004.64 to the Wife to be realised, I decided that she be given the following –

> a.     Balances in her CPF account of $109,929,

> b.     Money in her bank accounts of $533,

> c.     Shares in her name valued at $3,073,

> d.     $463,469.64 or 59.48% of the net proceeds of sale of the matrimonial home after deducting the Wife’s mother’s CPF contribution with interest. I round down the share to 59%.

61     Conversely, in order to achieve the 44.5% share worth $462,643.36 to the Husband to be realised, I decided that he be given the following –

> a.     Balances in his CPF account of $116,850.45,

> b.     Money in his bank accounts of $104,

> c.     The shares of D Pte Ltd valued at $30,000,

> d.     The car registered in the Wife’s name,

> e.     $315,688.36 or 40.5% of the net proceeds of sale of the matrimonial home after deducting the Wife’s mother’s CPF contribution with interest. I round up the share to 41%.

62     I was satisfied that giving the Wife 55.5% of the matrimonial assets is just and fair, not only for the reasons above, but also taking into account that the children of the marriage will continue to reside with her after the divorce. On the other hand, the Husband will be living by himself. A larger share of the assets granted to the Wife will enable not only her, but the children of the parties as well, to afford accommodation for themselves. This is a relevant consideration under s112(2)(c) of the Women’s Charter –

> 112\. — (2)    It shall be the duty of the Court in deciding whether to exercise its powers under subsection (1) and, if so, in what manner, to have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the following matters: …

>> (c)    the needs of the children (if any) of the marriage.

## Maintenance for the Wife

63     The Husband appeals against my order that he is not liable for maintenance of the Wife. The Wife had prayed for nominal maintenance of $1 for herself.

## Applicable law on the maintenance of a former Wife

64     On the issue of maintenance for a former wife, the Women’s Charter provides –

> 114.— (1)    In determining the amount of any maintenance to be paid by a man to his wife or former wife, or by a woman to her incapacitated husband or incapacitated former husband, the Court shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the following matters:

>> (a)    the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;

>> (b)    the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;

>> (c)    the standard of living enjoyed by the family before the breakdown of the marriage;

>> (d)    the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage;

>> (e)    any physical or mental disability of either of the parties to the marriage;

>> (f)    the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family; and

>> (g)    in the case of proceedings for divorce or nullity of marriage, the value to either of the parties to the marriage of any benefit (for example, a pension) which, by reason of the dissolution or annulment of the marriage that party will lose the chance of acquiring.

65     The Court of Appeal stated in the case of _ATE v ATD_[^16], that this Court

> “cannot – and ought not to – order nominal maintenance automatically or as a matter of course… the Court has to examine closely all the facts and circumstances of the case before deciding whether or not to award nominal maintenance in order to preserve the wife’s right to apply for maintenance in future.”

66     The Court of Appeal added that

> it will not suffice for the wife to argue – without more – that she is entitled to an order if nominal maintenance simply because her situation might change in future. Indeed, it has, in general, never been the duty of the Courts to compensate parties for the vicissitudes of life. It would also result (in substance and effect) in making the husband a general insurer of sorts. This would be wholly contrary to the very purpose of awarding maintenance to a former wife in the first place.

## Conclusion on the maintenance of the Wife

67     On this issue, I take into account the following relevant facts –

> a.     The Wife has been employed for most of the marriage, including the present, and her earning capacity is not substantially less than the Husband’s;

> b.     According to the Wife, the Husband had never maintained her, and that she maintained the children;

> c.     After the sale of the matrimonial home, the Wife will be left with a substantial share of 55.5% of the total matrimonial asset pool.

68     I find that the above will be substantial enough to remove the Wife’s need for maintenance from the Husband.

69     In addition, applying section 114 as well as the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in _ATE v ATD_, I find that the circumstances of the present case are not so exceptional such that nominal maintenance ought to be preserved for the Wife.

70     In view of the above, I ordered that there should be no maintenance payable by the Husband to the Wife.

## Proxy power

71     The Husband also appeals against my order that

> “The registrar or deputy registrar of the Family Justice Courts under section 31(1) of the Family Justice Act is empowered to execute sign or indorse all necessary documents relating to matters contained in this order on behalf of either party should either party fail to do so within 7 days of written request being made to the party.”

72     In written submissions to the Court, both counsel had prayed for such an order that the Court execute documents in the event that either party fails to comply with the orders and defaults to execute documents to effect the order.

73     At the tail end of delivering judgment on ancillary matters, and counsel for the Husband then informed the Court that he wished to confirm his client’s instructions on this aspect.

74     I disagreed with the Husband’s learned counsel and I made the order. In my view, once judgment is passed and orders are issued, parties became aware of their relative positions in the case. It would be unfair to allow either party to change their position on this particular issue, save for very good reasons, which, in my view, did not arise.

75     In any event, even if the Husband’s position had been against the making of such an order before I made it, I would have made the order anyway, as it is just and reasonable in the circumstances of the case in order to give effect to the orders in the judgment.
