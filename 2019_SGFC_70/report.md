Family Law – Child – Access

12 September 2019

### District Judge Wong Keen Onn:

## Introduction

1       This is the Plaintiff (applicant UXV) appeal against the Order of Court dated 19 February 2019 regarding the unsupervised access and overnight access to the child of the marriage (“child”). The Plaintiff was legally aided at the hearing. This matter concerned cross summonses filed to vary the Ancillary Order dated 23 May 2016[^1] regarding custody of and access to the child, now 7 years old.

2       The Plaintiff (“Mother”) had sought to vary the Ancillary Order by filing Summons 673/2017 on 28 February 2017 seeking the following:

> (1)     a change from joint custody (by consent) to one of sole custody of the child (_prayer 1 (a)_)

> (2)     to remove reasonable access and/or unsupervised/overnight access to the child (_prayer 1(b_))

> (3)     to order the Father and child to undergo psychiatric counselling/therapy/evaluation (_prayers 2 and 3_).

The Defendant Father also filed a cross summons to vary the custody care and control and access order in his favour (Summons 727/2017 dated 6 March 2017).

3       On 24 October 2017, the Court heard matters relating only to issues of change of custody, care and control. However, counsel for the Mother applied to withdraw the summons prayers 1(a), 2 and 4 (on custody, care and control and psychiatric counselling). The Court granted her leave to withdraw these prayers. The Court also dismissed the Father’s summons to reverse care and control and adjourned the matters relating to access. On 19 February 2019, the Court heard parties on the issue of access and rejected the Mother’s application on varying access and made orders.

## Background

4       The Plaintiff \[UXV\] (also referred to as the “Mother”), aged 44, and the Defendant \[UXW\] (referred to as “the Father”), aged 46, were married on 14 December 1997. They adopted a child during the said marriage, \[B\][^2], now 7 years old. The parties finalised their divorce on 29 September 2016.[^3]

5       The ancillary matters were heard and completed on 23 May 2016, whereupon the Court had made an Ancillary Order granting, amongst other things, a _consent order_ for joint custody of the child of the marriage to the parties with care and control to the Plaintiff. At this time, the child was around 4 years of age. The Court also ordered reasonable unsupervised access to the Defendant as shown below.

> (1)     dinner access for 2 days a week and

> (2)     from the date of the Order with until 31 May 2016, unsupervised day access on every Saturday with at a public place.

> (3)     With effect from 1 June 2016, the day access would be replaced with overnight access from 3 pm on Saturday to 11 am on Sunday in the presence of one of his female relative[^4]. There would be alternative public date access from 9 am to 6 pm

There was no appeal against the Ancillary Order.

## Developments after the Ancillary Hearing

6       On 28 June 2016, the Plaintiff made a complaint against the Defendant to the Child Protection Services (“CPS”), Ministry of Social and Family Development (“MSF”), for allegations that the Father had touched the child inappropriately on her private parts and had “twisted the child’s arm” on 16 June 2016. MSF filed a police report on behalf of the Mother. All these led to the application of care and protection orders in the Youth Court. On 1 July 2016, the Youth Court ordered the child be placed under the care of the Mother for a period of 2 months and restricting the Father’s access subject to the approval of relevant MSF officer. This was followed by another Statutory Supervision Court order for another 4-month period till January 2017. On 13 January 2017, the Youth Court did granted grant any further extension of the child protection orders as the Court felt there was no longer any significant care and protection concerns for the child. It was not in dispute that notwithstanding the discharge of the care and protection order, the Mother continued to refuse the Defendant Father access to the child as per the Ancillary Order.

7       On 31 January 2017, the Defendant Father sought leave to commence committal proceedings. After obtaining leave, he filed a summons for committal[^5] against the Plaintiff Mother for breaching the access orders. This was subsequently resolved at the hearing on 1 November 2017 in which the parties reached an amicable settlement whereby the summons for committal was withdrawn with a consent order for the Father to have replacement access[^6].

## Variation Applications (Summons 673/2017 and 727/2018)

8       On 28 February 2017, the Plaintiff Mother filed this Summons 673/2017 to vary the access orders (see \[2\] and \[3\] above\]. The Mother also filed application to suspend the provision on access in the Ancillary Order (Summons 617/2017). On 6 March 2017, the Defendant Father filed a cross summons 727/2017 to vary the Ancillary Order by seeking sole custody, reverse care and control and vary the access orders and seek other related orders.

9       Given the various allegations, the Court decide to exercise more caution, gave the benefit of doubt to the applicant pending the assessment and temporarily suspended the access orders in paragraphs 3 b, 4(a) to (g) of the Order of Court dated 23 May 2016 pending the hearing of summons 617/2017, 673/2017 and 727/2017[^7]. The Court ordered that for the interim, the Father was to have Supervised Visitation (“SV”) at the Divorce Support Specialist Agency (“DSSA”). The Court also called for an updated CPS Social Report for the child[^8]. A total of 32 SV sessions were conducted. The Court also asked parties to obtain an update of the status of the ongoing police investigations against the Defendant Father (“police investigations”).

10     After the Social Report was submitted to the Court, I proceeded on 24 October 2017 to hear the matter in the Cross-Summonses 673/2017 and 727/2017 regarding the change of custody, care and control. At the hearing, counsel for the Mother applied to withdraw the summons prayers 1(a), 2 and 4 (on custody, care and control and psychiatric counselling). The Court granted her leave to withdraw these prayers. The Court also dismissed the Father’s summons to reverse care and control (see \[3\] above). As for access, the Court ordered further SV sessions and adjourned the matter relating to access. There was no appeal against these orders.

11     On completion of the DSSA report and after counsel had obtained an update of the outcome of the outstanding police investigations (on the “alleged sexual abuse”), I heard the parties on 19 February 2019 regarding on the outstanding issue of access. I then made the following orders:

> “Paragraph 3 b (4) of Order of Court ORC 4668/2016 dated 23 May 2016 is deleted and replaced with the following access order:

>> “3 b (4)    The Defendant husband shall have reasonable unsupervised access to the said child of the marriage, namely, \[B\] (also referred to as “the child”) as follows: -

The party holding the passport(s) is to deliver the child’s passport(s) to the travelling party in good time to enable the purchasing of the tickets and visa requirements if necessary. The travelling party is to return the passport to the party who is entitled to hold the passport within 1 day of the child’s return to Singapore.

>>> (m)    For the avoidance of doubt, this Order shall supersede paragraph 2 of Order of Court ORC 1731/2017 dated 29 March 2017 and paragraph (e) of Order of Court ORC 5361/2018 dated 24 October 2017

>>> (n)    "If you, the within-named \[UXW\] and/or \[UXV\] disobey this order, you will be liable to process of execution for the purpose of compelling you to obey the same"

12     The Plaintiff Mother has appealed against this Order and I now give the reasons for my decision.

## Variation on Access to the Child

#### Plaintiff Mother’s arguments

13     The Mother submitted that the Father should not have unsupervised access and overnight access to the child for the following reasons:

> (1)     Unsupervised access in the Order of Court dated 23 May 2016 is not in the best interest of the child because of \[F\]’s report (_sic email_) (dated 21 Feb 2017) to the Plaintiff’s solicitors in which she said that at their meeting with CPS on 5 January 2017[^9], it was agreed that there were “notable risks when the child goes for access” and “it was highlighted that since the custody order was issued in 2016, there has been a change of dynamics and paternal relatives that were initially identified as protective figures may not be as suitable given the current context. Therefore, CPS officers agreed to recommend another 3 months’ extension of the protection order (hoping that the police investigations can conclude) to the Youth Court at the forthcoming mention on 13 January 2017”[^10].

> (2)     That one \[G\] of Counselling and Care Centre had mentioned in a letter (of 17 .02.17) to Plaintiff counsel, that “it was highlighted during the meeting (same one taken place on 5 January 2017) that the child improved her behaviour at the child centre during the supervised access under the Child Protection Order”[^11].

> (3)     That in the Social Report dated 26 August 2016, it mentioned that the Child Abuse Review Team (“CART”) meeting convened on 4 August 2016 and attended by CPS staff, the centre supervisor, and \[H\] from \[address redacted\] FSC had discussed the concerns relating to the “allegations of harm on the child by the paternal family and the child’s presentation of sexualized behaviour”. “The meeting had recommended the child to be placed for 6 months and refer both parents to DSSA to address concerns over their conflicts with regards to their divorce and resulting impact in the child’s emotional well-being and for the child to be referred for psychological service and assessment”, “all of which did not take place”[^12]. _(this is the 4 August 2016 report note paragraph 46)_

> (4)     And at page 45 of the Social Report dated 4 August 2016 at paragraph 9.3, it was stated that “_in view of the allegations of abuse on the child by the Defendant and the paternal family_, there were also concerns over their ability to have safe contacts with the child in future and there would be a need for CP to engage the family on long-term safety plans and for the Defendant need to be referred for a psychological assessment in his ability and capacity to parent the child in view of the sexual abuse allegations raised[^13]

> (5)     Emails from the child care centre teacher/manager \[J\] stating that “at the meeting on 5 January 2017, they strongly feel that it is important for the child to have supervised access with the Father” and “that they are aware there are no concrete evidence(s) of any abuse; however … … (they) strongly advised that supervised access is the most appropriate arrangement in this matter to protect the child from harm”. \[J\] (whom she and her centre had been involved in two prior altercation incidents with the Defendant on 2 October 2015 and later on 15 June 16 (regarding allegations against the Defendant over the child’s hand dislocation incident)) [^14] had claimed that “previously when the Father was given unsupervised access the child was easily upset, threw tantrum easily and has mood swings frequently”[^15]. _(note it is not from a social worker counsellor and was based on Plaintiff letter - no details of the incidents and based on Mother allegations against the Defendant._)

> (6)     The lapsing of the protection order does not mean that unsupervised access must be reinstated[^16]

> (7)     The police investigations on the alleged sexual abuse was still pending and the police had not closed investigations. This was based on the Mother’s allegations that “the child had Urinary Tract Infection (“UTI”), constipation, constant bed wetting and ‘touched’ herself inappropriately” and that “the 4-year-old child had apparently told her that the Father had touched her in the toilet” and “that the Father and the paternal Grandmother had on separate occasions in June and in August 2016 touched on the child’s private parts in the bedroom”[^17]. Given the concerns of the CP investigations and the ongoing 4 August 2016 police case, unsupervised access and overnight access should not be reinstated[^18].

> (8)     The child had been subjected to high level of stress by parties fighting over the access and her safety. Plaintiff has made good progress to parent the child[^19], “that the child had informed the KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (“KKH”) staff that the Defendant pulled her hand because he did not like the henna on her hands”[^20].

#### Father’s Case

14     The Father alleged that all these allegations were fabricated by the Mother who had enlisted the “help of the MSF and social workers” to stop his access. He said the MSF has since closed the “child abuse” case. He added that the Mother also made repeated false reports to the police to back up her case. However, the police had also closed the case where MSF had filed the complaint. He also said the “reports/emails” (by \[F\], \[G\], child centre teacher \[J\] and \[K\]) should not be relied upon as it was improper for Plaintiff’s counsel to ask for a social report against him without the authority of a Court Order[^21]. He exhibited pictures of the child enjoying herself in activates with him and his relatives during his access times in year 2015 (before and after the date of the Ancillary Order) to show the good relationship he had with the child[^22].

15     He contended that it was unfair that he was denied access to the child because of the Mother’s actions and MSF (whose staff were “beholden to her”), which had mistakenly chosen to believe the Mother’s story. Even after the Youth Court had closed this child protection case and allowed the access to be restored to the 23 May 2016 Court Order, the Mother had, since 14 January 2017, still refused to grant him access to the Child pursuant the Court Order[^23]. He asked for his access rights to be restored immediately or in the alternative, he sought to reverse the car and control order as “the child was at risk with the Mother” and that the “Mother was using the child as a pawn against him”.[^24]

## My Decision

16     It is trite that the party who applies for a variation of a custody order on the basis of a material change in the circumstances has the burden of proving such a change. (see section 128 Women’s Charter and **_ATS v ATT_** <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGHC 156</span> at \[11\] (“**_ATS v ATT_**”, an application to vary care and control order). Notwithstanding this, even if there has been a material change in the circumstances, the Court should consider all the circumstances of the case and give paramount priority to the welfare of the child. The authorities have made it patently clear that for issues involving care and control of a child (which includes access), the first and paramount consideration is the child’s welfare (see **_CX v CY_** <span class="citation">\[2005\] 3 SLR 690</span>; <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGCA 37</span> at \[31\] – \[32\], **_APK v APL_** <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGHC 255</span>; **_ATS v ATT_** <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGHC 156</span>; and **_Soon Peck Wah v Woon Che Chye_** <span class="citation">\[1997\] 3 SLR(R) 430</span>).

17     The first issue was whether or not there had been a material change in circumstances. The Mother claimed that the child was facing discomfort and risks because of allegations of assault (purported twisting of the child’s hand”) and sexual assault (alleged touching the child’s private parts). There were very serious allegations made by the Mother. It is _trite_ the burden of proof is on the person who made the assertions to prove it on a balance of probabilities (see also the Evidence Act). The Court would need to carefully scrutinise all the evidence. In view of the seriousness of the nature of the allegations, the Court asked the MSF CPS to provide an updated Social Report and temporarily suspended the access in the Ancillary Order and, for the time being, ordered supervised visitation to ensure a “safe environment for the child” and, more importantly, to allow more proper objective observations and assessments.

18     Having read the Affidavits and the Social Reports in January and June 2017 and the DSSA reports, I find that the Mother has not proven that there was a material change for the following reasons: -

> (1)     On the totality of the evidence, I find that the weight of the evidence did not substantiate the Mother’s allegations that the Father had committed acts of arm twisting and/or sexual assault on the child (except for the Mother’s bare allegations, there was no objective or supporting evidence to support these allegations). First, these allegations were based on the Mother’s suspicions and there was no eye witness account of the alleged acts. Neither the Mother herself nor any of the teachers or social counsellors witness or observe such an incident involving the Father and the paternal Grandmother. I gleaned from reading all the documents and affidavits that it was the Mother, as the informant, who had mainly conveyed the young child’s version cum complaint to the investigators, doctors and the counsellors and she had, in my view, characterised all the allegations from her perspective. The Father, however, had vehemently denied the accusations in all his reply affidavits and in his police statements and alleged that he was framed up by the Mother to stop him from having access to the child. The affidavit evidence including the parties’ email exchanges and communication messages clearly revealed that the parties had been a very acrimonious relationship. The issue of access was, without doubt, a highly contentious matter and this was exacerbated by extensive maternal gatekeeping as the Mother persistently refused to comply with the Court Order to allow the Father access even after even after the Youth Court found that there was no longer “any significant care and protection concerns” for the child and had discharged the protection orders. Also, the SV sessions took some time to complete as the Mother was less co-operative in the scheduling of the SV sessions. During this time, she was very vocal in expressing her dissatisfaction to the counsellors/social workers on the conduct of the SV sessions whenever she was unhappy . It was more likely that the Mother had exaggerated these allegations based on her fears over the safety of the child and her unhappiness with the Father and paternal relatives. I will elaborate more on this later [^25].

> (2)     Second, the child was referred to MFS Clinical and Forensic Psychology Service (CFPS) for assessment and its report dated 4 January 2017 showed that “the child did _not_ have any trauma in relation to the reported sexual and physical abuse and the child’s behaviour such as bed wetting and emotional changes _were likely an indicator of stress perpetuated by the tenuous relationship between her parents_”. It highlighted that “there was a possibility that Mother’s rating of the child to have emotional and trauma symptoms could have been amplified due to the Mother’s anxious disposition” [^26]. The child was assessed to be “a sensitive girl who was attuned to the feelings of her parents” and seems triangulated (e.g. aligning oneself with one parent and playing one parent against the other, etc) between the parents due to their discord.[^27]. In addition, the parties were also referred on 1 July 2017 by MSF for assessment of their parenting capacity. \[L\], the Principal Counselling Psychologists engaged the parties in clinical interviews, made home visits and conduced parent-child observations over a total of 13 such sessions. The report found that “both the Father and the Mother to be attuned and loving parents to the child. The child and Mother had a positive attachment bond. The Father came across as an engaged, doting and affirming parent. The Father and the child did enjoy spending time together and they engage in positive play during their supervised access. The child was assessed to be quite attached to or “clingy” to each parent during her individual times with them. There was no indication of the child experiencing anxieties or distress around with each parent. However, the child was caught in the middle of and sometimes “confused over” the parents’ marital conflict that that had affected her emotional and behavioural functioning”. Specific examples of the child’s activities were given to substantiate that conclusion[^28]. I accepted this assessment that the child was really triangulated as a result of the parties’ conflicts and hence her account of the alleged abuses, either directly to the counsellors, or through the Mother are unlikely to be accurate and were unreliable.

> (3)     Third, the CP’s investigations into the alleged “sexual abuse” and “arm twisting” incidents were inconclusive. The police investigations into the “alleged arm twisting incident and kicking by the Father and the paternal uncle respectively” concluded in October 2016 and found the allegations to be unfounded and “_the cases were closed without further action_”[^29]. I also note from the 2 doctor’s report from KKH that when the Mother went with the child to report about the “alleged arm twisting”, she and the child gave 2 contradictory versions about this incident. The child was only accompanied by the Mother and therefore there could not be any way that the Father could have coached or influenced the child. On the first visit to the doctor Dr \[M\] on 15 June 2016 at 22.05 hrs, “_the child claimed that she fell down in the morning while she was playing_”. Although “_the child was presented to CE with upper limb pain, on evaluation at CE_ _there was no more pain and there was a full range of movement of the upper limb__. The vital signs were stable and examination of the rest of the body was unremarkable. Roentgenogram examination of the right elbow and right elbow and right wrist was unremarkable. The patient was discharged._ _Medical leave and analgesia were offered but declined by the Mother_”. The Mother made a police report about the arm twisting incident on 18 June 2016 at 4.12 pm. The next day on 19 October 2016 (4 days after the first medical examination), the Mother again brought the child to KKH told the doctor Dr \[N\] that “_the Father apparently pulled the child’s right arm_” and a medical examination “_showed there was no symptoms at the time of the presentation_”[^30]. There was no satisfactory explanation proffered by the Mother for this contradictory evidence. In my view, the Mother was attempting to bolster her police case with a doctor’s report. I gave very little weight on these allegations and I find that the allegation of physical harm was not substantiated as there was no credible evidence established against the Father for the “alleged arm twisting:” I rejected the Mother’s version on this.

> (4)     As for the alleged “sexual abuse” case, the first CP Social Report was tendered to the Youth Court Judge who then found that there were no longer safety concerns and discharged the initial protection orders on 13 January 2017. There was no appeal filed against that Youth Court order[^31]. That finding cast grave doubts over the authenticity of the Mother’s claims. In addition, the police conducted a thorough investigation into the sexual abuse allegations raised by the Mother but found that it was not substantiated and close the case and took no further action against the Father[^32]. After reviewing the affidavit evidence and the Social Reports and the DSSA reports, and given that the child had suffered no trauma, that the child was observed _not_ to experience anxieties or distress and had interacted well with the Father during the SV sessions and the fact that child, through her Mother, have given unreliable versions of an earlier event (as shown by the contradictory versions regarding the alleged physical abuse stated above), I also find that there was insufficient credible evidence to support these allegations. I therefore rejected the Mother’s allegation of sexual abuse.

> (5)     Fourth, all the arguments raised against unsupervised access as stated in the earlier Social Report in August 2016 and by the various counsellors and teachers (see \[13\] above) had all been included and considered by the updated Social Report dated 15 June 2017 (pages 6 to 9) and the Psychological Report dated 26 July 2017 (pages 1 to 3). I note the CPS’s original recommendation in January 2917 to extend the care and protection order, which recommendation was not accepted by the Youth Court, had gone on the assumption that the alleged arm twisting and sexual abuse incidents were likely to be true. However, the subsequent CPS and police investigations did not substantiate this. I have already stated above why I did not accept the allegations.

19     It is likely that all these allegations could have risen as a result of misunderstandings between the parents as a result of their marital discord. In my assessment, the Mother was prone to be quick in making allegations against the Father as shown in her affidavits and in the events that transpired from 2015 to 2018, albeit out of her own perceived fears about the child’s safety when the child was with the Father and due to her total resentment towards the Father. That Mother has an anxious disposition was also supported the counsellors’ observations and interactions with her as stated in the Social Report[^33] This was supported by the observations in the Social Report dated 15 June 2017 (page 11) that “the child would present herself differently in front of each parent and say or do things that she feels each parent would want to hear”. I accepted this assessment as it was consistent with my findings that the child’s version about the alleged arm twisting clearly showed that the child will do a “flip-flop in her story” just to please one parent (see \[18 (2)\] above).

20     In view of this, I find there has been no material change to justify a variation in the access order and that it was in the best interest of the child to resume the Father’s access to the child. As I had observed from all the affidavits’ evidence and the reports, the child had been adversely affected and was triangulated in the parents’ martial conflicts. As the Mother had contributed to this state of affairs, I was on the view that the Mother could not rely on her “wrongdoings” and “lack of co-operation” to justify a change in the access order.

21     In **_APE v APF_** <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 17</span> at \[26\] and \[30\], the High Court held that the court should always, in line with the child’s best interests, strive as far as practicable to maintain the parental bond between the child and both the custodial and non-custodial parent. Hence, unsupervised access should be awarded, unless the following exceptional circumstances were present:

> (a)     there are serious welfare concerns regarding the non-custodial parent such as violence or inappropriate parenting if the child were left unattended with the non-custodial parent;

> (b)     the child has been estranged from the non-custodial parent such that the parental-child relationship is in need of serious repair (for instance, if the child is fearful in meeting the non-custodial parent); or

> (c)     factors exist such that it is difficult for unsupervised access to be effectively implemented

22     As stated above at \[18\] to \[19\], I did not find any credible evidence to show that the Father had committed any physical harm or sexual abuse on the child from 2015 to 2017. The DSSA reports revealed that the SV sessions had proceeded smoothly. The observations revealed that “child had connected well and easily with the Father, talking and interacting throughout almost all the sessions. The child was comfortable with the Father’s presence and that the child and the Father bonded very well”[^34]. After the monitoring the parent-child interactions and assessing the parental capacity over the 32 sessions, the various counsellors’ assessments were that “there was no cause for supervised visitation to continue as the parent-child relationship have shown to be close” and the “Father seems capable of managing the child”[^35]. The Court is entitled to rely on _social welfare reports_ _ordered by the Court_ as such reports are admissible even if they contain a certain amount hearsay (_emphasis mine_): see **_Soon Peck Wah v Woon Che Chye_** <span class="citation">\[1997\] SGCA 49</span>, <span class="citation">\[1997\] 3 SLR (R) 430</span> at \[36\]. I accepted this assessment in the reports as it was supported by the objective evidence of such activities/incidents in the reports. I note that mid-way in the 4th set of SV sessions (after a break of 4 months from the earlier SV session) the “child was observed to be refraining herself from engagement with the Father. Notwithstanding this, the Father was able to calm down and attune to the child’s distress after facilitation and intervention”. It is pertinent to bear in mind that the child’s behaviour at this time was likely due to the heightened parties’ acrimonious behaviour towards each other as it coincided with the parties’ new conflict where the Mother had filed a Personal Protection Order (“PPO”) application in court in 2018 regarding the Father’s visits to the child’s kindergarten (Mother was teaching in the same kindergarten) and the parties were attending court and communicating through lawyers. Through the Mother’s insistence, the Father was not allowed to bring food/drinks and to give gifts to the child at all during the SV sessions. The child was clearly caught in between two feuding parents[^36]. However, the issue of access should not be held to ransom by the parties deliberate continuing conflict. Applying the above considerations, I find that it was in the child’s best interest that the Father (i.e., the parent without care and control) should get unsupervised access to the child.

23     I was minded to just dismiss the Mother’s application and restore the original unsupervised access order (that was temporarily suspended). I am fortified by the recommendation in the Psychological Report that the “Father should be given unsupervised access with the child to continue bolster their relationship should the sexual investigation outcome be negative or was dismissed”. However, I noted that nearly 3 ½ years had since passed and the child is now 7 years old and schooling in Primary one. When the Ancillary Order was made, the child was just 4 years old and in child care and would have usual regular afternoon naps for young children. As a result, the access time for the Father was then limited so as not to disrupt that schedule. In the interest of justice and in the best interest of the child, I rejected the Mother’s application to “vary the order to one of supervised and no overnight access” and I made minor adjustments to the timing of the dinner access and weekend day access to fit in with the primary school timetable. Thus, I allowed a 4 hours’ dinner session after school on the same Wednesday and access from 11 am to 7 pm on 1 day on weekends (with the usual alternate public holiday access). I also allow overnight access to resume gradually to allow the child to adjust after giving time to further strengthen the Father-child relationship. Hence, I ordered overnight access for half of the school holidays when the child reaches 8 years old. I therefore rejected the Mother’s application and restored unsupervised access with minor changes as stated above.

## Costs

24     As the Plaintiff Mother was legally aided at the hearing, I made no order as to costs. The Plaintiff is dissatisfied and has appealed.

_Concluding remarks_

25     In conclusion, I urge both parents to look beyond their current post-divorce impasses and conflicts and move on to co-operate and work together for the best interest of their child. Their current continuing acrimonious relationship, unless ended soon, would “likely take a significant toll on the child who will start to be caught in a loyalty conflict”. Both parents and their families ought to fully comprehend the impact of their discord on this young innocent child. It is pertinent to bear in mind that “_one parent’s or the caregiver’s personal wishes or desires for the child is not always and not necessarily the same as the best interest of the child. The Court is obliged to consider all relevant facts and circumstances of the case in determining what is in the welfare of the child._ **_The law expects parents to put the interests of the children before their own_**_”:_ See **_TAA v TAB_** <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHCF 1</span> at \[17\] and **_BNS v BNT_** <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 973</span> at \[19\] to \[21\]. It is hoped that the Mother should do some proper self-reflection and cease her gatekeeping behaviour and move away from her feelings of bitterness over the breakdown of the marriage arising from the Father’s unreasonable behaviour (initially from the Father’s alleged sexual orientation) while the Father should move on from being angry and upset with the Mother over her unfounded allegations of physical harm and sexual abuse that had separated him from the child[^37].
