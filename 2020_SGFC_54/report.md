Section 69(1A) Women’s Charter (Cap 353) – Maintenance of Incapacitated Husband

27 June 2020

### District Judge Jason Gabriel Chiang:

## I.   INTRODUCTION

1       This case presented the question of whether maintenance should be ordered to be paid by a wife to an alleged incapacitated husband and the quantum of such reasonable maintenance, if any.

2       In MSS 3776/2019, the Complainant Husband (“**Husband**”) sought that the Respondent Wife (“**Wife**”) pay monthly spousal maintenance of S$500.00 to him. At the 2nd hearing for the case, the Husband revised his request for monthly spousal maintenance upwards to S$750.00. The Wife maintained that no maintenance should be payable.

3       At the time of the hearing, parties had lived apart but were still married. The Wife intended to file for divorce but had yet to do so. Both parties were self-represented in these proceedings. The trial was conducted over 2 half-day trial hearings on 21 February 2020 and 18 March 2020.

4       At the conclusion of the trial on 18 March 2020, I held that the Husband had discharged his burden of proving that he was an “_incapacitated husband_”. I, therefore, ordered, in MO 172/2020, that the Wife pay him reasonable maintenance of S$400.00 per month to the Husband’s bank account. In this regard, such maintenance was, in essence, interim maintenance, given the Wife’s intention to proceed with divorce. However, as of the time of the reporting of this case, the Wife had yet to file for divorce.

5       On 27 March 2020, the Wife, being dissatisfied with my decision, filed an Appeal against the Orders. The full grounds of my decision are set out below.

## II.   FACTUAL MATRIX

6       The Husband and Wife were married on 3 April 2010. There were no children of the marriage. At the time of hearing, parties were already separated for over 2 years. The Husband argued that they have been separated since 4 September 2017.

7       The Husband purportedly suffered a work injury sometime in 2017 and had been on medical certificate leave since then. Sometime near the end of 2018, the Husband suffered another fall at NTUC Fairprice Supermarket, allegedly due to complications with his medication.

8       In relation to the Husband’s injuries, various medical documents were admitted into evidence, including:-

> (a)     a medical report dated 9 November 2017 from a Consultant for the Department of Psychiatry for Ng Teng Fong General Hospital (“**NTFGH**”) stating that the Husband suffered from Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood and that he was on medication for this (“**MR1**”);

> (b)     a medical report marked “_9 May 2018_” from a doctor from the Orthopaedics Department of NTFGH stating that the Husband had a left ankle injury resulting in a complete tear of his ATFL ligament and that he also had left ankle pain. The doctor highlighted that the torn ligament was permanent and that the Husband was losing his job in July 2019 as a result of his injury (“**MR2**”);

> (c)     a medical certification of work status dated 25 July 2018 signed by two (2) doctors of NTFGH stating that the Husband was “_\[p\]ermanently unfit for work due to physical impairment, educational background and adjustment disorder_” (“**MR3**”);

> (d)     a medical report dated 15 August 2018 from a Senior Consultant of the Department of Anaesthesia of NTFGH stating that the Husband had been seen by NTFGH’s pain clinic for several pain issues, including, right upper limb pain, “_numbness due to generative changes symptoms aggravated by incident at work_”, right upper back pain due to increased muscle tension and left ankle pain and that the Husband was on treatment for a psychiatric disorder. The medical report concluded by stating that “_\[b\]ased on his clinical presentation, he has incapacity to work which could be permanent_” (“**MR4**”);

> (e)     a medical report dated 9 December 2019 by a senior consultant of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery of NTFGH stating that the Husband had a primary diagnosis of “_Cervical Radiculopathy_” and other issues such as chronic back pain, chronic neck and right “_UI_” pain, left knee pain, joint pains and adjustment disorder. The doctor concluded that “_\[a\]t current state, I would state that \[the Husband\] is not fit for any kind of work permanently due to his multiple issues_” (“**MR5**”); and

> (f)     a medical report dated 13 February 2020 by a different doctor of the Orthopaedics department of NTFGH stating that they would be getting a psychiatrist assessment for further evaluation on some of the Husband’s symptoms and recommended the continuation of medication and hospitalization leave till then (“**MR6**”).

9       The Wife provided no evidence to call the medical documents into question. The Wife, however, presented draft divorce documents purportedly signed by the Husband, which were ultimately not filed.

10     The Wife had engaged the services of a law firm on 8 March 2018 to file for Uncontested Divorce Proceedings at a fixed rate. Draft divorce papers were prepared and appeared to be executed sometime after.

11     The signed Statement of Particulars was dated 2 April 2018. The Defendant’s Consent to Simplified Divorce Proceedings was executed by the Husband before a Commissioner but the document was only dated “_this 2_nd_day of 2018_” (“**Husband’s Consent to Simplified Divorce**”). The Husband confirmed that he signed this document but was unsure when this document was signed. There was also a Draft Consent Order, which was not dated (the “**Unfiled Draft Consent Order**”). This was signed by the Wife’s lawyers. Even though there was a signature on the document which was supposed to be the Husband’s and was purportedly witnessed by the same Commissioner for Oaths who had witnessed the Husband’s signing of the Husband’s Consent to Simplified Divorce, the Husband denied signing this document. The Draft Consent Order provided that the Wife waived her right to maintenance, but was silent on the Husband’s claim for maintenance. There is no indication that the Husband received any legal advice on these documents. The Husband purported that he was under the influence of medication and that an elderly lady from the law firm told him to sign and so he signed the one document.

12     In any event, these divorce papers were not filed. On 31 May 2018, the Wife received a letter from the law firm she had engaged, informing her that due to the firm’s restructuring, the firm would not be doing any uncontested divorce matters for the time being and offered a refund of the full legal fees paid (“**Lawyer’s 31 May 2018 Letter**”).

13     After the restructuring of the firm appeared to be resolved, the Wife re-engaged the same law firm to file for Uncontested Divorce Proceedings on 18 September 2018. However, by then the Husband was not agreeable to sign any divorce papers.

14     The Wife’s highest educational qualification was an ITE diploma and she worked as an Administrative and Human Resource Executive at an engineering firm. Based on the Wife’s Notices of Assessment for FY 2017 to FY 2019, including bonuses, she was earning on average between S$2,975.08 and S$3,398.08.

15     The Husband had no formal qualification for education. He had been unemployed since his accident, and had not been earning any income. While the Husband received a sum of S$36,680.00 as a one-off Work Injury Compensation, he was unable to receive pay-outs from insurance or to obtain any financial aid. The Husband claimed to have spent the whole of his Work Injury Compensation on his medical bills and other expenses and that he had insufficient funds in his bank account to maintain himself.

16     On 12 December 2019, NTFGH sent the Husband a letter of demand for outstanding medical charges and disbursements amount to S$10,150.95, which the Husband was unable to pay. By 22 February 2020, the Husband’s unpaid medical bill with NTFGH from 28 October 2019 till then had ballooned to S$12,259.25. At the time of the 2nd hearing, the Husband purported that his outstanding medical bills was over S$13,000.00.

## III.   THE ISSUES

17     In the circumstances, the key issues to be determined in this case were:-

> (a)     whether the Husband is an incapacitated husband eligible for spousal maintenance;

> (b)     what is the effect of the Unfiled Draft Consent Order; and

> (c)     in the circumstances, what would a reasonable quantum of spousal maintenance be for an incapacitated husband, if any?

## IV.   IS THE HUSBAND AN INCAPACITATED HUSBAND?

### A.   The Law

18     Pursuant to section 69(1A) of the Women’s Charter, (Cap. 353) (“**Women’s Charter**”), the Court may, on the application of an incapacitated husband, and on due proof that his wife has neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for him, order the wife to pay a monthly allowance or a lump sum for the maintenance of that husband.

19     Section 2 of the Women’s Charter defines “_incapacitated husband_” as a husband who:-

> (a)     during the marriage, is or becomes –

>> (i)       incapacitated, by any physical or mental disability or any illness, from earning a livelihood; and

>> (ii)       unable to maintain himself; and

> (b)     continues to be unable to maintain himself.

20     The inclusion of this right for an incapacitated husband to seek maintenance from his wife was introduced in the Women’s Charter (Amendment) Bill, Bill No. 6/2016. This was subsequently passed and came into effect on 1 July 2016 by way of the Women’s Charter (Amendment) Act 2016, Act No. 7 of 2016.

21     At the 2nd reading of the Women’s Charter (Amendment) Bill on 29 February 2016, then Minister for Social and Family Development, Mr Tan Chuan-Jin stated that the objective of such inclusion was as follows:-

> … The second category of maintenance is for a spouse or ex-spouse. This is the focus of the proposed amendment. Today, a woman can seek spousal maintenance from her husband or ex-husband. The law, however, does not enable men to seek spousal maintenance from their wives or ex-wives. This is something that is increasingly being questioned and debated, and my Ministry has certainly received a broad range of opinions.

> At one end of the spectrum, some Singaporeans have argued that spousal maintenance should be gender-blind and based on needs. …

> At the other end of the spectrum, there are those who feel strongly that men should be the main breadwinner – and by and large they remain so – and spousal maintenance should be reserved for women only. …

> After extensive discussions with stakeholders and internal deliberations, we have concluded that, our society is not quite fully ready for gender neutrality on spousal maintenance front …

> That said, we do feel that **_time is right for us to take a step to allow incapacitated husband and ex-husbands to apply for spousal maintenance where there is a clear need._**

> Recently, one of our divorce support specialist agencies highlighted a case they handled. This concerns a man with a professional job. He was unfortunately struck with a debilitating illness while on an overseas work assignment. The illness left him mentally incapacitated and unable to work. His wife, equally successful in her career, divorced him, and now he has no way to support himself.

> In yet another case, my Parliamentary Secretary met a male **_resident who became severely disabled after a serious work accident. His wife divorced him. He is very bitter because he has no recourse for support_**, despite years of having provided for his wife and family.

> We are **_proposing amendments that will allow, for the first time, spousal maintenance to be extended to such husbands and ex-husbands_**. This is part and parcel of the mutual help and support expected when a man and a woman enter into a marriage. Stories such as what I have shared reinforce our sense that this is one area we should do.

> We have set three clear criteria that must all be met. Only a man who is (i) **_incapacitated before or during the course of the marriage_**, (ii) **_unable to earn a livelihood and_** (iii) **_unable to support himself, therefore can claim maintenance_**. He must also be unable to support himself at the time when the maintenance application is heard.

> For clarity, I will give some **_examples which will not be covered_**. These include:

>> (i) An **_incapacitated husband or ex-husband who is able to earn a livelihood sufficient to maintain himself_**;

>> (ii) An incapacitated husband or ex-husband who has **_other means, such as income from investments or insurance pay-outs, to support himself_**; and

>> (iii) An **_ex-husband who became incapacitated after the divorce has been finalised_**.

> An ex-wife is not expected, and does not have any obligation to provide spousal maintenance if her ex-husband does not meet the criteria up to the point of divorce.

> \[emphasis added in italics and bold italics\]

22     Since the introduction of the new provisions in sections 69(1A) and 113 of the Women’s Charter, there has been a dearth of cases discussing its application. In the reported case of **_USA v USB_** **<span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHCF 5</span>** (“**_USA v USB_**”), the Honourable Judicial Commissioner Tan Puay Boon (“**JC Tan**”) at \[120\] to \[126\], discussed the law relating to the maintenance of an incapacitated ex-husband under section 113 of the Women’s Charter, but ultimately did not award maintenance to this ex-husband.

23     In **_USA v USB_**, the husband, who claimed to be incapacitated, was a lawyer who suffered from Meniere’s Disease. He alleged that he gave up his lawyering work to become a “_roving Commissioner_” earning about S$600 a month. This was allegedly because of his hearing loss, vertigo and tinnitus, which were purportedly a result of his Meniere’s Disease.

24     The wife in **_USA v USB_** contradicted the husband’s evidence by producing two (2) private investigator reports showing that the husband was able to go about a typical work day normally. At \[124\] of **_USA v USB_**, JC Tan further agreed with the wife that the medical reports submitted by the husband did not suggest that the husband was completely unable to work, but rather that he may be unable to work upon the onset of an attack of vertigo. By the husband’s own account, in a period of 3 months, he only had 6 episodes of vertigo.

25     JC Tan then concluded at \[125\] of **_USA v USB_** that:-

> 125    This is not to say that the Husband is not affected by Meniere’s Disease at all. It may well be the case that he is affected by the disease to some extent. That is, however, a different matter from whether he is incapacitated from earning a livelihood within the meaning of s 113 of the Women’s Charter. **_The ordinary meaning of the term “livelihood” is defined as “a means of securing the necessities of life”_**. I was not persuaded that the Husband had become unable to earn a means of securing the necessities of life. While the Husband’s monthly income for 2016 was a rather meagre sum of $598, I did not think that this was an accurate indicator of the Husband’s earning capacity, given that just a year before this, his monthly income was in excess of $2,000. Moreover, while one can imagine how litigation and court work may be affected by the Husband’s condition, which apparently causes hearing deterioration, I was not persuaded that Meniere’s Disease would render him unable to perform other kinds of legal work.

26     While **_USA v USB_** dealt with section 113 of the Women’s Charter relating to ex-husbands, the principles espoused would equally apply to cases involving section 69(1A) of the Women’s Charter, relating to husbands.

### B.   Application of the Law to the Facts

27     Unlike **_USA v USB_**, the Husband had at least two (2) medical reports which unequivocally stated that the Husband was permanently unfit for work due to his physical and/or mental disability. While the preliminary medical reports stop short of opining that the Husband was permanently unfit to work, the more recent medical reports went further:-

> (a)     MR3 dated 25 July 2018, which stated that the Husband was “_\[p\]ermanently unfit for work due to physical impairment, educational background and adjustment disorder_”: and

> (b)     MR5 dated 9 December 2019, which stated: “_\[a\]t current state, I would state that \[the Husband\] is not fit for any kind of work permanently due to his multiple issues_”.

28     Additionally, unlike **_USA v USB_**, there was no counter-evidence presented by the Wife to lead the Court to disbelieve the Husband’s position that he was incapacitated.

29     In this case, the Husband did not have any formal educational qualification. The work that he would have to perform, given his previous line of work, was likely to be labour-intensive. This is opposed to the husband in **_USA v USB_**. Hence, in this case, the Husband, given his medical condition, would most likely be precluded from most types of work available for someone of his educational background.

30     It is noteworthy, however, that while MR3 and MR5 stated that the Husband was permanently unfit to work, the Husband had, thus far, not qualified for insurance pay-outs. In this regard, it should be pointed out that NTUC Income and AIA Insurance made no pay-outs, as seen in the following documents:-

> (a)     in the NTUC Income documents, dated 12 October 2019, they had indicated that the Husband required maximal assistance for washing and bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring and mobility, however, the Husband was directed to undergo further review at a later date to determine if this condition was permanent for insurance pay-out purposes; and

> (b)     in the AIA letter, dated 23 January 2020, the insurance company rejected a pay-out under “_Permanent Total Disability_”. This insurance claim related to the Husband’s knee pain due to an accidental fall in December 2018. AIA considered that the Husband’s condition did not qualify as an “_injury_” based on their policy. AIA’s position in their letter was also that there appeared to be potential for the Husband to recover.

31     While these documents did cast some doubt on whether the Husband’s incapacity to work was permanent, on the totality of evidence admitted at trial, I was persuaded that the Husband had discharged his burden of proving his incapacity on a balance of probabilities. These documents were voluntarily disclosed by the Husband at the 2nd hearing, albeit with the Court’s prompting, and represented the Insurance Companies’ positions on the Husband’s status, instead of medical opinions and/or reports.

32     The fact that the Husband had been on medical certificate leave since his workplace accident in 2017 and has had no income since, was another indicator that the Husband was incapacitated from earning a livelihood, i.e. a means of securing the necessities of life.

33     While the Husband’s demeanour at trial was often brash and loud, the Court did observe that the Husband had some difficulty walking up to the witness stand and at one point during his testimony, at the 2nd hearing, the Husband began shaking and appeared to be in pain. The Court allowed him a moment before continuing on with the trial.

34     In the circumstances, with the evidence at hand, I found insufficient reason to disbelieve the Husband that he was incapacitated and permanently unable to work and generate income to maintain himself.

## V.   THE EFFECT OF THE UNFILED DRAFT CONSENT ORDER

35     Given that the Unfiled Draft Consent Order, which was silent on maintenance for the Husband, was not converted into an Order of Court, the Court can only consider it as a postnuptial agreement with respect to maintenance for the purposes of these proceedings.

36     The seminal case of **_TQ v TR_** **<span class="citation">\[2009\] 2 SLR(R) 961</span>** summarized the applicable law for agreements on maintenance at \[61\] stating that “_all postnuptial agreement with respect to maintenance are subject to the scrutiny of the court and may, in fact, even be varied if there has been any material change in circumstances_”.

37     The issue of whether an agreement had been reached in the Unfiled Draft Consent Order was a matter in contention between parties, even though, it was signed by the Wife’s lawyer on her behalf and seemingly by the Husband before a commissioner. Based on parties’ testimonies, it was undisputed that the Husband was not legally advised on the effect of the Unfiled Draft Consent Order.

38     The Husband was unsure when he signed the Husband’s Consent to Simplified Divorce and even opined that it could have been after he had received certain medical reports on his condition. However, given the date on the Statement of Particulars, I found that it strongly suggested that the Unfiled Draft Consent Order and the Husband’s Consent to Simplified Divorce were executed on 2 April 2018. In any event, it is likely that the documents were executed before the Lawyers’ 31 May 2018 Letter, as the Husband refused to sign any documents after the Wife managed to re-engage the same lawyers on 18 September 2018.

39     Since such time, the Husband would have received MR3 on 25 July 2018, MR4 on 15 August 2018 and MR5 on 9 December 2019. MR3 and MR5 unequivocally state that the Husband was permanently unfit for work. Even though the Husband had suffered injuries before the Unfiled Draft Consent Order, only on receipt of these medical reports would he be deemed permanently unfit for work. If an agreement had indeed been reached, this would have represented a material change in circumstance between when the Unfiled Draft Consent Order had been purportedly executed and the current application that this Court must take cognizant of. In the circumstances, the Court would be at liberty to vary any agreement reached in the Unfiled Draft Consent Order, given that there has been a material change in circumstances.

40     Both the injury and the medical assessment that the Husband was unfit for work occurred during the course of the subsisting marriage and qualify the Husband as an incapacitated husband.

41     Had the Uncontested Divorce Proceeding been filed and the Draft Consent Order converted into an Order of Court, we would be looking at the principles on varying a “_by consent_” order instead of the effect of a postnuptial agreement on spousal maintenance. These two (2) regimes are vastly different. However, the uncontested divorce proceedings were never filed.

42     It is further pertinent to note that the Husband’s Consent to Simplified Divorce only provides the Husband’s consent for the Wife to file for Simplified Divorce on the basis of the Unfiled Draft Consent Order within 12 months of the date of the Husband’s Consent to Simplified Divorce (i.e. by 14 April 2019 at the latest). No divorce proceedings were filed during this window of time. Additionally, with effect from 18 January 2019, the Family Justice Courts Practice Directions Amendment No. 1 of 2019 provided revised guidelines for draft consent orders, which required under paragraph 116(5)(b)(iii) of the Family Justice Practice Directions that an unrepresented party must include an endorsement under his signature stating: “_I acknowledge that I have considered the terms of the agreement and have also been informed of my right to seek independent legal advice_”. This endorsement is absent from the Unfiled Draft Consent Order and this document would have been rejected even if the Wife had filed this after 18 January 2019. Such issues further detract from the Wife’s reliance on the Unfiled Draft Consent Order.

## VI.   REASONABLE MAINTENANCE FOR THE INCAPACITATED HUSBAND

### A.   The Law

43     It is undisputed that the Wife did not provide any maintenance to the Husband and was further maintaining that she did not need to provide him any maintenance. Hence, section 69(1A) of the Women’s Charter is satisfied to the extent that the Wife had neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the Husband.

44     In determining the quantum of reasonable maintenance payable by a wife to an incapacitated husband, Section 69(4) of the Women’s Charter provides that the court shall have “_regard to all circumstances of the case_”, including the following matters:-

> (a)     the financial needs of the incapacitated husband;

> (b)     the income, earning capacity (if any), property and other financial resources of the incapacitated husband;

> (c)     any physical or mental disability of the incapacitated husband;

> (d)     the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage;

> (e)     the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family;

> (f)     the standard of living enjoyed by the incapacitated husband before his wife neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for him; and

> (g)     the conduct of each of the parties to the marriage, if the conduct is such that it would in the opinion of the court be inequitable to disregard it.

45     The purpose of maintenance under section 69 of the Women’s Charter is a modest one of helping the spouse tide over a period of financial distress. See **_Foo Ah Yan v Chiam Heng Chow_** **<span class="citation">\[2012\] 2 SLR 506</span>** at \[22\] and **_AXM v AXO_** **<span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 705</span>** at \[16\] as applied in **_TEM v TEN_** **<span class="citation">\[2014\] SGDC 238</span>** at \[20\].

### B.   Application of the Law to the Facts

46     While the Husband earned no income, the Wife alleged that she was earning a nett monthly income of about S$2,180.00. However, considering the Wife’s Notices of Assessment, including her bonuses and overtime pay, the Wife earned at least S$2,975.08 and potentially, even S$3,398.08, per month on average.

47     The Wife claimed to have monthly expenses of S$2,488.93, which exceeded her claimed nett monthly income of S$2,180.00. Having considered the Wife’s evidence, I held that the Wife’s reasonable monthly expenses to be S$1,843.93 instead of S$2,488.93 as calculated in the following table:

48     In this regard, the Wife’s claims for monthly telephone expenses of S$130.00 a month were unsubstantiated by her sample bills and was thus reduced. On the witness stand, it was established that the Wife resided with her parents, as such, she did not pay for electricity, water, gas, conservancy charges, internet or cable charges, instead she gave her parents a larger allowance. As such, a higher amount was accounted for the allowance of the Wife’s parents and no sums were attributed to the items that the Wife, in fact, did not pay for. I found the Wife’s expenditure for eating out and entertainment to be high and decided to match it to the Husband’s claimed sums for these items, which I found more reasonable.

49     Therefore, the Wife did have some financial capacity to assist in the maintenance of the Husband, who I determined to be incapacitated. Even if I were to accept the Wife’s claimed expenses, in full, based on her average monthly income, she would still have at least S$400 to spare each month.

50     The Husband claimed to have monthly expenses of S$5,967.50, but I largely found such claims to be unsubstantiated and/or exaggerated. I found that a more reasonable sum of his monthly expenses to be S$2,395.00, according to the following table:-

51     The Husband’s claim for telephone expenses was unsupported by his bill, as such I reduced it to match a reasonable sum close to that of his last billed amount. There was no evidence that the Husband was paying for cable or internet, these sums were thus disallowed. The Husband’s claim for food and groceries included his mother’s share, which the Wife is not expected to pay for, as such, I apportioned a more reasonable amount of S$400.00 a month instead. At the trial, the Husband stated that he no longer paid for personal insurance, as such, that sum was removed. For cigarettes, I found this sum to be high and adjusted it downwards. With regard to the Husband’s claimed monthly medical expenses of S$3,000, I found this sum to be exaggerated. Based on the Husband’s outstanding bill for the month of January 2020, his medical expenses were estimated to be a monthly sum of about S$700.00. The Husband’s reasonable expenses were thus less than half of what the Husband had claimed and was reduced accordingly.

52     Based on the Husband’s bank documents, the Husband did not have any savings to assist in the payment of his monthly expenses. The Husband’s bank balance in his bank passbook indicated that he only had S$198.57 as of 25 February 2020. His CPF documents showed that his CPF had largely been depleted as well.

53     It should be noted that, at the time of the 2nd hearing, the Husband appeared to have about S$13,000 of medical debts owed to NTFGH.

54     In the circumstances, given the Husband’s needs and the Wife’s capacity to help support him, a monthly spousal maintenance of S$400.00 was deemed a reasonable sum that the Wife would be able to afford, in the interim, to assist the Husband in tiding over his financial distress. Such maintenance payments were ordered to begin on 31 March 2020, payable to the Husband’s bank account. Given the Husband’s recurring medical expenses and medical debt, the sum of S$400.00 would not come close to paying off all of his expenses and debt but would, at least, provide some assistance in meeting his immediate needs.

55     It is pertinent to note that the Wife had informed the Court that she intended to file for divorce even if the Husband did not consent to an Uncontested Simplified Divorce. While MO 172/2020 did not specify when such maintenance should cease, the Wife is not expected to indemnify the Husband’s costs permanently. Such maintenance is only ordered in the interim to help the Husband tide over pending a further determination in the divorce proceedings.

## VII.   CONCLUSION

56     In this case, on a balance of probabilities, I found that the Husband had discharged his burden of proving that he was permanently incapacitated from working and earning a living. As such, reasonable interim maintenance of S$400.00 per month was ordered to be paid by the Wife to the Husband.

57     As the Wife had indicated that she would be filing for divorce, the issue of the Husband’s maintenance could be reassessed at such a juncture.
