Family Law – Child Orders – Sole Custody – Joint Custody – Care and Control – Access – Relocation – Best Interests of the child

26 July 2019

### District Judge Suzanne Chin:

## Introduction

1       The case before me concerned a contested application for interim orders for custody, care and control and access to 2 very young children of the marriage as well as the relocation of the children to the United Kingdom (“UK”). The Mother had applied for interim custody and care and control of the children and requested for leave to permanently relocate with the children from Singapore to the UK. She also requested for consequential access orders. This was resisted by the Father who filed his own application in respect of custody, care and control and access.

2       After hearing from the parties and considering the evidence tendered, I made orders as follows:

> i.      _There shall be joint custody of the 2 children of the marriage, B and C. Parties are to consult with each other and jointly make decisions on all custodial matters including but not limited to their education, their medical care, religion, place of residence etc._

> ii.      _The Mother shall have care and control of B and C._

> iii.      _The Father shall have access as follows:_

>> (a)        _Weekly access on Friday from 3pm to 6pm;_

>> (b)        _Weekly overnight access from Saturdays at 1pm to Sundays 7pm;_

>> (c)        _Alternate public holidays from 6pm the day before till 7pm of the public holiday;_

>> (d)        _An aggregate total of half of all school holidays; and_

>> (e)        _Reasonable telephone access from 6pm to 6.30pm daily on non-access days_

>> _Access in paragraph 3(d) shall take precedence, followed by access in paragraph 3(c), then access in paragraphs 3(a) and (b)._

> iv.      _The above access times are to be strictly adhered to. If the child is ill and cannot be handed over for access to the Father, the Mother shall provide to the Father no less than 4 hours’ notice and provide a medical certificate to the Father. The Father shall then be entitled to make up access to be mutually agreed between the parties._

> v.      _The Father shall ensure that no other third party is present during his access to the children. For the avoidance of doubt, this paragraph shall also apply if the Father is exercising access at a location that is not his place of residence – in such a situation, the Father shall not be accompanied by any third party or arrange to meet any third party during his access if the children are present. This paragraph shall not apply to the Father’s domestic helper, family members and parents of the children’s friends accompanying the said friends on a playdate taking place during the Father’s access. Where the Father is required to have any third party in his rented premises or to meet any third party outside his rented premises whilst the children are present, this shall be permitted if the third party’s presence is necessary or expedient for the running or management of the Father’s household. This includes, but is not limited to, deliveries, maintenance or other work on the apartment, or other situations where the Father is receiving assistance or services from third parties. The Father shall in any event ensure that his new romantic partner(s) are not present during his access to the children._

> vi.      _The same restriction in paragraph 5 above shall apply to the Mother save that references to access shall be construed to refer to the time when the children are in the Mother’s care._

> vii.      _Should the Father’s offer of employment from his current employer not be confirmed on or before 10 June 2019 (as a result of (a) his employers not receiving satisfactory references or (b) his medical assessment not being satisfactory to his employers (“conditions”), the Mother shall be allowed to relocate with the children to the United Kingdom after the expiry of 14 days from that date. In this regard, the Father shall provide to the Mother written confirmation from his employer that he has fulfilled all of the above stated conditions and his employment is no longer subject to the conditions. Save as stated herein, the Mother’s application for relocation is dismissed._

> viii.      _The passports of the children shall be retained by the Mother for safekeeping._

> ix.      _The Father shall pay the Mother costs fixed at S$5,000._

3       Both parties have filed appeals against parts of my orders. The Mother has appealed against my dismissal of her relocation application and my consequential orders granting liberal weekly access to the Father. The Father has essentially appealed against my orders on care and control and access. I set forth below my reasons for making such orders.

## Background facts

4       The Father, a British citizen is 44 years of age and works as a Senior Business Analyst. The Mother, also a British citizen, is 39 years old and was at the time of the hearing not working. She is however a qualified teacher and taught at a secondary school in the UK. There are 2 children from the marriage - a daughter who is 5 years old and a son aged 3. They too are British citizens.

5       The parties married on xx August 2012 and resided in the UK until the end of 2017. Sometime in 2017, after having been out of work for some months while living in London, the Father found a job in Singapore and moved from London to Singapore in October 2017. The Mother and the 2 children joined him shortly thereafter moving to Singapore on 27 December 2017.

6       On 2 June 2018, the Mother left Singapore with the 2 children without the Father’s knowledge or consent and returned to the UK. This prompted the Father to take out an application under the Hague Convention in the UK for the return of the children to Singapore. Eventually, parties were able to reach a consensus and a consent order was recorded in the UK on 28 August 2018. Following this, the Mother and the children returned to Singapore. On 24 September 2018, the Mother filed her current application (OSG 195/2018) requesting for orders on interim custody, care and control of the 2 children as well as leave to relocate with the children to the UK. The Father filed OSG 203/2018 on 8 October 2018 praying for alternative positions of (a) sole custody and sole care and control; (b) joint custody and sole care and control; and (c) joint custody and shared care and control. He also resisted the Mother’s application for leave of the court to relocate to the UK.

## Custody, Care and Control

7       As mentioned above, I made orders granting joint custody of the children to the parties with sole care and control to the Mother. As neither party has lodged an appeal against my decision to grant joint custody of the children to the parties, I shall focus only on my reasons for granting sole care and control of the 2 children to the Mother.

## The law on custody, care and control

8       Section 3 of GIA states as follows:

> “Where in any proceedings before any court the custody or upbringing of an infant or the administration of any property belonging to or held in trust for an infant or the application of the income thereof is in question, the court, in deciding that question, shall regard _the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration_ and save in so far as such welfare otherwise requires the father of an infant shall not be deemed to have any right superior to that of the mother in respect of such custody, administration or application nor shall the mother be deemed to have any claim superior than that of the father.”

Section 5 of the GIA states further that:

> “The court may, upon the application of either parent or any guardian appointed under this Act, make orders as it may think fit regarding the custody of such infant, the right of access thereto and the payment of any sum towards the maintenance of the infant and may alter, vary or discharge such order on the application of either parent or of any guardian appointed under this Act.”

Section 11 of the GIA:

> “The court or a judge, in exercising the powers conferred by this Act, shall have regard primarily to _the welfare of the infant_, and shall, where the infant has a parent or parents, consider the wishes of such parent or both of them, as the case may be.

> In _IW v IX \[2005\]_ 1 SLR (R) 135 Chao Hick Tin JA delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal held at \[26\] that:

>> “It is clear to us that the paramount consideration in every case where custody is in issue is the welfare of the child. That is the immutable principle. The term “welfare” should be taken in its widest sense and we do not think it is possible or desirable to define it. In _Tan Siew Kee v Chua Ah Boey_ \[1987\] SLR (R) 725, Chan Sek Keong JC (as he then was), in reference to the term “welfare”, said (at \[12\]):

>>> . . . It means the general well-being of the child and all aspects of his upbringing, religious, moral as well as physical. His happiness, comfort and security also go to make up his well-being. A loving parent with a stable home is conducive to the attainment of such well-being. It is not to be measured in monetary terms.”

> His Honour went to elucidate at \[27\]:

>> “What would be in the interests of the child must necessarily depend on all the circumstances of the case . . . Other factors will include the home environment and care arrangements made for the child, the conduct of the parties, and the wishes of the child. We must reiterate that this enumeration is not meant to be exhaustive. The court will have to carry out a balancing exercise to determine, as between the two parents, to whom custody should be given in the best interests of the child. A factor which may be determinant in one case may not necessarily be so in another. So the weight to be given to each factor may vary from case to case. No precise formulation is possible. This is not a scientific exercise but one of judgment.”

9       It was as such clear that in making a decision in this case, the welfare of the children would be “the golden thread” “that takes its place as the court’s focal (indeed paramount) concern….” _(BNS v BNT_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 187</span>_)._

## The Mother’s position

10     The Mother wanted sole care and control of the children to be granted to her. It was her submission that an order for shared care and control was inappropriate in the circumstances in light of the acrimony between the parties and their inability to cooperate. She referred to various instances to support her contention of the Father’s focus on “winning” and being “correct” rather than on the children’s best interests[^1]. Her position was that an order for sole care and control would be in the children’s best interests and bearing in mind that she had been the primary caregiver of the children throughout their lives, sole care and control of the 2 children should be granted to her. As she was currently unemployed, she claimed to be the parent perpetually present for the children, at least for the entire time whilst they have been in Singapore. She also referred to the tender ages of the children and called for the court to recognise the importance of the maternal bond. In contrast, she claimed that the Father was absent for a lot of the time as he worked very long hours both while the parties were in the UK and also after their move to Singapore. She maintained further that the Father prioritises his activities and interests over the children’s wellbeing and is unwilling and unable to care for the children on weekdays.

## The Father’s position

11     The Father drew the court’s attention to the fact that the Mother had surreptitiously left Singapore with the children to return to the UK. Thereafter, he contended that she had been restrictive in allowing him access to the children both during the time when they were still in the UK[^2] when he had to make special arrangements to fly to the UK as well as after their return to Singapore[^3]. He contended further that she had been attempting to alienate the children from him and discouraging them from spending time with him[^4]. He also questioned her ability to look after the children on her own maintaining that when the parties lived together, he often had to return home early when the Mother wanted to attend her exercise classes or go out with her friends. He also referred to her negligence and her inability to properly supervise the children[^5].

## Decision on care and control

12     I proceeded to consider each of the factors that would be relevant in determining the best interests of the child.

#### Primary Care giver

13     Based on the current facts, it was clear that the Mother has been a stay at home Mum ever since parties arrived in Singapore. When the domestic helper was hired, she may have had the support and help of the domestic helper but she was the stay at home parent who obviously had more time to spend with the children. The Father on the other hand being the sole breadwinner, had the task of making sure that he performed in his new job so that he could provide for the family. The evidence pointed to the fact that the Father was doing his best to succeed in his job and consequentially provide for the family. This naturally would mean that he would be left with less time to spend with the children. Notwithstanding, I drew the conclusion that he was not an absent Father as the Mother had described him to be in her submissions. By the Mother’s own evidence, she admitted that: (a) the Father did help change the children’s diapers, dress then and help care for them at times, sometimes even taking time off work[^6]; (b) notwithstanding his long working hours while in Singapore, the Father would come home “once or twice a week during weekdays” for the children’s bath time[^7]; (c) the Father would sometimes look after the children on his own when she went out for her own activities for a half day[^8]; (d) the Father regularly played with the children outside for an hour[^9]; (e) the Father went swimming with the children at the pool at his residence[^10]; (f) the Father took the children for walks with the family dog and to the Singapore zoo and to Sentosa[^11]; and (g) the Father co-parented with the Mother in disciplining the children[^12] and took time to teach the children the French language[^13]. In light of all of this, I did not accept the Mother’s portrayal of the Father as an uninvolved parent. I also noted the various evidence exhibited by the Father showing that the Mother did rely on him to care for the children whenever she attended her own activities like book club and various fitness classes. From a practical perspective, the Mother clearly had more time to spend with the children and has been their main caregiver in that regard. I was of the view however that the Father has also been a very involved parent notwithstanding the constraints on his time as imposed by his long working hours.

#### Tender ages of the children

14     While it is trite law that there is no presumption towards granting care and control of younger children to their mother, I was cognizant of the tender ages of the children in question and the principle laid down in _Soon Peck Wah v Woon Che Chye_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 3 SLR(R) 430</span> that all other things being equal, when dealing with a young child, the maternal bond between the mother and the infant was pivotal. This was as such a factor that weighed in favour of care and control being granted to the Mother.

#### Proposed Care arrangements of each parent

15     I also ventured to compare each parent’s proposed care arrangements. The Mother is currently not working. From all accounts however, she does intend to work on a part time basis until the younger child goes to school. Taking into consideration the current circumstances before me, with the Mother being a stay at home mother, I was of the view that she would be able to spend time with the children and attend to their needs personally. Even if she were to find a part time job, it would be likely that she would only have to work during school hours and would still have the flexibility of spending more time with the children. In contrast, the Father in his earlier job had worked full time and on weekdays worked at least until 7pm if not later. He is currently in a new job which will probably have a similar work schedule. In support of his prayer for shared care and control, the Father proposed that when he is not around, he would have the support of his domestic helper who can take care of the children. His proposal for shared care and control was for the children to be in his care from Thursday 5pm to Monday 9am. While I note that the Father has stated that the children will only be left with the domestic helper for a couple of hours on Thursday and Friday before he is released from work, I also am aware that the work demands may require the Father to be away from the children longer than anticipated and this may result in the children being left with the domestic helper. I agree with the Mother’s counsel that time with a domestic helper is not an adequate substitute for parental care especially when the Mother is available to spend time with the children.

##### Children’s relationship with both parents

16     It was not disputed that the children have a good relationship with each parent and this is something to be preserved. I examined the allegations of the Father with regard to the Mother’s attempts to alienate the children from him and her denial of access to him. While I do not consider there to be sufficient evidence for me to make a determination as to the mother’s attempts to alienate the children, I did find that the Mother had not been as cooperative and reasonable as she could have been with regard to allowing the Father access to the children. The mirror orders which the parties entered into by consent upon the Mother’s return to Singapore in September 2018, required the parties to agree to access arrangements in writing. Over the last 4 months however, it appears that parties have not been able to come to any agreement specifically on overnight access. The Mother has raised different concerns each time making arrival at any conclusion difficult. I also noted that given the fact that she has stated that she understands the importance of the children having a relationship with the Father, she has not granted him much access to the children given his working hours and specifically not allowed him overnight access.

#### Decision on care and control

17     I first considered whether an order of shared care and control would be in the children’s best interests in this case. In this regard, on the issue of shared care and control, I found the observations of Valerie Thean JC (as she then was) in _BNS v BNT <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 213</span>_ instructive_:_

> “\[75\] .. Indeed, given the nature of the responsibilities and the kinds of decisions that have to be made under a care and control order, courts are far more concerned with the issue of workability and the potentiality for stress on the children when dealing with care and control than when dealing with custody.”

> She referred further to the Court of Appeal’s observations in CX v CY (at \[76\]) that “a joint care and control order, requiring parties to agree on every day-to-day decision relating to the child, is unworkable where the parties have a bitter relationship with each other” and “would likely create a great deal of stress for the children at the centre of the tussle”.

18     In this case, the concern that a shared care and control order “would require the parties to agree on every day to day decision relating to the child and this is likely to create great deal of stress for the children who would be at the centre of the tussle” was in my view a likely scenario. With the parties’ inability to agree and work together at this point in time, returning to the courts to litigate on matters would be an added likelihood which would not be in the interests of the children. Taking all of the above into consideration, and based on the current circumstances where the Mother is not working (or even if she were to find a job it would likely be on a part time basis), I was of the view that an order for shared care and control would not be in the best interests of the children.

19     It would follow from the above that an order for sole care and control would make more sense in the circumstances. Weighing the Father’s proposed care plan which would require the children to be with the domestic helper where the Father was absent against the fact that they had a parent (the Mother) who loved them and with whom they are familiar, ready and available to spend time with them, and taking into consideration the tender ages of the children, I found that it would be in the best interests of the children for sole care and control to be granted to the Mother. While I am cognizant of the Father’s concerns that the Mother has hindered his access to the children, I am of the view that clearly defined access orders will address these concerns. My orders for access are detailed below but I first turned to addressing the Mother’s application for relocation to the UK.

## Relocation

## The Mother’s case

20     The Mother’s application for a permanent relocation to the UK was keenly contested by the Father. It was her position that the move to Singapore was intended to be a temporary trial with the parties never intending to move permanently to Singapore. According to her, the intention had always been for the parties to eventually relocate back to the UK. While she acknowledges that she had initially agreed to the move to keep the family together, she asserted that since the marriage has broken down and since the move had been intended to be temporary, she should be allowed to relocate to the UK with the children. She emphasised the following in support of her position:

> a.     That she would be in a better position to care for the children in the UK than she would be in Singapore as she has a property in the UK and will not have to live in a rented place;

> b.     That the move to Singapore was temporary;

> c.     That both children are UK citizens born in the UK and the total amount of time they have spent in Singapore has been only 6 months. Accordingly, their habitual residence is in the UK;

> d.     That the children have reserved places in a school in the UK and the school is a 5 minute drive from her UK property. She has also has a car which the Father had purchased for her;

> e.     That she has a very strong support network in the UK with her mother, stepfather, brother and 2 step brothers and if she were to be allowed to relocate with the children to the UK, the children would be able to maintain good relationships with her extended family. She also has many friends in the UK and has no support network in Singapore.

> f.     That if the Father decides to cut off financial support, she can fall back on state sponsored welfare and other benefits in the UK. She would also be better placed to find a job in the UK as opposed to Singapore.

> g.     That if she were to be allowed to relocate to the UK, she would facilitate access by the Father as she has facilitated access his in Singapore. She is also agreeable to his request for access of 25 days in aggregate subject to a condition.

## The Father’s case

21     The Father argued that the Mother had not been clear about her motivations for moving to the UK and the reasons she had put forward were not reasonable nor were they in the best interests of the children. He also argued that with the move to Singapore, the parties had intended to live in Singapore for the long term. He challenged her relocation plans arguing that the Mother’s proposal was not to move the children back to London where they had lived all of their lives prior to moving to Singapore but to move them to Portslade, Brighton where she owned a property. He was of the view that rather than considering the best interests of the children, her motivation was her own convenience. The Father also drew the court’s attention to the close bond he shares with both children and the likely loss of relationship they would suffer should the relocation be allowed.

## The Law on Relocation

22     In considering an application for relocation, a court must seek to strike a balance between the competing tensions of upholding one parent’s freedom to relocate and the child’s interest in maintaining a relationship with both parents. While earlier cases had placed emphasis on the reasonableness of the custodial parent’s reasons for relocation and considered this determinative, it has been noted in recent years that the primary principle to be applied in relocation cases is that the welfare of the child is paramount.

23     In _BNT v BNS_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 859</span> at \[16\] (“_BNT v BNS_”), commenting on the earlier observations made by the Court of Appeal in _Re C_ \[2003\]1 SLR (R) 502 _(“Re C”)_ as to the reasonableness of the custodial parent’s reasons for the relocation being determinative, the Honourable Judith Prakash J noted as follows:

> “In my view, the only applicable principle of law in relocation cases is that the welfare of the child is the paramount and overriding consideration: _AZB v AZY_ at \[20\]. _Re C_ should not be understood as suggesting anything contrary. In fact, it expressly accepts this principle. The suggestion that the reasonable wishes of the primary care giver are ‘determinative’ must be understood within this context.

This view was supported by the Court of Appeal in _BNS v BNT_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGCA 23</span> (“_BNS v BNT”)_ where it was emphasised that:

> “… there is only one fundamental - indeed critical - legal principle upon which everything else (including the ultimate decision of the case itself) depends. And it is this – in considering relocation applications, the welfare of the child is paramount and this principle ought to override any other consideration.”

24     In addition to the above, 2 further principles are worth noting:

> (a)     that there is no legal presumption in favour of allowing relocation when the primary caregiver’s desire to relocate is not unreasonable or founded in bad faith; and

> (b)     that it is in the child’s best interest to continue to have a meaningful relationship with both his or her mother and father notwithstanding that their relationship has broken down.

25     The court is accordingly tasked to determine the best interests of the child in the circumstances and is obliged to consider all relevant facts and circumstances in each individual case in determining what is in the welfare of the particular child. Some of the factors considered include the financial security and financial support of the relocating parent back home, the fact that the relocating parent had an extended family and support networks back home, remarriage to a new spouse who was already settled in that other country. (See _AZB v AYZ_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 627</span>; _ATC v ATD_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGDC 254</span>; _AYD v AYE_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGHC 42</span>.)

26     As noted by Andrew Phang JA in _BNS v BNT_:

> “… this is ultimately a _fact-centric exercise_ which involves the balancing of all the relevant facts and circumstances of the case, although it is of first importance to reiterate that the ultimate decision of the court must be based on _the welfare of the children (which is the paramount consideration)_….”

## Relevant factors that I considered in my decision on relocation

## Mother’s reasons for relocation

27     The Mother cited various reasons and I shall consider each of these in turn below.

#### (a)   Mother would be better placed to care for the children in the UK

28     The Mother claimed that she would be better placed to care for the children in the UK property which she owns. She claims that if she stays in Singapore, she would have to depend on the Husband to pay for the rental of an apartment here in Singapore. It was unclear to me upon examination of the evidence how the Mother would be in a better position to care for the children in the UK property which she owns in contrast to a rented property that is paid for by the Father. It is not disputed that the UK property continues to be subject to a mortgage and the Mother will have to make payments periodically towards this, an added pressure. The Mother asserts that she will have no issues with making mortgage payments should she be allowed to return to the UK but did not clarify how she would do this. Presumably, she will have to find a job so that she will have enough income to make the mortgage payments for this UK property. In contrast, if the Mother and children stay on in Singapore, the rented premises will be fully paid for by the Father as is the current situation and so long as his obligations to continue are encapsulated in maintenance orders, she will have the assurance of a place to stay. In light of this, I did not consider this to be a factor in favour of relocation.

29     I also noted that the family resided in London before moving to Singapore and the children have never resided in the Mother’s UK property in Portslade. If relocation were to be allowed, the children would have to make adjustments to this new environment.

#### (b)   Move to Singapore was temporary

30     The Mother contends that the move to Singapore was only on a trial basis and she only packed for an overseas trip. Notwithstanding, upon examination of the evidence before me, it appeared that when the parties first moved to Singapore, the intention of the parties was to at least stay in Singapore for the duration of the term of the Father’s employment otherwise the parties would not have incurred substantial costs for moving the family belongings and dog to Singapore, purchased additional furniture and large personal items like bicycles for the children.[^14] I also noted that upon arrival in Singapore, amongst other things, the parties employed a domestic helper for a 2 year contract in April 2018[^15], the Mother accepted a position as a supply teacher in Singapore and committed to running the Brownies team at the school when term started in September 2018[^16], and the Mother signed up for a 12 month gym membership on 4 May 2018. All of these appeared to contradict the Mother’s contentions that the move to Singapore was to have been temporary. The Father had been out of a job in the UK for several months prior to their move and when he had successfully found employment in Singapore the parties moved with the children to Singapore. In light of this and based on the evidence before me, I drew the conclusion that while the parties had not intended to remain in Singapore permanently, the parties had contemplated being in Singapore for a period that was more than temporary. It would not have made sense to uproot the entire family for a brief period of 6 months and for the Father to try out a job for 6 months. The evidence pointed more to the conclusion that the parties had committed to trying out the move to Singapore for at least the duration of the Father’s employment in Singapore. It seemed however that after the parties’ relationship broke down, the Mother decided that there was nothing for her in Singapore and she wanted to return to the UK.

31     The Mother also argued that the habitual residence of the children was in the UK while the Father took the position that habitual residence of the children was not a factor relevant in the enquiry relating to relocation. I agreed with the Father’s counsel that habitual residence is a concept applied in International Child Abduction Act cases and is not relevant in relocation cases.

#### (c)   Strong Support Network and ties to the UK

32     It was not disputed that both parties did not have a support network of family in Singapore. The Mother maintained that she would have the support of her family and friends in the UK and in contrast to the situation in Singapore where she does not have a close network of friends. It was the Mother’s evidence that she felt homesick and wanted to return to the UK. With regard to the issue of family support, while I accepted that the Mother had family in the UK, the evidence did not show that the children had spent much time with her extended family. From all of the Mother’s accounts, the Mother’s extended families were not caregivers to the children and the children only saw them over the Christmas period. The only exception may have been the Mother’s mother. I noted however that she has visited Singapore 3 times over the past year and has been a source of support to the Mother. Going forward this support continues to be available to the Mother even if she were to remain in Singapore.

33     The Mother also says that she does not have a close network of friends in Singapore but the evidence appears to point to the fact that she does have a network of friends (albeit not as close as she may like) who are prepared to help out with the children where necessary. She also has a social network and regularly arranges for playdates for the children. Taking into consideration the short period of time the Mother has spent here, the network she has been able to establish is admirable.

#### (d)   The Mother can fall back on state sponsored welfare and other benefits in the UK and will and able to find a job in the UK.

34     The Mother referred to the state sponsored welfare and other benefits in the UK and asserted that she would have access to these should the Father decide to cut off financial support to her. Firstly, I would say that nothing in the evidence points to the likelihood of the Father cutting off financial support for the mother. The parties had entered into a consent order in relation to payment of maintenance and no submissions have been made by the Mother about the Father failing to make such payment at any point in time. The allegation of the insufficiency of the maintenance paid by the Father is a different issue altogether and if the Mother considers that what the Father is paying is insufficient, there are avenues for her to pursue this further. I would emphasise that the current maintenance amount was consented to by the parties. The Father holds a high paying job in Singapore and can certainly maintain the children and the Mother in a comfortable lifestyle. In contrast, it was not disputed that he was not employed for the months predating their move to Singapore and presumably was only able to find employment in Singapore at the time, hence the move by the entire family to Singapore. For the reasons stated above, I did not consider this as a factor in favour of relocation.

35     The Mother says that she is able to find a job in the UK easily. It would appear from the facts that she is also able to find a job in Singapore as she was offered and she did accept the offer to work in one of the international schools in Singapore. She has stated on affidavit that if she were to be allowed to return to the UK, she does not intend to work full time until the younger child goes to school which means that she only intends to look for a part time job. This is precisely the profile of the job she had secured in Singapore before she left for the UK in June 2018.

36     I also considered the Father’s employment status and the aspect of financial security in Singapore. During the hearing, the Father claimed that while the contract stated that his employment was at least for 1 year, his employer had indicated to him that his position is ear marked for the next 3 years at a minimum. Shortly after the hearing, however, the Father informed the court that his contract with his then employer which had previously been up to December 2019 had been terminated with effect from 5 April 2019. He indicated subsequently that he had received an offer on 29 March 2019 for a temporary 3 month contract which he had at the time accepted. On 30 April, he again through counsel informed the court that the temporary contract had been converted to a permanent contract effective on 1 May 2019. The point is that the Father has now found permanent employment in Singapore which will allow him to earn a substantial salary. Although this is still subject to his employer receiving satisfactory references and the successful completion of the required medical assessment, this job will allow him to provide in the foreseeable future financial stability for the family.

#### Whether the Mother’s reasons are reasonable

37     The evidence appears to point to the fact that the Mother had initially moved to Singapore not on a temporary basis as she claims. It was only after the relationship between the parties broke down that she decided that there was no reason for her to remain in Singapore. In the circumstances, I did not find the Mother’s reasons for relocation reasonable. While I appreciate that she may feel homesick and would prefer to return to her friends and family in the UK, I agreed with the Father that this was not a valid reason for relocating the children.

## The children’s education

38     While the Mother has said that the children have places in the UK, I noted that the Father has also shown that the children could start school in Singapore in the French school at any time. The Father has asserted that the UK schools the mother has enrolled the children into are not good schools. While I am no in a position to comment on this, it would appear that the schools in the UK proposed by the Mother have been chosen not so much based on how highly ranked they are or what reputation they have but more because they are close to her UK property. This led me to conclude that in enrolling the children in these schools, the Mother was more focused on the issue of her own convenience rather than the best interests of the children and I did not think that this factor weighed in favor of relocation. Both children are still very young and it is not imperative that they return to the UK immediately to start school especially if they have the opportunity to be exposed to an international bilingual environment at a very young age. In fact, as the Mother had noted herself, this would provide the children with good opportunity to be immersed in an environment where they would be given the chance to learn several languages and be exposed to an international community.

## Relationship with the left behind parent – the Father

39     This is a factor that has been highlighted in recent years as being relevant in assessing the welfare of the child is the child’s loss of relationship with the left behind parent. It has been a long accepted principle that a child benefits from the nurturing presence and joint contribution of both parents in his or her life and this does not cease to be true upon the breakdown of marriage. In this case, to both parent’s credit, it was undisputed that both children have a good relationship with both parents. It is also evident to this court from this highly contested fight in these applications, that both parents love the children dearly.

40     I had determined earlier that while the Mother was by virtue of circumstances the children’s primary care giver, the Father’s involvement with the children has also been integral throughout their lives, at least until June 2018 when the mother took them from the matrimonial home to the UK. All things considered, I was of the view that the bond between the children and their Father is a strong bond and if I were to allow the relocation, the resultant void in the children’s lives would leave a negative impact on them.

41     The Mother says that if she were to be allowed to relocate, she would facilitate access by the Father as she has facilitated access his in Singapore. She is also agreeable to his request for access of 25 days in aggregate subject to a condition. In this regard, I note that the Father had asked for 25 days of access as this is the maximum number of days he has in his current job. Taking into consideration the ages of the children, I fail to see how 25 days of access will help perpetuate the parent child bond with the Father. Also it is clear that video and telephone access will not be sufficient and effective given the ages of the children. The difficulties with such video and telephone access in these past months has led me to conclude that these will not be meaningful.

## Balancing of factors and conclusion on relocation

42     Taking into consideration all of the above factors and after embarking on a balancing exercise, I was of the view that it would not be in the best interests of the children if the Mother’s relocation application were to be allowed. If the children remain in Singapore, they will have the benefit of being able to nurture strong bonds with both parents. This is particularly important given the tender ages of the children. In contrast, if relocation were to be allowed, in effect, a death knell will be sounded on the relationship between the children and the Father. The comments made by Debbie Ong J in UFZ v _UFY_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHCF 8</span> _at \[18\]_, are particularly apt in this situation:

> “… On the one hand, where the relocation application is granted, the left- behind parent will lose previous access time with the beloved child. On the other hand, where the relocation application is denied, the parent with care and control may be tied, against his or her wishes, to an environment towards which he or she has little affinity and still be required to do his or her best in caring for the child, as well as finding employment, Globalization is a phenomenon which puts many families between a rock and a hard place. The court will do right by focusing on the child and decided what is best in his or her welfare. The outcomes reached often require the parents to make personal sacrifices for their children.”

43     I accordingly dismissed the Mother’s application for relocation.

## Access to the Father

44     Having dismissed the Mother’s application for relocation, I made access orders granting the Father liberal and regular access to the 2 children providing to him weekly access on Friday afternoons as well as weekly overnight access. In additional, I provided in my access orders for the Father to have access with the children for half of all school holidays as well as on alternate public holidays.

## Conclusion

45     For the abovementioned reasons, I dismissed the Mother’s relocation application, granted sole care and control to the Mother and liberal and regular access to the Father. This arrangement would in my view provide the requisite balance which will allow the children to continue to bond with each parent.
