Guardianship of Infants Act – Variation of Orders – Custody Care Control and Access – Child Maintenance

18 March 2021

### District Judge Goh Zhuo Neng:

## A.   INTRODUCTION

1       This grounds of decision concerns cross applications by the Mother and Father in respect of orders made for the maintenance, custody and access to the two children of their marriage who were aged 4 and 5 as of the date of the hearing (“**Children**”):

> a)     SUM 1829 of 2020 (“**Father’s Application**”) – To rescind orders made for the maintenance of the Children at **Annex A**. (“**Maintenance Orders**”).

> b)     SUM 2535 of 2020 (“**Mother’s Application**”) – To vary orders made for the custody and access to the Children at **Annex B**. (“**Child Orders**”) to provide that :

>> i)       The Father is to have supervised access to the Children at the Divorce Support Specialist Agency (“**DSSA**”) without overnight access.

>> ii)       That the Mother shall have sole custody of the Children, and in the alternative, the Mother shall have the final decision making on issues pertaining to the Children’s education, religion and all medical matters.

2       After hearing parties, I made the following orders.

> a)     Child Orders to be varied such that:

>> i)       The Mother will have sole authority to determine which schools the Children will attend, if she consults the Father and does not receive any reply within 3 days. For avoidance of doubt, the Children will continue to attend their current schools.

>> ii)       On 20 December 2020, 27 December 2020, 3 January 2021, and 10 January 2021, the Father shall have supervised access to the Children on Sunday 2.30pm to 5pm. Access will be supervised by the Mother or a person appointed by the Mother.

>> iii)       From the week of 11 January 2021, the Father shall have unsupervised access to the Children from 5.30pm to 8.00pm on Fridays and 10am to 5pm on Saturdays.

>> iv)       From the week of 1 February 2021, the Father shall have unsupervised alternate overnight access to the Children on 5.30pm Friday to 5.30pm Sunday.

>> v)       Father will notify the Mother within 1 week where he is residing in Singapore. Any changes to this residence must be notified to the Mother immediately.

> b)     Maintenance Orders to be varied such that:

>> i)       With effect from 1 January 2019, the maintenance payable by the Father for the Children shall be $2,968.00 ($1,484.00 per child).

>> ii)       With effect from 1 October 2020, the maintenance payable by the Father for the Children shall be $5,181.00 ($2,590.50 per child).

> c)     No orders as to costs.

3       For avoidance of doubt, I make it clear that the following aspects of the Child Orders and Maintenance Orders remain the same:

> a)     The parties shall have joint custody of the Children.

> b)     The Mother shall have care and control of the Children.

> c)     If the Children have any activities just before or after the Father’s access, the Father shall pick the Children up from or send them to the activity venue. Otherwise, the default handover venue shall be at McDonalds at \*xxx.

> d)     The Father is not permitted to take the Children out of Singapore without the written consent of the Mother.

> e)     The Mother shall hold all of the Children’s passports and travel documents (both Singaporean and Swedish passports and travel documents), which are to be placed in the Mother’s care by 14 September 2018. The Mother shall have the sole authority to apply for all of the Children’s passports and travel documents both in Singapore and Sweden. The Father shall not apply for any passport or travel documents for the Children without the consent of the Mother.

> f)     The Father is to pay the Mother arrears of maintenance for the period from February 2018 to September 2018 amounting to $17,000.00. The Father shall pay such arrears by instalments of $500.00 per month starting from 1 October 2020 and each first day of the month thereafter.

> g)     From 1 October 2018 to December 2018, the maintenance payable by the Father for the Children shall be $3,750.00 ($1,875.00 per child).

> h)     The maintenance for the Children shall be paid on the first day of each month into a bank account designated by the Mother (currently DBS Account No. xxx).

4       On 21 December 2020, the Father filed a Notice of Appeal against my decision. On 28 December 2020, the Mother filed a Notice of Appeal against my decision for the Father to resume access to the Children. I set out below the full grounds of my decision.

## B. BACKGROUND

### I.   OSG168 and 183 of 2017/Divorce Ordered by Swedish Court

5       On 12 September 2018, I heard the applications in OSG168 and OSG183 of 2017. At this juncture, parties had also pending divorce proceedings and a summons for spousal maintenance (SUMxxx of 2018) in Dxxx of 2017.

6       Parties informed me that on 7 September 2018, part judgement of divorce had been granted in Case No. xxx-18 by the District Court of Stockholm, Sweden (“**Swedish Court**”). Parties sought leave to discontinue Dxxx of 2017 and SUMxxx of 2018. Leave was granted and I proceeded to make orders in OSG168 and 183 of 2017.

7       Both parties appealed against my decision. The Father and Mother filed their respective appeals on 25 and 26 September 2018. My grounds of decision are set out in _URM v URN_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGFC 119</span>.

8       In its decision granting the divorce in Case No. xxx-18 on 7 September 2018, the Swedish Court found that the outstanding ancillary matters were _“custody, residence and visitation regarding the common children as well as maintenance to spouse”._ The Swedish Court subsequently made the following orders in Case No. xxx-18:

> a)     14 January 2019 – Dismissed the Father’s claim for custody of the Children and that they reside with him was rejected.

> b)     23 November 2019 – Ordered the Mother to pay maintenance to the Father.

> c)     23 April 2020 – Orders for the distribution of the matrimonial property (through an Estate Distribution attorney appointed by the Swedish Court on 7 September 2018)

### I.   Commencement of Variation and Committal Proceedings

9       On 30 January 2019, parties filed the following applications:

> a)     The Mother filed SUM229 of 2019, seeking an Access Evaluation Report for the purposes of evaluating the Father’s access arrangement with the Children and for access to be supervised at a DSSA pending resolution of her application. This application was withdrawn on 4 April 2019.

> b)     The Father filed SUM400 of 2019, seeking an order that the Mother be committed to prison or fined for withholding access to the Children from 8 December 2018. Leave had been granted for him to file this application on 28 January 2019 by SUM309 of 2019 (filed on 23 January 2019).

### II.   Result of Appeal Against OSG 168 and 183 of 2017

10     On 18 March 2019, the High Court affirmed my decision in OSG 168 and 183 of 2017, save that an adjustment was made giving the Father incremental access to the Children:

### IV.   Determination of Committal Proceedings

11     On 7 May 2019, I heard both SUM400 of 2019. In SUM400 of 2019, I found that the Mother had acted in contempt of my orders made on 12 September 2018 and ordered that she pay a fine of $2,000.00.

### III.   Father Leaves Singapore and Ceases Contact with Mother

12     On 9 May 2019, the Father through his lawyers informed the Mother that he was _“totally mentally burnout and out of all financial means”_, and that he would from June _“retreat and put (his) focus on getting back on (his) feet.”_ He asked her if he could let the Children stay with him from 17 to 26 May 2019, given that after that he _“might not see the children until they are much older.”_ He also mentioned that he was “likely to not be able to make too much payment” for 6 to 9 months as he worked on getting out of _“his burned out state and regain(ed) financial ability”._

13     On 5 June 2019, the Father did not show up for access. He would not contact the Mother directly on access issues until 12 April 2020.

### VI.   Commencement of Swedish Child Maintenance Proceedings

14     On 20 June 2019, the Father filed an application in the Swedish Court for child maintenance payable by him to be fixed at $1,224.00 or an amount the Court found reasonable and proper, or that he had no legal responsibility for paying maintenance for the Children. This application (filed in xxx-20) was not filed in the same case docket as the Swedish divorce (filed in xxx-18). On 10 January 2020, the Swedish Court decided that the Father’s application for child maintenance would be heard in separate proceedings from the Swedish divorce, and on 16 January 2020 held that it had jurisdiction to hear the child maintenance application.

### VII.   Father Resumes Contact with Mother

15     On 12 April 2020, the Father contacted the Mother to re-establish a dialogue with her in respect of the Children, and following that, sought to have access to the Children. The Mother asked for the Father’s proposal for access as he had been absent from their lives for more than a year. Parties were unable to reach an agreement, and the Father was unable to have access to the Children as of the date of the hearing.

### VIII.   Swedish Child Maintenance Order Made

16     On 26 May 2020, the Swedish Court heard the Father’s application for child maintenance. It ordered that the Father would pay $1,224.00 in child maintenance to the Mother (“**Swedish CM Order**”). This was a judgement made in default of the Mother’s appearance, but with reference to Singapore law, and with knowledge of the Maintenance Orders made in Singapore.

### IX.   Commencement of the Current Applications by Both Parents

17     On 7 July 2020, the Father filed his application to set aside the Maintenance Orders, citing the making of the Swedish CM Order, which he characterised as a _“final maintenance order”._ He also claimed that he had _“no work ability”_ from December 2018 to 2020. He blamed this condition on the Mother’s depriving him of access in December 2018 and onwards. A memo dated 23 May 2019 from his psychiatrist, Dr \[M\], stated that the Father was _“diagnosed (him) with Major Depression secondary to his situation”_.

18     On 1 September 2020, the Mother filed her application to vary the Child Orders, claiming that the Father’s mental condition as stated in his application made him an unfit parent. She also made reference to his absence from the Children’s lives after June 2018.

## C.   THE FATHER’S APPLICATION

### I.    Is the Swedish CM Order a Final Maintenance Order?

19     The Father relied on the finding of the High Court in _AUA v ATZ_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 161</span> (“**AUA**”) for the proposition that orders made under the Guardianship of Infants Act (“**GIA**”) are interim in nature if made in contemplation of divorce proceedings.

20      _AUA_ was concerned with the scenario where orders for custody were made under the GIA, and subsequently a Court has to exercise its powers under s124 of the Women’s Charter (“**WC**”) to make orders in relation to custody in the ancillary proceedings. The High Court observed that:

> a)     Analysing s124 of the WC, once the parties are in the matrimonial jurisdiction of the Court, the Court is entitled to make any order or vary any previous order in relation to the custody care and control and access of the child. The discretion of the court hearing the ancillary matters is not fettered by any previous order made under s5 of the GIA \[98\].

> b)     A GIA order made in contemplation of a divorce can only have an interim effect as it does not take into account the fact that the parties would eventually be parting ways and does not allow a court to assess holistically the interaction between maintenance, the status of the matrimonial assets and the custody, care and control and access of a child \[99\].

21     I took the view that the Swedish Court did not consider the making of the Swedish CM Order an exercise of its matrimonial jurisdiction.

> a)     In ordering the divorce on September 2018, the Swedish Court observed that issues of spousal maintenance, child custody and division of property remained to be resolved. There was no reference to child maintenance.

> b)     All the remaining ancillary issues referred to by the Swedish Court on September 2018 were subsequently dealt with under the same case docket (xxx-18). This was distinct from the child maintenance proceedings subsequently commenced by the Father on 20 June 2019 (xxx-20).

> c)     On 10 January 2020, the Swedish Court decided that the Father’s application for child maintenance would be heard in separate proceedings from the Swedish divorce.

> d)     On 16 January 2020, the Swedish Court held that it had jurisdiction to hear the child maintenance application. It is notable that the Swedish Court only took jurisdiction on the basis that the Father and the Children were Swedish citizens under Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No.4 of 18 December 2008 (“**Maintenance Regulation**”). In addressing Article 3 of the Maintenance Regulation where jurisdiction can arise when the court has jurisdiction to hear an action concerning a person’s legal status or parental responsibility (e.g. the Swedish divorce proceedings), if the question of maintenance is related to that legal action: _“__the petitions for child maintenance were not related to the case concerning marriage_ _due to that (the Father) did not submit these petitions until the case was only concerned with (the Mother’s) petition and claims for spousal maintenance. Therefore the (Swedish Court) does not have jurisdiction to examine the petitions for child maintenance in accordance with Article 3 of the Maintenance Regulation”._

22     The Father explained that he did not put in a claim for child maintenance when filing the divorce as this was consistent with the practice in Sweden to have the issues of custody determined first before applying for child maintenance to be determined. He produced no evidence of such a practice, whether by conduct or by law. I was not convinced.

23     Accordingly, I took the view that _AUA_ did not apply in the present case. While this meant that there would be competing child maintenance orders in Singapore and Sweden, this was induced by the Father’s conduct. The child maintenance application in Sweden was unconnected with the Swedish divorce proceedings and an attempt to circumvent the Maintenance Orders.

### II.    Was the Father’s Earning Capacity Affected?

24     The Father claimed that he had no work ability from December 2018 to December 2020, and had only regained his earning capacity. In support of this claim, he submitted the following tax assessments:

> a)     Singapore – Notices for Year of Assessment 2018, 2019, 2020.

> b)     Sweden – Notices for Years of Assessment 2018, 2019.

> c)     Australia – Notices for years ended 30 June 2019, 30 June 2020.

25     All the tax assessments reported a zero income, save for the Singapore tax assessment for the Year of Assessment 2018 (which refers to 2017 income) where the Father reported an income of $30,000.00.

26     On the face of these documents, it appeared that the Father had not earned a cent since January 2018. However, this contradicts submissions made at the hearing of OSG168 and 183 of 2017 on 12 September 2018, where he submitted that as of 2 February 2018, he had entered into an employment agreement with an Australian company paying him AUD 10,000.00 a month. In explaining how his monthly take home income was reduced by AUD 3,949.00 in taxes, he even went as far as to quantify the income tax he would have to pay to the Swedish, Singaporean and Australian tax authorities. See paragraphs 8 and 9 of the Father’s affidavit dated 12 February 2018.

27     The Father’s credibility and his assertions that he was unable to continue making the payments under the Child Maintenance Order were further undermined by his lack of disclosure. He did not indicate what his current monthly income was or what his current monthly expenses were. He did not provide any bank statements or credit card statements. His financial affairs were shrouded in mystery.

### III.    Were There Any Facts Justifying a Variation?

28     Section 3 read with Section 5 of the GIA provides that orders made under the GIA may be varied by the Court. In these applications, the welfare of the Child is to be the first and paramount consideration. While the GIA does not provide specific criteria justifying a variation, there should not be a significant difference between applications to vary maintenance made under the GIA, and under section 72(1) of the WC, which uses the test of a change of circumstances of the respective parties or the child.

29     In considering the matter, I realised that the Mother’s income had increased significantly over the years. At the time the Maintenance Orders were made in 12 September 2018, I held that the Mother would have a gross earning capacity of $2,400.00 a month, versus the Father’s gross earning capacity of $10,000.00 which would increase to $20,000.00 in October 2020. I reproduce my calculations in a table below.

30     However, the Mother’s Notice of Assessment for the Year of Assessment 2020 indicated she had a gross annual income of $68,180.00 for the year 2019. This was more than twice her gross annual income of $28,800.00 that I had assessed in 2018. I assessed her income capacity to be $68,000.00 (rounded down) from January 2019 onwards. This meant that as of January 2019, the amount of child maintenance payable by the Father would be reduced. My calculations are set out below.

31     This meant that:

> a)     With effect from 1 January 2019, the maintenance payable by the Father for the Children shall be $2,968.00 ($1,484.00 per child).

> b)     With effect from 1 October 2020, the maintenance payable by the Father for the Children shall be $5,181.00 ($2,590.50 per child).

32     In the meanwhile, the following Maintenance Orders made by me would still prevail.

> a)     The Father is to pay the Mother arrears of maintenance for the period from February 2018 to September 2018 amounting to $17,000.00. The Father shall pay such arrears by instalments of $500.00 per month starting from 1 October 2020 and each first day of the month thereafter.

> b)     From 1 October 2018 to December 2018, the maintenance payable by the Father for the Children shall be $3,750.00 ($1,875.00 per child).

33     An argument was raised in the Father’s submissions that the Mother was “gainfully employed” by August 2018. This fact was allegedly withheld at the hearing of OSG 168 and 183 of 2017 on 12 September 2018. This was a mere submission without sufficient evidence on what the Mother was earning as at August 2018. The Mother’s Notice of Assessment for the Year of Assessment 2019 (which refers to 2018 income) was not obtainable as she had earned less than the gazetted threshold for the filing of an income tax return ($22,000.00). Therefore it is unclear what impact her gainful employment would have had on my decision on 12 September 2018.

## D.   THE MOTHER’S APPLICATION

### I.    Does a First Instance Court have the Power to Vary an order made by an Appellate Court on Appeal?

34     The Father’s counsel submitted that the Family Justice Courts did not have the jurisdiction to hear the Mother’s Application as this concerned the variation of an order made by an appellate court (Family Division of the High Court).

35     I found no merit in the argument. There was also nothing explicit in the Family Justice Rules or the Family Justice Act cited by the Father’s counsel which would have prevented me from hearing the Mother’s Application. Therefore I proceeded to determine the Mother’s Application.

### II.    Should the Mother be Given Sole Custody of the Children?

36     In applications to vary orders made under the GIA, the welfare of the Child is to be the first and paramount consideration. While section 5 of the GIA is silent as regards the requirements, there is no reason why the test under s128 of the WC as set out below should not apply:

> _“The court may at any time vary or rescind any order for the custody, or the care and control, of a child on the application of any interested person, where it is satisfied that the order was based on any misrepresentation of fact or mistake of fact or where there has been any material change in the circumstances.”_

37     As mentioned in _UHB v UHA_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGFC 125</span>, \[39\]:

> _“…Fundamentally, the subject matters are the same - both are concerned with variation of custody, care and control and access orders relating to children. In principle, whether an application is taken out under s 5 of the GIA or s 128 of the WC, there should not be any significant difference in approach. This is especially so given the fact that the GIA and WC speak with one voice, which is that the paramount consideration is the welfare of the child (see s 3 of the GIA and s 125 of the WC).”_

38     In _CX v CY_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGCA 37</span>, it was held that sole custody orders would only be justified in exceptional circumstances. For example, where one parent had physically, sexually or emotionally abused the child or the relationship of the parents was such that cooperation was impossible and the lack of co-operation was harmful to the Child.

39     The Mother relied largely on the Father’s departure from Singapore and the 23 May 2019 Memo from Dr \[M\] (“**May 2019 Memo**”) to paint the Father as being an unreliable parent whose mental condition was in doubt.

40     While the May 2019 Memo indicated that that Father had been diagnosed with Major Depression secondary to his situation, this was historical. Subsequently he was examined by Dr \[M\] again on 7 August and 24 September 2020 and _“did not present with any symptoms of depression, anxiety or suicidal ideation and there was no need for any medications.”_ I did not find sufficient evidence that he would harm the Children or that they would be unsafe in his care. Therefore I dismissed the Mother’s application to have sole custody of the Children.

### III.    Should the Mother have the Final Decision Making on Education, Religion and all Medical Matters?

41     The Mother explained that the Father had obstructed the Children’s enrolment in pre-school. He had instructed his lawyers to write to a pre-school on 23 November 2018, informing them that he had not agreed for the Children to be placed on its waiting list. This resulted in the Children being taken off the waiting list.

42     I found that the Father was not being deliberately obstructive in his choice of school for the Children. In the case of the preschool, he was simply asserting his right as a parent with joint custody to decide which pre-school the Children should attend. I would add that in 10 April 2019, he had contacted the Mother on the issue of enrolment of the Children in pre-school, asking for further relevant information such as where the Children were residing in Singapore so that he could get back to the Mother with suggestions of his own. The Mother did not reply to him on this point.

43     There was a remaining concern that the Father might suddenly disappear from the Children’s lives. This should not be a bar to the Children being enrolled in school. Therefore I ordered that the Mother would have sole authority to determine which schools the Children will attend, if she consults the Father and does not receive any reply within 3 days. For avoidance of doubt, the Children will continue to attend their current schools.

44     On the other issues such as religion and medical matters, the Mother did not provide sufficient evidence of how the Father had been obstructive, or how his absence had made it difficult for decisions to be made on these issues. Therefore I made no further orders addressing the Mother’s authority to decide on these issues.

### IV.    What Sort Of Access Should The Father Have?

45     The Mother proposed that the Father have supervised access. This was on the basis that he had been absent from the Children’s lives for some time. The Father wanted his access to resume pursuant to the Child Orders.

46     Parties also delved into facts and allegations that had been raised in OSG168 and 183 of 2017. I did not address them. There was no point in raking up these old disputes. It was more productive to examine what had happened since the Child Orders were made on 18 March 2019.

47     It is not disputed that the Father had been absent from the Children’s lives for some time from 5 June 2019, and he had only returned to Singapore on 2 July 2020. Due to his Stay Home Notice, he was only able to meet the Children from 16 July 2020. The Mother had proposed that access resume on a supervised basis first given his long absence, before parties could work out access on an unsupervised basis. The Mother also asked the Father to disclose his place of residence. As the Father was not agreeable to this, he was not able to have access to the Children.

48     I took the view that it would be in the best interests of the Children if they could resume their interactions with their Father. However, given his long absence, his reintegration into their lives should proceed on an incremental basis and with a familiar caregiver first. I ordered that the Child Orders would be varied such that the Father would have access:

> a)     On 20 December 2020, 27 December 2020, 3 January 2021, and 10 January 2021, the Father shall have supervised access to the Children on Sunday 2.30pm to 5pm. Access will be supervised by the Mother or a person appointed by the Mother.

> b)     From the week of 11 January 2021, the Father shall have unsupervised access to the Children from 5.30pm to 8.00pm on Fridays and 10am to 5pm on Saturdays.

> c)     From the week of 1 February 2021, the Father shall have unsupervised alternate overnight access to the Children on 5.30pm Friday to 5.30pm Sunday.

49     I also required the Father to notify the Mother within 1 week where he is residing in Singapore. Any changes to this residence must be notified to the Mother immediately. This would give the Mother the assurance she needed as to where the Children would be staying with the Father in Singapore.

## E.   CONCLUSION AND COSTS

50     For the reasons set out above, I made the above orders. The Mother’s counsel submitted that the Father should bear legal costs. The Father asked that no costs be ordered against him as part of his prayers had been granted. I agreed with him and ordered each party to bear their own costs.
