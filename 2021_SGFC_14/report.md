Ancillary Matters – Care and Control – Access

19 February 2021

### District Judge Goh Zhuo Neng:

## A.   INTRODUCTION

1       The Plaintiff Father (“**Father**”) and Defendant Mother (“**Mother**”) were married on 30 July 2016. The Father is a Swedish national and the Mother is a Taiwanese national. They have a child born in 2017 (“**Child**”). On 31 July 2019, the Father commenced divorce proceedings. On 19 December 2019, interim judgement was granted.

2       This hearing concerned the determination of the following ancillary matters:

> a)     Who should have care and control of the Child.

> b)     What terms of access should be granted to the Child.

> c)     What terms should be ordered for the maintenance of the Child.

3       The other ancillary matters had been resolved by agreement, as parties had agreed that they would have joint custody of the Child. The Mother agreed that she would not seek maintenance from the Father, and parties had consented to retain all assets held in their own names.

4       On 28 July 2020, I heard the submissions of counsel for both parties and made the following orders.

> a)     That the Mother shall have care and control of the Child.

> b)     The Father will have access to the Child as follows:

>> i)       Monday and Wednesday from 6.00pm to 8.30pm.

>> ii)       Weekend access on Saturday 9.30am to 6.30pm. From the week of 1 September onwards, this will change to alternating Weekend Access:

>>> a.       Saturday 9.30am to 6.30pm (5 September 2020 and fortnightly)

>>> b.       Saturday 9.30am to Sunday 9.30am (11 September 2020 and fortnightly)

>> iii)       With the exception of the public holidays in (iv) and (v), alternate Public Holiday Access from 9.30am to 6.30pm on the date of the public holiday, with the Father taking the next public holiday after Hari Raya Haji.

>> iv)       The Father will have Chinese New Year Access on the 2nd day from 9.30am to 9.30pm. For avoidance of doubt, the Mother will have the Child on Chinese New Year Eve and the whole of the 1st day of Chinese New Year.

>> v)       Christmas access (starting in 2020 on an alternating basis):

>>> a.       Christmas Eve 9.30am to Christmas Day 9.30am – Father (even years), Mother (odd years)

>>> b.       Christmas Day 9.30am to Boxing Day 9.30am – Mother (even years), Father (odd years).

>> vi)       Before the Child begins primary school, the Father will have year-end access to the Child for 1 week in the first week of December, starting from 1 December 2020.

>> vii)       Once the Child begins primary school, the parents will alternate half of the mid-year and end-year school holidays. The Father will have the first half of both holidays the first year the Child is in primary school. This will take priority over all other access.

> c)     Both parties will be permitted to take the child on overseas trips during their access once the Child reaches 4 years old. When taking the Child overseas, each party will give written notice to the other parent on the destination, duration, flight details, phone contact details. 48 hours notice is required if the child is travelling in South East Asia. If the child is travelling beyond South East Asia, then 1 week’s notice must be given. Mother will hold on to the passport and travel documents of the child, and hand them over to the Father when presenting the child for overseas access. The Father will return these documents with the child when returning the child from overseas access.

> d)     The Child’s residence will be the pick up and return point for the Father’s access.

> e)     The Father will pay the Mother $1,650.00 a month for the maintenance of the Child. This will be made on the 1st day of the month with effect from 1 August 2020.

> f)     No order as to costs.

5       There was a further clarification on 20 August 2020, where I confirmed my orders in relation to the overseas access permitted to both parents (“**Clarification**”). For avoidance of doubt, I did not amend or vary any of my orders made on 28 July 2020.

6       On 20 November 2020, the Mother filed a Notice of Appeal against my decision, having obtained leave of court to do so out of time. I set out below the full grounds of my decision.

## B.   ISSUES OF CUSTODY

I.      _Mother’s Request for Final Say on Education and Healthcare Issues_

7       While parties were agreed on joint custody, the Mother argued that she should be given the final say to make decisions in relation to the Child’s education and healthcare in the event there was no written agreement after discussion and consultation with the Father.

8       In support of her prayers, she cited the case of _ET v ES_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] SGHC 152</span> (“**ET**”), where the High Court held at \[8\] and \[9\] that the mother would have sole decision-making power in respect of the day to day care of the children and all matters affecting the welfare and interests of the children, save for the following matters (“**Prescribed Matters**”):

> (i)     Choice of religion;

> (ii)     Choice of school and tertiary institution;

> (iii)     Treatments in respect of major and critical illnesses (other than emergencies); and

> (iv)     Elective surgery including dental braces.

The High Court also held that if parties were not able to reach a joint decision on the Prescribed Matters, the mother’s decision shall prevail until such time as the father could obtain an order of court.

9       The High Court’s reasons for doing so were to minimise the sources of potential conflict so that the parties could devote their energies more productively to the welfare of the children. The High Court was of the view that the circumstances in that case were ripe for continuing conflict as the father was still living with his new partner (the mother’s former best friend). His relationship with this partner was cited as the cause of the breakdown of the marriage. To avoid prejudice to the children and to avoid _“no end of applications to court”_ in the event that parties could not agree on a particular matter, the mother (who lived with the children) should be allowed the final say.

10     Here, the Mother cited examples of how she had disagreed with the Father on several matters and how he had not made decisions in the best interest of the Child. My analysis of these issues are set out below.

II.     _BCG Vaccine_

11     The Mother alleged that in March 2017, the Father had become angry with the Mother when she filled in a form for the Child to be vaccinated with the BCG vaccine without asking him. He did not provide valid grounds for objecting and to date, has refused to allow the Child to be vaccinated to “_punish_” the Mother for not getting his agreement.

12     The Father explained that while he was upset with the Mother for not consulting him before filling in the vaccination form, this was because he felt that he should have been consulted as a parent. He was not objecting to the Child being vaccinated if required, but not simply by default if it was optional. Text messages dated 3 to 4 December 2018 exhibited by the Father after a call with the National Immunisation Registry (“**NIR**”) confirmed this.

> (emphasis in bold and italics added)

13     From the above documentary evidence, both parties had agreed not to administer the BCG vaccine to the Child for the time being. They were able to reach a common landing that if the BCG vaccine was a compulsory requirement for admission to school, then they would send the Child for it.

##### III. _Day to Day Healthcare Issues_

14     The Mother claimed that the Father was averse to medical advice and would insist on his own medical philosophy. Here, the Mother referred to the disagreement between parties on medical issues.

> a)     Eczema - 1 July 2017 – The parties had a disagreement over whether coconut oil (Father’s position) or the doctor prescribed moisturiser (Mother’s position) should be applied to the Child’s face to soothe his eczema. Only after the Child’s eczema worsened to the point that it “_looked like it was rotting_” did the Father agree to use the prescribed moisturiser.

> b)     Paracetamol - July 2017 – The Father refused to administer paracetamol to the Child unless his temperature exceeded 38.5 degrees.

> c)     Breastmilk - Shortly after the Child was born in 2017 – The doctor recommended that the Mother’s breastmilk be supplemented with formula milk. The Father disagreed with this, claiming he would rather buy breastmilk online, which resulted in the Mother having to increase her breastfeeding routine.

> d)     Cough Medicine - December 2017 to January 2018 – The Father did not give the Child medication that was prescribed for a cough that arose from a respiratory infection.

> e)     Disparaging Doctors - Undated occasion – The Father had disparaged a doctor by commenting _“What does he know, he’s just a doctor from Alabama”_.

15     The Father admitted that he had his own views about medication, but he was open to listening to other views, including professional views, and would put the Child’s interests first. As with the allegations on the BCG vaccine, the Father was able to provide documentary evidence which showed that:

> a)     Eczema – Messages from July 2017 show that parties were in discussions to use different types of moisturiser. In that discussion, the Father mentioned that they should check with a doctor, and that he had also spoken with hotlines. The Father also denied that the Child’s eczema worsened to the extent alleged by the Mother.

> b)     Paracetamol – The Father denied that he refused to administer paracetamol, and provided messages in May 2018. In these messages, the Father proposes that “If he (Child) still has fever tonight we can consider some paracetamol”. When the Child’s temperature passed 38.7 degrees, the Father suggested that they give the Child paracetamol.

> c)     Breastmilk – The Father exhibited messages from April 2017 showing that he was fine giving the Child formula milk “Otherwise just feed him whatever cow/goat milk powder we have?” and sent a picture of a tin of milk powder to the Mother. While the Father did propose the possibility of buying breastmilk online, this was not strenuously pursued.

> d)     Cough Medicine – The Father stated that both parties jointly agreed not to medicate the Child in order to let him recover naturally. He pointed out as in all cases, this was done up to a point and there was no intention to jeopardise the Child’s health.

> e)     Disparaging Doctors – The Father denied making a disparaging statement about the doctor as alleged by the Mother. He explained that the Mother was making reference to a Dr H, and was able to provide text messages where he affirmed the competence of Dr H.

16     In summary, I felt that the Mother had exaggerated the extent of the disagreement on these issues. As in the case of the BCG Vaccine, her allegations that the Father was being deliberately difficult were bare statements and were not supported by documentary evidence. A review of the text messages provided by the Father suggested a more consultative tone to the dialogue where the Father was only guilty of having different views from the Mother.

##### IV.    _Choice of Preschool_

17     The Mother also brought up the disagreement that the parties had over the choice of pre-school. This had occurred in late 2019, after the divorce proceedings had commenced. The Father had objected to the Mother’s choice of preschool as it was too costly, and the Mother filed an application in SUMxxx of 2019 for an order that she be allowed to decide on the Child’s preschool.

18     Eventually, parties reached an agreement in mediation which was reflected in a consent order (see below at paragraph 26.) Under this agreement, the Mother’s choice prevailed, and the Father was only required to pay $600.00 in contribution to these expenses.

19     The Father pointed out that there were other preschools that were considered, and he was of the view that they were better value and more affordable. As I will be addressing my views on pre-school expenses in respect of child maintenance, it was more relevant for me to focus more on whether the difference of views on this issue justified the Mother being given sole authority to decide issues of education and healthcare.

20     I was of the view that it did not. While it was unfortunate that an application to court was required to determine the issue of the Child’s preschool, the cause of the Father’s disagreement was really one of affordability and not borne of an intent to cause conflict. Moreover, the parties were still able to reach a settlement in mediation.

##### V.    _Summary_

21     I took the view that the Mother had not shown that the circumstances in this case were ripe for continuing conflict, as it was in the case of _ET._ The documentary evidence provided by the Father suggested there was insufficient basis to suggest that the parties were unable to amicably resolve their different views on medical and educational issues.

22     In respect of the BCG Vaccine, the Father had made it clear that he was fine to go ahead with the vaccine if it was compulsory to have it. In respect of the Day to Day Medical Issues, the Mother was unable to support her bare allegations that the Father wilfully disregarded medical advice in a toxic manner. The Father’s messages showed that parties considered their options amicably, including those suggested by a doctor. On the issue of the preschool, the Father eventually agreed with the Mother’s choice, and there was insufficient evidence to suggest that the Father’s reasons for disagreeing with the Mother were borne out of vindictiveness.

23     The point to be made here is that parties are always going to have different views. That does not necessarily mean that it will escalate into conflict that paralyses decision making, which was the concern in ET. Moreover, the present case was also distinguishable from _ET_, where the cause of the matrimonial breakdown (the Father’s partner in _ET_) remained in parties’ lives. Therefore, I did not grant the Mother authority to make final decisions over the medical and educational issues of the Child.

## C.   CARE AND CONTROL AND ACCESS

24     As I had awarded care and control as prayed for by the Mother, I will focus on issues of access that were considered by me.

I.      _Overview of Access to Date and Roles of Caregivers_

25     Both parties confirmed at the hearing that:

> a)     Both parties did not work on weekends and ended work at about 6-7pm on weekdays.

> b)     The maternal grandmother played a significant role in the caregiving of the Child. Prior to the Father moving out in May 2019, she lived separately from parties and would go to the matrimonial home and take care of the Child while parties were at work. From June 2019, she moved into the matrimonial home.

> c)     Since May 2019, the Child has been living with the Mother since the Father moved out in May 2019.

> d)     From 7 May 2019 to 30 September 2019, the Father would have access to the Child for 4 hours a week. This access was exercised from 9.30am to 1.30pm on Saturdays.

26     On 15 November 2019, the parties had entered into a consent order (“**Consent Order**”) where:

> a)     The Father would have access to the Child on Mondays and Wednesdays from 6.00pm to 8.30pm, and Saturdays from 9.30am to 1.30pm.

> b)     The Father would pay the Mother $810.00 a month as maintenance for the Child (being $600.00 for the Child’s preschool fees and $210.00 for the Childs expenses), on the 1st day of the month with effect from 1 December 2019. This was without prejudice to the parties’ positions on Child maintenance at the ancillary hearing.

> c)     The Mother would be at liberty to enrol the Child in the current preschool.

> d)     The Child would not be brought out of Singapore while the divorce proceedings are still in progress.

##### II.    _Parties’ Positions_

27     The Mother took the position that the terms of access made in the Consent Order should remain the same. There would be no overnight access, and no overseas access for the Father. The Father was seeking shared care and control of the Child. The thrust of the Mother’s position was that she should be regarded as the primary caregiver of the Child and that the Father was a largely absent and negligent parent. The Father disagreed and claimed that their parenting roles were equal once the parties had returned to work.

##### III.    _Overnight Access_

28     Here, the Mother submitted the cases of **_AQL v AQM_** <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGHC 264</span> (“**AQL**”), and **_FP v FQ_** <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGDC 223</span> (“**FP**”) for the proposition that overnight access is not granted when children are young, and there are doubts about the Father’s ability to facilitate overnight access. In both cases, the child was 3 years old, as in the present case. I observed that:

> a)     In _AQL_ at \[23\],\[24\], the Court found that the main reason why the father wanted to have the child for overnight access was not so that he could spend more time with her, but so that he could take her for more enrichment classes. There was a concern that the child would be overburdened by enrichment classes if overnight access was granted. The child had always spent the night with her mother and it might be traumatic to let her spend a night alone with her father.

> b)     In _FP_ at \[5\], the Court was concerned that the father would not be able to care for the child by himself, and would rely wholly or to a very large extent on the paternal grandmother to look after the child.

> c)     In both cases, the Father had not explained why an order for overnight access would be in the child’s interest. _FP_ at \[5\], _AQL_ at \[23\].

29     The Mother claimed that similarly, the Father should not have overnight access or overseas access as:

> a)     The Father would not be able to care for the Child, who was diagnosed with G6PD deficiency, eczema and allergies, which make caregiving challenging. The Father was also unfamiliar with the Child’s routine and had never cared for the Child during the marriage. Examples were given of the Father asking the Mother in September to December 2019 for recipes and information on what he should feed the Child, and allegations of how the Child may not have been properly hydrated during access. The Father also did not have a helper at home, unlike the maternal grandmother who lived with the Mother.

> b)     The Father had been sleeping in a separate room from the Child since 2017. On the other hand, the Child had always been sleeping in the same room as the Mother (who slept on a separate crib) since he was born, and in the same bed since early 2018.

> c)     The Father had not explained why an order for overnight access would be in the Child’s interest.

30     I did not think that these reasons were sufficient for me to withhold overnight access from the Father. My reasons are set out below.

> a)     The existence of medical issues in a child meant there were more things for a caregiver to consider, but did not make caregiving impossible or difficult. The Mother did not elaborate in her evidence what were the “_many allergies_” of the Child as a result of his G6PD deficiency save for an allergy to fava beans or legumes.

> b)     The Child’s routines and care required simply needed to be communicated to the Father by the Mother. The Father had not attained the same level of familiarity as the Mother, but there was evidence that he was coming up to speed. An example of this was the Father’s desire to learn how to cook for his Child. I accept that he had not been responsible for cooking for the Child during the marriage, but since September 2019, he had begun contacting the Mother for recipes and more information on what to feed the Child.

> c)     The Father’s lack of a helper and family at home was not a strong factor in my consideration. If his access to the Child took place outside of his office hours, he would have enough time and attention for the Child. In fact, this distinguished the present case from _FP_, where the father was heavily reliant on his parents and family to take care of the Child. Furthermore, the Father also mentioned that he would employ a helper if needed.

> d)     While the Child had indeed been spending more time sleeping with the Mother and apart from the Father, this should not be held against the Father. The Father explained that while this was the case, this was not his choice. It was imposed on him by the Mother. This was supported by a text message enclosed at page 351 of the Mother’s 1st Affidavit of Means which had been admitted to prove the Father had been sleeping separately from the Child. It contained an outburst from the Father who clearly resented that he had been forced to do so.

> (emphasis in bold and italics added)

> e)     Far from being uninvolved in the care of the Child, the Father was able to provide messages between the parties to show that he had showered the Child, and put the Child to bed. These messages were circa 2018, and pre-date the commencement of the divorce proceedings.

> f)     The Father had also provided explanations in his evidence as to why he needed overnight access with the Child. I note that his affidavit was in support of a shared care and control arrangement, which clearly envisaged that he would have overnight access with the Child. He had explained that he had experience caring for the Child and putting the Child to sleep. A dedicated bedroom had also been set up at his residence for the Child. It would also be good for the Child to spend more time with him to get exposure to the cultures of both parents and I accepted that he had a strong bond with the Child which should continue to be nurtured.

31     From the above, it was clear to me that it would be in the best interests of the Child to have overnight access with the Father. While not as experienced with the Child’s needs as the Mother, the Father had been involved in the Child’s care from the Child’s birth and had shown the enthusiasm and ability to adapt.

32     The caselaw cited by the Mother could also be distinguished on the facts. I note that this was not a case where the Father was going to spend the bulk of access sending the Child to enrichment classes (_AQL_) or where the Father was going to delegate the care of the Child to his family (_ET_). The Father had made no such statements about enrichment classes, and he was clearly living alone in Singapore without family and would get a helper if required. The Father had also provided dedicated facilities for the Child to spend the night with him. Therefore, it was an opportune time to allow the Father to have overnight access.

33     This overnight access would be implemented gradually with effect from the week of 1 September 2020, and then on a fortnightly basis. Until then, the Father’s access would still be based on the current access, but he would have an additional 5 hours with the Child on the weekend, ending his access at 6.30pm.

> i)     Monday and Wednesday from 6.00pm to 8.30pm.

> ii)     Weekend access on Saturday 9.30am to 6.30pm. From the week of 1 September onwards, this will change to alternating Weekend Access:

>> a.       Saturday 9.30am to 6.30pm (5 September 2020 and fortnightly)

>> b.       Saturday 9.30am to Sunday 9.30am (11 September 2020 and fortnightly)

34     This would give the Father about 1 month to prepare the Child and familiarise the Child with his home. I appreciated the Child was still young, so I limited the overnight access to once a week on a fortnightly basis.

##### IV.    _Other Access Orders_

35     Aside from the regular access, I also addressed access during the public and school holidays as well as other occasions.

#### _Public Holiday Access_

36     In respect of holiday access, parties did not really have much specific evidence. The Mother had taken no position on such access as she simply wanted a continuation of the access under the Consent Order. The Father was seeking alternate public holiday access. The Father’s counsel submitted that as the Mother’s family celebrated Chinese New Year, the Father was happy to let her have it.

37     I provided that parties would alternate public holiday access, allowing the Father to take the next public holiday after Hari Raya Haji. As for Chinese New Year, the Child would remain with the Mother on the eve and the first day of Chinese New Year so that she could attend the reunion dinner and celebrate the holiday with the Mother. The Father would be allowed to have access on the 2nd day of Chinese New Year which was a holiday. Christmas access was to alternate with parties taking Christmas Eve and Day in alternate years. The terms of access are set out below.

> a)     With the exception of the public holidays in (b) and (c), alternate Public Holiday Access from 9.30am to 6.30pm on the date of the public holiday, with the Father taking the next public holiday after Hari Raya Haji.

> b)     The Father will have Chinese New Year Access on the 2nd day from 9.30am to 9.30pm. For avoidance of doubt, the Mother will have the Child on Chinese New Year Eve and the whole of the 1st day of Chinese New Year.

> c)     Christmas access (starting in 2020 on an alternating basis):

>> i)       Christmas Eve 9.30am to Christmas Day 9.30am – Father (even years), Mother (odd years).

>> ii)       Christmas Day 9.30am to Boxing Day 9.30am – Mother (even years), Father (odd years).

#### _School Holidays and Other Access_

38     On the issue of school holiday and other access, the Mother had no stated position. The Father was seeking half the Child’s mid and year end school holidays once the Child’s formal education began. This would occur in 2024 when the Child was enrolled in primary school. So that the school holiday access would not be interrupted, I also provided that it would take priority over all other access.

39     Having already ordered that the Child would have overnight access with the Father, I did not have any objections to granting the Father’s prayers. By the time the Child started formal education i.e. primary school, the Mother’s concerns about his age would be less of an issue. The Child would also be used to overnight access with the Father.

40     As the Child would need some time to get used to staying overnight for a extended period with the Father, I provided that from 1 December 2020, the Father would have year end access to the Child for 1 week in the first week of December. My orders on this are set out below.

> a)     Before the Child begins primary school, the Father will have year end access to the Child for 1 week in the first week of December, starting from 1 December 2020.

> b)     Once the Child begins primary school, the parents will alternate half of the mid-year and end-year school holidays. The Father will have the first half of both holidays the first year the Child is in primary school. This will take priority over all other access.

##### V.    Overseas Access

41     The Mother submitted that overseas access should not be granted at this stage and be deferred until the Child was older and able to communicate his own needs. She cited the case of _BEP v BEQ_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGDC 348</span> (“**_BEP_**”), where the Father’s application for overseas access was dismissed by the Court as both children were young (aged 6 and 8) and the younger child was allergic to dust mites and certain types of food. As the Child in the present case was younger (3 years) and also had allergies in addition to separation anxiety as he had never spent a day away from the Mother, _BEP_ should be followed. The Mother also repeated her concerns about the Father’s ability to take care of the Child, which I have already addressed.

42     The Father submitted that the Child had travelled overseas when he was very young (aged 1 in 2018), when they had visited his parents for a week. This was confirmed by the Mother, who also confirmed she had brought the Child over for work trips to Washington (where her family had taken care of the Child when she was at work) and to visit her family in Taiwan.

43     I was of the view that while the Child was young, the Child was not unfamiliar with overseas travel. This was distinguishable from _BEP_, where it was not stated whether the children in _BEP_ had ever travelled overseas. In _BEP_, the Father also wanted to take the children overseas for up to 2 weeks at a time during the June and December holidays, and there was a justifiable concern over whether he could do so, as there were 2 children to take care of. In the present case, there was less of a concern the Father would be overwhelmed as he only had 1 child to look after.

44     I ordered that the parties would able to take the Child overseas during their time with the Child. As explained above, the present facts were distinguishable from _BEP_, and I had confidence that the Father would be able to step up to the responsibility of taking care of the Child. However, to give the parties some time to adjust, I would allow overseas access to begin when the Child turned 4.

45     During the Clarification, the Mother’s counsel explained that when read with my orders for access, this order would have the effect of providing that until the Child begins school in 2024, only the Father would be able to take the Child overseas for a period up to a week, as I did not provide for such continuous access to the Mother. It was submitted that the Mother should be allowed to take the Child overseas for a period of up to 14 days at a time as long as notice was given.

46     These arguments were not made at the hearing, and only at the Clarification. Therefore I dismissed them and made it clear my orders would remain the same. I should also clarify that I would not change my decision as I felt it struck a fair balance allowing the Child to spend time with his relatives from the maternal and paternal side who were both based overseas.

47     While both parties had family overseas, the maternal grandmother lived with the Child, and the Child was spending most of his nights in the year with the Mother. It was a lot more convenient for the maternal relatives to visit from Taiwan which was closer by and in the same time zone. On the other hand, the Father’s family were located in Sweden, which was in a different time zone and required longer travel. It was more facilitative for such family reunions to take place if the Father was to travel there, rather than the other way round. The 1 week would take into account the longer distance for travel and change of time zone when he travelled there with the Child to visit his family.

48     I also made standard orders for the handover and return of the Child’s passport for overseas access, and the handover and return of the Child for regular access. These orders are set out below together with my orders on overseas access.

> a)     Both parties will be permitted to take the child on overseas trips during their access once the Child reaches 4 years old. When taking the Child overseas, each party will give written notice to the other parent on the destination, duration, flight details, phone contact details. 48 hours notice is required if the child is travelling in South East Asia. If the child is travelling beyond South East Asia, then 1 week’s notice must be given. Mother will hold on to the passport and travel documents of the child, and hand them over to the Father when presenting the child for overseas access. The Father will return these documents with the child when returning the child from overseas access.

> b)     The Child’s residence will be the pick up and return point for the Father’s access.

## D.   CHILD MAINTENANCE

49     The earning capacities of both parents informed my determination of the expenses of the Child, and the apportionment of their share of the Child’s expenses.

50     Both parents worked for financial institutions. I found that the Mother’s earning capacity was about $160,000.00. This took into account her net pay of $166,803.60 in 2019 (after deducting tax and pension fund contributions). I found that the Father’s net earning capacity was about $120,000.00. While his net pay after contributions to his Central Provident Fund (and before tax deductions) was about $97,200.00 as indicated by his bank statements, his net pay in his IRAS Notices of Assessment in 2017 and 2018 (after deducting tax as there were no CPF contribution) was about $133,100.00 and $128,221.80 respectively.

51     The Mother claimed the Father might be earning a basic salary of up to $11,500.00 with bonuses. This was on the basis that he was running his own company and could easily hide the payments. I disagreed with her for the following reasons:

> a)     The Father did run his own company of which he was the sole director and Chief Executive Officer of. However this company was actually a corporate vehicle created for him to continue working for his Swedish employer in Singapore. A message between the parties in 13 February 2019 shows that the Mother also understood that he was really just an employee in the larger scheme of things.

> (emphasis in bold, underline and italics)

> b)     The above message also indicates that at best and subject to fluctuations in the SEK (Swedish Kronor), the Father would take home $9,500.00 before tax deductions. In any event, I had already made the finding that the Father’s current income was exceeded by his earning capacity of $120,000.00.

53     My reasons for reducing the expenses claimed by the Mother are set out below.

#### _Food and Groceries_

54     The sum of $750 was based on $20 a day for food ($600), $100 for diapers and hygiene products and $50 for groceries from Taiwan. This was on the basis that the Mother was using “quality” ingredients to prepare food for the Child at home. I took the view that there was also quality to be found at $450 a month as the Child would now be spending more access time at the Father’s home, and it was not clear why groceries had to be purchased from Taiwan. The Child was also 3 years old, and would eventually be weened off diapers, so these expenses could be captured under clothes or miscellaneous items.

#### _Preschool and Rental_

55     The Mother stated that the Child’s current preschool offered the best education of all the pre-schools in the vicinity of her home, which was located close to the central shopping district. She paid a monthly rental of $4,100 for her home.

56     The basis for selecting this preschool was set out at paragraph 91 of the Mother’s submissions which I reproduce below:

> _“With regard to section 69(4) of the (Women’s Charter), it is clear from parties’ correspondence that they expected (the Child) to attend a top-tier preschool in (the Child’s) neighborhood. Although the (Father) disagreed with sending (the Child) to the (current preschool), he suggested Superland in UE Square, Eton House in Robertson Quay and Little Skool in Marina Boulevard as pre-school options for (the Child).”_

57     I believe this was a reference to section 69(4)(g) of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353), which states that one of the factors to be considered in ordering maintenance for the child is _“the manner in which he was being and in which the parties to the marriage expected him to be, educated or trained”_.

58     A closer consideration of the parties’ correspondence in Father’s 2nd Ancillary Affidavit at pages 126 to 132 that the Mother submissions referred to, confirmed that:

> a)     Parties differed in their expectations of the Child’s preschool education.

> b)     The Father was willing to look beyond the Child’s immediate neighbourhood in his search for a preschool. However, the Mother was more disposed to options in the immediate neighbourhood. Eton House was dismissed as it was 40 minutes from the Child’s home, and the Mother considered Little Skool House being “_too far away_” from home, even though it was actually located near her workplace in the central business district. She also objected to Little Skool House, as she did not want the Child “_to join the morning hectic commutes_”.

> c)     The Mother felt that the current preschool was placed ahead of the rest of the other preschools, as it was the closest to the Child’s home – right across the road. Concerns were raised about how the other preschools were “_super dingy_”, had catered food, lacked an outdoor playground or space.

59     I do not doubt that all parents want the best for their children, and also accept that the school fees in the vicinity of the where the Mother lived would be on the higher side. However the costs incurred must be sustainable. Section 69(4) also requires the Court to look at all the circumstances of the case and not just the factors set out in Section 69(4)(a) to (h). The reasonableness of the expense in particular must also be considered (_UHA v UHB_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHCF 12</span>, \[46,47\].

60     The parties were no longer living together and the Father would have to find his own accommodation and incur his own set of living expenses. I am sure that it was convenient for the Mother to select a pre-school near home, but if she was willing to look slightly further or even someplace near her workplace, there would also be good options and she could also rely on the maternal grandmother to fetch the Child there. Therefore I reduced the childcare expenses to $1,600.

61     On the rental costs of the Mother’s home, I took the view it should be split three ways as the maternal grandmother lived with them - $1,399. Even after taking that into account, I rounded the cost of rental downwards to $1,000 as I believed it was not reasonable for the Mother to have an expectation that the Father would fund the costs of living directly in the centre of town.

#### _Books, Medical Expenses and Music Classes_

62     I took the view that the Child’s medical expenses could be reduced to zero, as the bulk of these expenses were covered by the Mother’s health plan with her employer. If there were any miscellaneous medical expenses, they could be addressed under miscellaneous expenses of $50. Similarly the cost of books could also be covered under these miscellaneous expenses.

63     In respect of the music classes, I reduced them to $50 a month, taking into account the considerable expenses already being incurred for the rental and preschool.

##### II.    _Quantum of Child Maintenance_

64     In respect of the quantum of child maintenance, the methodology proposed by the Mother was that parties should apportion the Child’s expenses equally based on their income. This was the position taken in _TBC v TBD_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 59</span>. I agreed with the Mother, so I split the Child’s expenses of $3,290 equally – requiring the Father to pay a monthly maintenance of $1,650 (rounding up), to be paid on the 1st day of the month with effect from 1 August 2020.

##### III.    _Backdating of Child Maintenance_

65     The Mother submitted that the child maintenance should be backdated to May 2019, which was the date that the Father left the matrimonial home, citing the case of _AMW v AMZ_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 3 SLR 955</span>. It was pointed out that the Father had paid the Mother interim maintenance of the following amounts:

> a)     29 June 2019 to November 2019 - $500 per month.

> b)     15 November 2019 onwards - $810 per month.

66     I took the view that a backdating would not be ordered. The Mother’s submissions stated that Child maintenance should be backdated on the basis that the Consent Order was made without prejudice to the Court’s power to backdate, as well as the repayments by the Father cited above. However there were no other facts cited in support of why the Father would have the capacity to make this payment. Without more, there was not sufficient ground to grant the request to backdate.

## E.   CONCLUSION AND COSTS
