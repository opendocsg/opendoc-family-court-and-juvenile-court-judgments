Family Law – Variation – s128, Women’s Charter (Cap. 353)

2 April 2019

### District Judge Cheryl Koh:

## A.    Introduction

1       Summons 2076 & 3646 of 2018 are parties’ cross-applications to vary the Order of Court dated 23 March 2015 and 5 January 2016 in relation to the Plaintiff father’s (the “**Father**”) access to the child.

2       I _inter alia_ varied the Father’s alternate weekend access (Friday 6.00PM to Sunday 7.30PM) to weekly weekend access (Friday 6.00PM to Saturday 7.00PM in the first week, and Saturday 6.00PM to Sunday 7.00PM in the second week, and this arrangement to continue on an alternate week basis). I also ordered for each party to bear their own costs. The Defendant mother (the “**Mother**”) has appealed against these orders.

3       Parties’ disagreement arises over the child’s enrichment classes scheduled on the weekends: the child is scheduled to attend English lessons from 11.00AM to 1.00PM every Saturday, as well as Chinese lessons from 9.00AM to 10.45AM and speech and drama class from 4.30PM to 6.00PM every Sunday. The Father argued that these enrichment classes were scheduled without his consent and diminish the quality time he is able to spend with the child on his alternate weekend access. The Mother argued that the Father did not raise objections when these classes were scheduled on the weekends. In my view, these applications concern trivial issues for which parties ought to have been able to resolve on their own without resorting to litigation. The role of the Court in family disputes is not to substitute parties’ parenting decisions with its own or to manage the children’s daily timetables: it is certainly not for the Court to have to decide whether their child should attend enrichment classes, whether these classes should be scheduled on the weekdays or the weekends, or whether they should fall within the Father’s access time or otherwise. Be that as it may, since both parties have referred the dispute to the Court, I have adjusted the Father’s access to ensure that it is not unduly taken up by the child’s enrichment classes.

## B.    Background facts

4       Parties were married on 4 June 2010. Interim Judgment was granted on 24 August 2014. There is one child to the marriage, a boy born on 30 August 2010 and currently aged about 9 years old.

5       The consent Order of Court dated 23 March 2015 (recorded by consent on some ancillary matters) provides that the Father is responsible to ensure that the child attends his enrichment/school activities that occur during his access. By a further ancillary matters order dated 5 January 2016 (ordered by the Court on the remaining ancillary matters which were not agreed to), it was ordered for the Father to have alternate weekend access from Friday 6.00PM to Sunday 7.30PM.

6       At the time of 2015/2016 orders, the child only had one weekend class, which was his English class on Saturdays from 11.00AM to 1.00PM. The child’s speech and drama and Chinese classes were on weekdays. In 2017, the Mother rescheduled the child’s speech and drama and Chinese classes to the weekends. The same arrangement continued in 2018. The child began to miss several enrichment classes during the Father’s alternate weekend access.

7       The Mother applied to:

(a)     change the timing for the Father’s public holiday access;

(b)     remove the Father’s access to the child for the child’s birthday; and

(c)     vary the Father’s alternate weekend and holiday access such that the Father’s alternate weekend access would be limited to only Friday 8.00PM to Saturday 8.00PM, so that the Mother would have all Sundays and is able to send the child for his Sunday classes.

8       The Father applied:

(a)     to appoint a Child Representative; and

(b)     for an order that any existing or future classes, tuition, enrichment activities fixed during the Father’s access period shall be arranged with the Father’s consent.

9       On 19 December 2018, I made the following orders:

(a)     adjusted the timing of the Father’s public holiday access and access for the child’s birthday;

(b)     varied the Father’s alternate weekend access to weekly access (Friday 6.00PM to Saturday 7.00PM in the first week, and Saturday 6.00PM to Sunday 7.00PM in the second week, and for this arrangement to continue on an alternate week basis);

(c)     ordered for the Father to ensure that the child attends his English lessons every Saturday if his access falls on Saturday and also attends the speech and drama class on Sundays if his access falls on a Sunday (unless the child has a medical certificate). There shall only be one enrichment class fixed on each of Saturday or Sunday; and

(d)     ordered for each party to bear their own costs.

10     Parties have filed the following affidavits in the applications:

(a)     the Mother’s 1st Affidavit filed on 14 June 2018 (the “**Mother’s 1st Affidavit**”);

(b)     the Father’s Reply Affidavit filed on 11 October 2018 (the “**Father’s 1st Affidavit**”);

(c)     the Mother’s Reply Affidavit filed on 30 October 2018 (the “**Mother’s 2nd Affidavit**”); and

(d)     the Father’s final Reply Affidavit filed on 8 December 2018 (the “**Father’s 2nd Affidavit**”).

## C.    Grounds of Decision

11     The Father argued that when he had consented to bringing the child for his enrichment classes during his access, the child only had one weekend class at the time, which was English class on Saturday. However, in 2017 and 2018, the Mother then unilaterally rescheduled the child’s speech and drama and Chinese classes, which were originally on weekdays, to weekends. When the child missed these enrichment classes during the Father’s alternate weekend access, there were valid reasons such as that the child was unwell or did not wish to attend. The Father was of the view that the enrichment classes should not override the importance of the quality time the child should spend with the Father on his alternate weekend access.

12     The Mother argued that the Father did not raise objections when she rescheduled the child’s speech and drama and Chinese classes to the weekends. She could no longer keep these classes on the weekday afternoons because the child had begun primary one in the afternoon session.

13     As the Mother applied to limit the Father’s alternate weekend access to only Saturdays so that she could bring the child for his classes on Sundays, I decided to adjust the Father’s alternate weekend access to weekly access every Saturday. In this manner, the Father would only need to bring the child for one class every Saturday and it would be up to the Mother if she wanted to bring the Child for the other two classes on Sundays.

14     Upon hearing the Court’s indication, the Mother’s counsel informed that the Mother would move one of the two classes (i.e., Chinese class) on Sundays to a weekday, hence there would only be one class (i.e., speech and drama class) on a Sunday. It was further submitted that if the Court was minded to award the Father weekly Saturday access, the Court should instead award the Father Saturday access for one week and Sunday access for the following week, so that the Mother could also spend Saturdays with the child. I hence made the orders set out in \[9(b) and (c)\] herein accordingly.

15     I further ordered that each party bears their own costs. This is because both parties ought to have been able to resolve the scheduling of the child’s enrichment classes on their own instead of referring this dispute to the Court, hence each of them should bear their own consequences of their actions.
