Family law – Ancillary matters

17 January 2020

### District Judge Guy Ghazali:

## Introduction

1       Parties married on 25 July 2003 in Ireland.

2       There are two children to the marriage. As at the date of my orders, the children (both female) are 10 and 9 years old.

3       The Plaintiff-Wife (“the Wife”) filed the Writ for Divorce on 29 June 2016.

4       Interim Judgment was granted on 29 December 2016 based on the Defendant-Husband’s (“the Husband”) adultery and unreasonable behaviour. As at the date of the Interim Judgment, parties had been married for 13 years and 5 months.

5       Parties have agreed in an earlier consent order dated 2 March 2017 to have joint custody of the two children. As for care and control, parties have agreed at the ancillary matters hearing that the Wife shall have sole care and control of the children. The remaining issues before me for determination are the division of matrimonial assets, maintenance of the Wife and the two children and the Husband’s access to the children.

## Division of the matrimonial assets

##### (i)    The Surrey Property

6       The main matrimonial asset is a property at Surrey, United Kingdom (the Surrey property”). The value of the Surrey property is disputed. However, no formal valuation has been put forward by either party.

7       The Husband values the Surrey property at GBP 780,000. In this regard, the Husband relies on an online advertisement of a “3 bedroom semi-detached house for sale” but in a different residential area.

8       The Wife values the Surrey property at GBP 715,000. This is an estimated value of the Surrey property as generated by an online search engine that provides estimated values of residential properties in the United Kingdom.

9       Taking into consideration the bases for their values and in the absence of a formal valuation, I have adopted the Wife’s figure of GBP 715,000 as the value of the Surrey property.

10     As for the outstanding loan on the Surrey property, this is agreed at GBP 240,656.23. The net value of the Surrey property is therefore GBP 474,343.77.

11     The Wife claims that her brother had loaned the parties a total sum of GBP 45,000, which was used towards the purchase of the Surrey property. The Husband accepts that a loan was extended by the Wife’s brother but disputes the amount. On the evidence, the Wife is only able to show three transfers made on 7 December 2009, 8 December 2009 and 10 December 2009 in the sums of GBP 10,000, GBP 10,000 and GBP 6,000 respectively. It is the Husband’s Counsel’s submissions at the hearing of this matter that only this total sum of GBP 26,000 (as evidenced by supporting documents) ought to be taken into account in determining parties’ direct financial contributions to the Surrey property. It is the Husband’s position that the sum of GBP 26,000 (which he says is the loan amount) ought to be attributed to him wholly as he had fully repaid the loan. While the Wife does not dispute that that Husband had repaid the loan, she claims that the amount of GBP 45,000 (which she says is the loan amount) ought to be attributed to her wholly as it was her brother who extended the loan to them and without the loan, they would not have been able to acquire the Surrey property.

12     Having considered the evidence, I am of the view that only a loan of GBP 26,000 was proven. I am attributing this sum wholly to the Husband. Even though this sum was originally a loan from the Wife’s brother, it was the Husband who repaid the loan.

13     It is not disputed that apart from the loan from the Wife’s brother, the Husband made the remaining cash payment towards the acquisition of the Surrey property. This cash payment amounted to GBP 63,468.47 (this amount is disputed by the Wife following her position on the loan amount taken from her brother). I am attributing this sum of GBP 63,468.47 wholly to the Husband.

14     The remaining purchase price of the Surrey property was funded by a bank loan.

15     The Husband submits that he made a one-time payment of GBP 50,000 in July 2016 to reduce the outstanding bank loan amount on the Surrey property. The Husband has produced supporting document to show this. As such, I am attributing a further sum of GBP 50,000 to the Husband as his direct financial contributions to the Surrey property.

16     The other main contention between the parties is the attribution of the rental income from the Surrey property that was used to repay the mortgage loan.

17     The following facts are established on the evidence of the parties:

> i.     The Surrey property was rented out from January 2013 to September 2016 with rental income of GBP 2,150 per month. The Surrey property was then vacant for a period of six months between October 2016 and March 2017. From April 2017 until March 2018, the Surrey property was rented out for GBP 1,950 per month. It was vacant for a month in April 2018 before it was rented out again from May 2018 until September 2018 for GBP 1,950 per month. From October 2018 until September 2019 (i.e. at the time of this hearing), the Surrey property was rented out for GBP 1,850 per month. Until May 2017, the rental income went into the Husband’s sole account. It was thereafter paid into the Wife’s account.

> ii.     The mortgage repayment was GBP 2,240.15 per month. It was increased to GBP 2,271.62 per month in September 2018. From January 2010 until July 2017, mortgage repayments were made from the Husband’s sole account. Thereafter, the Wife took over the mortgage repayments.

18     It is the Husband’s Counsel’s submission that the mortgage repayments from January 2010 until July 2017 ought to be attributed to the Husband solely as his direct financial contributions to the Surrey property while the mortgage repayments from August 2017 until September 2019 are to be attributed to the Wife. The Wife disagrees with this approach as she submits that she ought to be given a higher attribution for the periods during which rental income was used to defray the mortgage repayments as she played a major role in securing tenancy for the Surrey property.

19     Having considered the evidence, I am of the view that the rental income received during the different periods of tenancy ought to be attributed equally between the parties. Where there were excess payments made by the parties from their respective bank accounts, I am attributing these payments to the party from whose account payment was made.

20     In the circumstances, the parties’ direct financial contributions towards the Surrey property can be summarised as follows.

##### (ii)    Total matrimonial pool

21     Both parties have agreed to exclude their joint Lloyds Bank account due to its negligible bank balance. I have accordingly excluded this asset from the matrimonial pool.

23     In arriving at these values, parties have agreed to the conversion rate of GBP 1 = $1.75.

24     With regard to the assets in the parties’ respective names, items 3 and 6 to 13 in the table at \[22\] are not in dispute.

25     As for the Husband’s UK pension fund, the Husband has declared its value as $913,864. However, it is the Husband’s Counsel’s submission that the court should not adopt its entire value but instead a 10/23 share of the value, which works out to $397,332 (rounded down to nearest dollar). The Husband’s Counsel submits that whilst the pension fund started in 1990, the court should take into account that the parties married only in 2003 and that the Husband moved to Singapore in 2013 (at which time the money in the pension fund is assumed to have stopped accumulating). Accordingly, only 10 years (from 2003 until 2013) ought to be taken into account. I accept the Husband’s position. However, as I am pro-rating the Husband’s UK pension fund, I am similarly pro-rating the value of the Wife’s UK pension fund. On the basis that the Wife’s UK pension fund started in 1988, I have adopted a value representing 10/25 of the declared value of $241,617.27, which is, $96,646.91.

26     For items 2, 4, 14 and 15, I have adopted the values closest to the date of the Interim Judgment. In this regard, the Husband has declared the values of items 14 and 15 as -$62.50 and -$8,031.15 (negative values) respectively. The Husband has adopted values as at 30 April 2019. On the evidence and the Husband’s Counsel’s submissions, these accounts started to have deficits in November 2018 (for item 14) and 1 February 2017 (for item 15). Interim Judgment was granted on 29 December 2016. I have therefore adopted the values as at 29 December 2016 instead ($34,579.82 for item 14 and GBP 4,614.98 or $8,076.22 for item 15). Similarly, for the Wife’s accounts, I have taken the values as at the date of/nearest to the Interim Judgment. Based on the bank statements, the value of item 2 is -GBP 2,289.07 or -$4,005.87 (negative value). As for item 4, I have relied on the 11 April 2017 bank statement containing the December 2016 entry and have adopted the value of $6,652.40.

27     For the Marriott Vacation membership, it is the Husband’s position that it does not have a positive value. Instead, there is an outstanding loan of $10,636.63 to be paid off by June 2020. In response, the Wife contends that the membership has a potential resale value as the Husband will be able to resell the membership to an external party upon paying off the outstanding loan in June 2020. For present purposes, I have ascribed a nil value for this asset. Even though the present value of this asset is negative due to the outstanding loan, the Husband will be able to resell it after paying off the loan.

##### (iii)    Indirect contributions

28     For indirect contributions, the Wife has submitted 80:20 in her favour while the Husband’s Counsel has submitted 50-50. Having considered the relevant facts, I am of the view that 70:30 in favour of the Wife is appropriate in the circumstances. In arriving at this ratio, I have taken into consideration, _inter alia_, the following:

> i.     The Wife is and has been the primary caregiver for the two children.

> ii.     The Wife has been working for a significant part of the marriage (albeit not continuous) and has been making financial contributions to the family. The Wife has also made financial provisions towards the maintenance and upkeep of the Surrey property and plays a major role in ensuring that the Surrey property is tenanted to generate rental income utilised towards mortgage repayments.

> iii.     The Wife has made sacrifices in her career for the sake of the family and the Husband’s progression in his career.

> iv.     The Husband earns significantly more than the Wife, enabling him to make greater financial contributions to the family.

##### (iv)    Average ratio

29     The average ratio is therefore as follows

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="62.26%"> <col width="20.28%"> <col width="17.46%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Wife</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Husband</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Direct financial contributions</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(50% weightage)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">22</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">78</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Indirect contributions</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(50% weightage)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">70</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">30</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Average ratio</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">46</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">54</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Adjusted ratio, taking into account needs of the children</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">50</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">50</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

30     I have adjusted the ratio from an average of 46:52 to 50:50, taking into account the needs of the children. The Wife’s 50% share of the matrimonial pool works out to $804,936.98.

31     In implementing the abovementioned order for division, the Surrey property is dealt with separately from the other matrimonial assets.

32     I am ordering that the Surrey property be sold within six months from the date of this order and the proceeds of sale, less the outstanding loan on the property and costs and expenses related to the sale, shall be divided equally between the parties. The parties shall have joint conduct of sale. From the Husband’s share of the net sale proceeds of the Surrey property, a sum of $214,276.11 shall be paid to the Wife. The payment of this sum of $214,276.11 is to effect an equal division of the other matrimonial assets (apart from the Surrey property) with parties retaining assets in their respective names.

## Maintenance of the Wife and the two children

33     There is an existing consent order dated 2 March 2017 for interim maintenance for the Wife and the two children. Under the said consent order, the Husband is to pay $12,000 per month for the maintenance of the Wife and the two children on the 1st day of each month. In addition, the Husband shall pay the children’s school fees and school transport charges.

34     The Husband is a doctor with an annual _net_ income of $462,571 (or $38,547.58 per month). The Wife is a clinic manager with an annual _net_ income of $64,600 (or $5,383.33 per month).

35     The Husband offers to pay maintenance of $10,300 per month for both children inclusive of school fees (which the Husband’s Counsel indicates to be about $6,700) and no maintenance for the Wife. The Wife asks for maintenance of $12,000 for herself and the two children. In addition, the Husband is to pay the children’s school fees. The Wife’s proposal is the same as the interim maintenance order except that the Wife is prepared to forgo her claim for the children’s transport costs.

36     Having considered the parties’ positions, I am of the view that there has been no material change of circumstances that warrants a departure from the existing maintenance order. In this regard, I note that the Wife’s proposal of $12,000 plus payment of school fees is less than the sum total of the present interim maintenance order. As such, I am ordering for the Husband to pay the Wife $12,000 a month for the maintenance of the Wife and the two children on the 1st day of each month with effect from 1 November 2019. In addition, the Husband shall bear the children’s school fees.

## Access to the two children

37     Based on the Husband’s Counsel’s submissions, the Husband wants access to the children every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from after school until 7.30 pm as well as overnight access from Saturday 10 am or after the children’s swimming training, whichever is later, until Sunday 11 am. For non-schooling days, the Husband asks for Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 6 pm to 8 pm. The Husband also asks for alternate public holiday access from the eve of the public holiday at 5 pm until 7 pm the next day, birthday access on his birthday and the children’s birthdays and overseas access.

38     The Mother is generally agreeable to the Husband’s proposal save that she points out that for overseas access, the children are still fairly young and have not been away from her for long periods.

39     In the circumstances, I am allowing the Father to have:

> i.     Weekday access to the children every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from after school until 7.30 pm. If these days are non-schooling days, access shall be from 6 pm to 8 pm.

> ii.     Weekend overnight access from 10 am on Saturday or after the children’s swimming training, whichever is later, until Sunday at 11 am.

> iii.     Alternate public holiday access (excluding public holidays that fall on Saturday or Sunday or Christmas or New Year’s Day) from 5 pm on the eve of the public holiday or after school, whichever is later, until 7 pm on the public holiday. (In the event that the Husband’s weekday access coincides with the parties’ alternate public holiday time, parties’ alternate public holiday time shall take precedence.)

> iv.     Two hours on the Father’s birthday or the children’s birthdays (if these days fall on the Father’s non-access days).

> v.     Half of the children’s summer school holidays, December school holidays and Easter school holidays, commencing summer holidays of 2020, with liberty to take the children overseas except that the Husband’s overseas holidays with the children shall not exceed two weeks at any one time. The Husband’s holiday access with the children shall commence during the summer holidays of 2020. The Husband shall provide the Wife with one month’s advance notice of intention of such travel. The Husband shall also provide the Wife with information on dates of travel, mode of travel, itinerary, accommodation and contact details at least two weeks before the travel.

> vi.     New Year’s Day and Christmas on one year, commencing 2020, to be alternated with the Wife (i.e. the Husband will spend New Year’s Day 2020 and Christmas 2020 with the children while the Wife will spend New Year’s Day 2021 and Christmas 2021 with the children, to be alternated on that basis).

40     The above orders are very much in line with the framework sought for by the Father but with certain modifications, taking into account the children’s ages, schedules and practicalities.

41     I have not made provisions for replacement access as it appears on evidence that the Husband travels extensively and to make specific provisions for replacement access may be disruptive to the children’s schedules. Parties are nevertheless not precluded from agreeing to or making arrangements for replacement access.

## My orders

42     In conclusion, my orders are as follows:

> i.     Parties shall sell the Surrey property within six months from the date of this order and the proceeds of sale, less the outstanding loan on the property and costs and expenses related to the sale, shall be divided equally between the parties. From the Husband’s share of the net sale proceeds of the Surrey property, a sum of $214,276.11 shall be paid to the Wife. Parties shall have joint conduct of sale.

> ii.     Save as set out above, parties shall retain assets in their respective names.

> iii.     The Wife shall have sole care and control of the two children of the marriage with access to the Husband as follows:

>> a.       Weekday access every Monday, Wednesday and Friday after school until 7.30 pm. On school holidays (excluding public holidays), the Husband’s weekday access shall be from 6 pm to 8 pm.

>> b.       Weekend access every Saturday from 10 am or after the children’s swimming training, whichever is later, until Sunday at 11 am.

>> c.       Alternate public holiday access from 5 pm on the eve of the public holiday or after school, whichever is later, until 7 pm on the public holiday. For the avoidance of doubt, in determining alternate public holiday access, parties shall not include public holidays that fall on Saturday or Sunday as well as Christmas and New Year’s Day. In the event that the Husband’s weekday access coincides with the parties’ alternate public holiday time, the parties’ alternate public holiday time shall take precedence.

>> d.       If the Husband’s birthday or the children’s birthdays fall on the Husband’s non-access days, the Husband shall have access to the children for two hours on these days.

>> e.       Parties shall share each of the children’s summer school holidays, December school holidays and Easter school holidays equally, with liberty to take the children overseas except that the Husband’s overseas holidays with the children shall not exceed two weeks at any one time and shall commence during the summer holidays of 2020. The Husband shall provide the Wife with one month’s advance notice of intention of such travel. The Husband shall also provide the Wife with information on dates of travel, mode of travel, itinerary, accommodation and contact details at least two weeks before the travel.

>> f.       Parties shall spend Christmas and New Year’s Day with the children on an alternate basis commencing Christmas 2019 to the Wife and New Year’s Day 2020 to the Husband.

>> g.       In the event that the Husband is unable to exercise access during the time that he is entitled to under this order, the children shall be with the Wife with no replacement access to the Husband unless otherwise agreed between the parties.

> iv.     The Husband shall pay the Wife a sum of $12,000 per month on the 1st day of each month with effect from 1 November 2019 for the maintenance of the Wife and the two children. Payment shall be made into the Wife’s DBS Bank Account No. xxxxxx3783. In addition, the Husband shall bear the children’s school fees, payable directly to the school.

> v.     Each party shall bear his/her own costs.

> vi.     There shall be liberty to apply.
