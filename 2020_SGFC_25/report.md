## District Judge Sheik Mustafa:

## Introduction

1       This case revolves around the guardianship of a 17-year old child, to whom I shall refer as “C”. His aunt is his guardian, who had been appointed by an order of court of September 2017.

2       C’s aunt applies now to the Court for the guardianship order to be discharged. C’s biological parents are the defendants. They both object to the application. Having heard the parties, I dismiss the aunt’s application.

## Historical background of the case

3       C’s mother and father were previously married to each other. C was born to them in 2002. The parents were divorced in January 2007. The divorce was finalised in April 2007. C was 5 years old.

4       C’s parents agreed for the Court to order his mother to have sole custody, care and control of him. His father agreed to an order to contribute $400.00 a month for his maintenance. After the divorce, C lived with his mother.

5       In July 2016, C went to his maternal grandmother and did not return home. Soon after that he went to live with his aunt.

6       In August 2016, C’s aunt, on behalf of C, applied to this Court for a personal protection order against C’s mother. She also applied for a maintenance order.

7       In February 2017, C’s mother consented to the PPO application and to the maintenance application.

8       In April 2017, C’s aunt applied to this Court to be appointed as C’s legal guardian, pursuant to section 5 of the Guardianship and Infants Act (Cap. 122). In September 2017, by consent of both C’s mother and father, C’s aunt was appointed as C’s sole legal guardian. Additionally, C’s mother was ordered to pay $700.00 to his aunt for C’s maintenance. C’s father’s maintenance contribution was to remain at $400.00, payable to C’s aunt instead.

9       C is now 17 years old. He attends at a polytechnic.

10     C’s aunt filed an application against the parents for an increase in maintenance, and an application to rescind the PPO against the mother. Both applications were contested. In June 2019, she withdrew the maintenance summons, and filed the present summons to be discharged as C’s sole guardian.

## Facts presented

##### C’s aunt, the guardian

11     C’s aunt submits that she is no longer able to protect C’s best interest. She is suffering from undifferentiated connective tissue disease, which also caused her to suffer other medical conditions, including prolapsed intervertebral disc (slipped disc) and left hip degenerative labral tear.

12     As a result of this condition, C’s aunt was on medical leave from September 2018 to June 2019. The illness impacts in her ability to work, causing her income to fall substantially. She is not be able to manage the shortfall in C’s growing monthly expenses. Further, C has progressed to the polytechnic for a diploma.

13     C’s aunt argues that owing to her condition, she is not be able to spend the same level of quality time and keep track of C’s physical and emotional wellbeing as she did before. She is no longer able to wash, cook and clean. She also does not have the time to monitor his school progress. She submits that C’s mother is in a superior position to protect C’s best interests.

##### C’s mother

14     C’s mother submits that she is not a suitable parent to care for C for the very same reasons that the aunt was appointed sole guardian in the first place. She submits that since the guardianship order was made, she has accepted that C does not want to have any relationship with her, and she has moved on with life without C. She says that C has become a stranger to her. She argues that the best interest and welfare of C is met if the guardianship order is maintained. She states the following key reasons:

> a.     She is an unfit parent;

> b.     She cannot provide a stable environment;

> c.     She does not wish to, and is unable to accept C;

> d.     C does not genuinely wish to return to live with her; and

> e.     C’s aunt or father are best placed to provide stability and care for C.

15     C’s mother recounts that in the years leading up to the guardianship order, she had a quarrelsome, and at times violent, relationship with C. She admits to and relies on the same allegations that were made against her previously, which led to the PPO and guardianship order. She admits to be a violent and irresponsible mother, that she had repeatedly committed family violence and abuse on C, that she had hit and kicked C on his shoulders and stomach, that she sent abusive, threatening and vulgar WhatsApp messages to C, that she slammed C’s head repeatedly against a door; that she poked C in the eye with a pole; that she threw a pair of kitchen scissors at C, causing it to be lodged in his nose bridge, and that she went to work overseas leaving C to the care of the aunt.

16     She argues that there has not been any family violence in the past three years since C moved to live with his aunt, but this is solely due to a lack of meetings between the C and her.

17     She claims to have concerns regarding her poor anger management and frequent outbursts. She argues that this aspect of her behaviour has not changed and that she is not be able to perform her duties as a parent if C is placed back into her custody, care and control.

18     C’s mother says that she is rarely at home, including on weekends, because of her work commitments or night classes. As such, if C is returned to her care, she is likely to be an absent parent. Her living situation also makes it difficult for her to accommodate C. She says that she lives in a rented one-bedroom apartment, and the HDB flat that she owns is not in a comfortable state to live in. She has limited means and is presently in credit card debt.

19     In addition, she suffers from various medical conditions that would require her to undergo regular tests and be under periodic supervision and treatments.

20     Based on these reasons, she argues that she is therefore neither a fit parent nor is she able to provide a suitable and conducive environment for C to be raised.

21     C’s mother also submits that she no longer has any meaningful relationship with C. She claims that she had repeatedly attempted to meet with C and to reconcile her relationship with him. However, each time, C ignored her invitations and/or refused to meet with her. At the guardianship hearing in 2017, C informed her outside the courtroom that he no longer wished to live with her; she has accepted this fact and has since moved on with her life. She has only communicated with C through WhatsApp or SMS on very limited and sporadic occasions.

22     This application to discharge the guardianship order came out of the blue and was a complete shock to her. She claims that there has never been any indication from either the aunt or C that he wished to return to live with her.

##### C’s father

23     C’s father submits that he is not able to take care of C. He has been completely estranged from C until 2017, when they met once on Chinese New Year. He hardly has contact with him. He has remarried and has a new family, with a daughter now 7 years old. Although he himself is not prepared to take on the care of C, he has no objections to either C’s aunt or mother doing so.

##### C’s wishes

24     A court counsellor and I had a meeting with C in the absence of the other parties. C presented to be a young person of 17 years old who was cognisant of the ongoing litigations revolving around him. He spoke well and had no apparent difficulty expressing his thoughts and feelings. He appeared well adjusted to polytechnic education and seemed to have given some thought to his care arrangements and plans.

25     C shared about how his aunt has been a dedicated guardian who would cook for him during weekends and showed concern over his well-being. Sadly, she was diagnosed with an illness in October 2018. He depicted how she faced much stress making adjustments, and adapting to her degenerative and debilitating condition. She was admitted to the hospital on several occasions, and she tried to make plans to seek gainful employment in another field, and to downgrade to a smaller home. He felt that his aunt will not be able to care for him, and that he did not wish to be a burden to her. He also spoke about how his grandmother, who lives with them, is also hospitalised. He tries to do his part by helping with the household chores and cooking for the family, and would probably do so if he continues to reside with his aunt and grandmother.

26     C recalled that he used to reside with his mother prior to Secondary 2. He was “abused” by her. He described that his mother threw a pair of scissors at him after he had accidentally spilled coffee; that she used a hanger to poke at his eyes when he was around 9 years old, and subjected him to continual verbal abuse. He cited examples of verbal abuse such as “asking me to go Boys’ Home”. He described about how he had to run away from home on 2 occasions to his grandmother’s then residence, as he was afraid that his mother would hit him. He continued to reside with his grandmother as his mother continued to verbally abuse him in text messages. He did not turn to his father for assistance as he had never met him then.

27     C recounted that following his relocation with his grandmother and aunt, his aunt took protective measures on his behalf, which included obtaining a personal protection and legal guardianship. He knows that he is receiving allowances from his parents ($700 from his mother and $400 from his father) for his personal use.

28     According to C, after he left home, his mother made some contact at the beginning “to get me back”. However, he was angry with his mother then, and did not respond to her. He has not maintained any form of contact with his mother for a period of 2 years, until a few months ago when his mother initiated contact with him via WhatsApp. C has limited knowledge about his mother’s whereabouts, well-being and accommodation over the last 3 years. His aunt informed him that his mother is currently working at a bank in the City, that she is residing in a rented condominium unit, and that that her HDB 2-room flat is rented out. However, his mother informed him otherwise, that she is residing at the HDB flat. He himself has not been to the flat to confirm this.

29     On what was a happy note in the discussion, C described how he reconnected with his father during Chinese New Year in 2017 at the latter’s residence. He recounted that his aunt accompanied him for the visit and that he would meet his father annually during the festivity since then. When asked about how he felt towards his father’s family, he replied that there is “nothing bad about him (his father)” and that he was happy and slightly amused to know that he has a younger (step)sister.

30     Among the family, C appeared to me to be closest to his aunt, whom he glowingly described as “always putting others before her… she has to sacrifice a lot of things”. He especially enjoys the festive and New Year party celebrations organized by her. He feels that he does not have any other family members whom he could turn to.

31     When asked about his perspective and wishes regarding his care arrangements and plans, C shared about the options that he perceived are available to him, and his order of preference.

32     His preference is to return to live with his mother. This preference is based on his belief that his mother is financially independent, and residing alone. He perceives this living arrangement being temporary, as he plans to relocate after securing gainful employment in the future, and after national service. He appears to believe that his mother would agree to accommodate him.

33     On the past incidents of violence by his mother, C believes that his mother has probably changed for the better, and that he is now older and mature enough to either seek police assistance, or return to his aunt’s residence, should his mother physically abuse him again.

34     On his father, C stated that residing with his father is not his preferred option as he does not wish to inconvenience his father, and that there might not be sufficient physical space to accommodate him. C also believes that his father may agree to accommodate him.

35     C believes that he will be placed in the Boys’ Home if neither of his parents take him in.

36     On the other hand, C is worried that there will not be sufficient physical space to accommodate him at his aunt’s new residence. Family finances was also another concern in view of the health conditions of his aunt and grandmother. When informed of the types of independent living hostels available, C expressed that his preference to reside with his mother remains as his preferred option, followed by independent living hostel and with the rest of the preferences thereafter.

37     It appears to me that C’s preference to return to his mother’s care is born out of his aunt’s predicament and financial constraints, a lack of emotional connection with his father, and his individual needs as a young person. Given the close relationship that he shares with his aunt and the protective measures that she previously took on his behalf, he sees his aunt’s residence as his place of safety. However, the possibility of not being able to continue residing with his aunt must have kicked in. This leads C to find himself having to rely on his parents instead; they are the only other adult figures with whom he shares familial relationships with.

## Applicable principles

38     The Guardianship of Infants Act is the fount of the law regarding the care of infants. The relevant provisions are as follows –

> **Welfare of infant to be paramount consideration**

> **3**.    - Where in any proceedings before any court the custody or upbringing of an infant … the court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration and, save in so far as such welfare otherwise requires, the father of an infant shall not be deemed to have any right superior to that of the mother in respect of such custody, administration or application, nor shall the mother be deemed to have any claim superior to that of the father.

> **Power of court to make, discharge or amend orders for custody and maintenance of infants**

> **5**.    The court may, upon the application of either parent or of any guardian appointed under this Act, make orders as it may think fit regarding the custody of such infant, the right of access thereto and the payment of any sum towards the maintenance of the infant and may alter, vary or discharge such order on the application of either parent or of any guardian appointed under this Act.

39     The case of _ABW v ABV_[^1] is also relevant. That was a case regarding the care of children consequent to a divorce, which, to that extent, is factually different from the situation here. However, what was stated by Judith Prakash J in that case is applicable here –

> “23    The decision as to what is in the best interests of any particular child depends on the circumstances of the individual case and the individual child. However, this does not mean that that decision is a subjective one for the judge hearing the case. Rather, a number of relevant circumstances should be taken into account when arriving at a decision. The stability factor is but one such circumstance. Others include:

>> (a)    The need for both parents to have an involvement in the child’s life;

>> (b)    Which parent shows the greater concern for the child;

>> (c)    The maternal bond;

>> (d)    The child’s wishes; and

>> (e)    The desirability of keeping siblings together.

> 24    The degree to which any one factor or the other is to be given pre-eminence is not fixed but depends entirely on the facts of each case…”

40     The learned counsel for the aunt strongly argued that the Court ought not order a guardian to continue to act in the event that the guardian has become unwilling to do so. I disagree. The willingness of a guardian is but one constituent of the factual matrix that the Court can consider in order to find out what is best for C. The duty and responsibility of being the guardian of a child is a grave and solemn one, such that both social and legal gravity attaches to it. It cannot be easily abdicated on the basis of the guardian’s unwillingness _alone_. A child who is placed in the guardianship of an adult must be assured that he or she is in a safe harbour that is not transient and is not affected by winds of willingness alone.

41     The learned counsel for the mother argued that if the aunt’s guardianship is discharged, it does not, ipso facto, mean that care of C will revert to C’s mother. I reject this argument. There is an existing court order from the divorce of the parents that ordered C’s mother to have care and control of C. That order is not revoked or varied. The guardianship order stands concurrently with it. If the guardianship order ends, then C’s mother must undertake the legal responsibility of care and control of C. The guardianship order did not sever any parent-child relationships. This is evident from the fact that even with the guardianship order in force, C’s mother still has a duty to maintain C, and upon the death of either of them, rights of survivorship will apply.

42     Having decided on these contentions, I find that the only question to be asked then is what is in the best interest of C, based on all the facts and circumstances of the case?

## Findings and conclusion

43     I carefully considered all the parties’ evidence and their submissions. I also considered my interview with C. I arrived at the following findings and conclusions.

44     C is presently in the guardianship of his aunt. He is happy and loved there. However, circumstances beyond the control or choice of his aunt has made it challenging to continue her care of him. This precipitated her application before me. It is clear to me that the motive behind this application is not due to a rejection of C, but due to concern that she may not be able to care for him any further.

45     This difficult situation compels C to decide on the options of moving back to live with his mother or to live with his father. C chooses the former. Unfortunately, this choice is premised on the erroneous belief that the alternative is to be sent to the Boys’ Home.

46     Further, his mother, his father and the Boys’ Home do not form the complete menu of options open to C. The choice of remaining in the care of his aunt remains an option.

47     C’s father has stated that he does not want to care for C. He has his own family. He and his family, until very recently, were totally estranged from C. Besides the acknowledgement of biological paternity, there exists no other relationship between them. C is happy that he has re-established a connection with his father, and appears to be delighted that he has a younger sister. However, he admits that he cannot see himself living with them.

48     So, C sees the only choice left for him is to move back to his mother’s care to avoid being sent to Boys’ Home. His mother objects to this.

49     In coming to my decision, I took into account C’s choice to be placed into his mother’s care, but I am bound to consider what is in his best interest. Is it in his best interest to be placed in the care of his mother who does not wish to care for him, the same mother against whom a protection order was made, his mother whom he knows little about, not even having visited her home for a long time? Or is it in his best interest to continue to be placed in the care of his aunt who took him in when he needed the protection, even though financial and health challenges have set in? In my conversation with C it was clear that he loves his aunt as the parent he never truly had. It is out of his love for her that he is willing to sacrifice his own comfort and safety, to offer to live with the mother who had been violent to him.

50     If the guardianship of the aunt is discharged, then C would nominally revert to be under the care and control of his mother, based on the divorce order of April 2007. Not only is his mother refusing to undertake the parental responsibility, I find that she is unfit to do so. I note that the PPO is still in force against her for the violence she committed on to C when he was younger and defenceless; and there is no evidence to assure that this will not be revisited upon C if he were to return to her. In fact, the aunt’s application to rescind the PPO is resisted by the mother. C himself admits that he has lost contact with his mother for an extended time, and I note that he does not even know anything about the living conditions that he wishes to be moving into. The same circumstances under which she was unsuitable to care for C in the past remain largely unchanged. I therefore find that to return C to her care cannot be in C’s best interest.

51     As for C’s father, he has been estranged from C for so long, that to expect him to care for C is not reasonable, and cannot be in C’s best interest either.

52     It is my finding that it is in the best interest of C is that he remains in the guardianship of his aunt. The mere fact that the aunt is no longer able to maintain him does not in itself render her to become so unsuitable a guardian that she ought to be discharged. There is no neglect or ill-treatment by the aunt. If the aunt is not able to support C, then she ought to look to C’s parents to contribute to his maintenance, and they are liable to do so.

53     For these reasons, I dismiss the aunt’s summons. Although counsel for the mother requests for it, I make no order on costs. It does not appear to me that the application is frivolous or that there is an ulterior motive behind this application. It is also in the public interest, and in the interest of children, that persons charged with their guardianship be able to seek the court’s directions regarding their care without undue concern on costs.
