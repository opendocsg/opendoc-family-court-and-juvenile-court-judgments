Family Law – Maintenance for Wife and children

29 July 2020

### District Judge Christine Lee:

### Introduction

1       There are two appeals in this case by the Wife. The first appeal by the Complainant Wife is in DCA 37 of 2020 against my decision in MSS 239/2020 in the Court Order dated 23 April 2020 regarding maintenance payments by the Respondent Husband to the Complainant Wife.

2       The second appeal by the Complainant Wife is in DCA 38 of 2020 against my decision in MSS 79/2020 in the Court Order also dated 23 April 2020 regarding the maintenance payments by the Respondent Husband to the Complainant Wife for the two (2) children of their marriage.

### Background Facts

3       The Complainant XXX (the Wife) and the Respondent XXX (the Husband) married on 29 September 2004 in China. There are 2 children from the marriage namely, XXX (f) DOB 24 June 2005 aged 15 years and XXX (m) DOB 4 July 2012 aged 8 years (“the 2 children”).

4       On 7 January 2020, the Wife filed an application for maintenance payments from the Husband for the 2 children in MSS 79/2020 in the sum of $9,000 per month being the sum of $4,500 per child.

5       On 17 January 2020, the Wife filed an application for maintenance payments from the Husband for herself in MSS 239/2020 in the sum of $5,000 per month. The total maintenance that was being sought from the Husband was therefore in the sum of $14,000 per month.

### Hearings before the Court

6       I dealt with both of the Wife’s applications for monthly maintenance for herself and the 2 children on 23 April 2020 via Zoom hearing, whereupon I delivered my decision on the same day.

7       The Wife filed the two Notices of Appeal on 29 April 2020 in HCF/DCA 37/2020 and HCF/DCA 38/2020 against the whole of both my decisions on the ground that the maintenance which I ordered the Husband to pay, was not enough to sustain the family.

### The Appeals

8       The Wife’s appeals are with regard to the provisions of the two Court Orders dated 23 April 2020 set out below:

> **Appeal in DCA 37/2020 (MSS 239/2020)**

> 1.    XXX is to pay to XXX a total of $2,000.00 per month as maintenance for XXX.

> 2.    The above-mentioned maintenance is to be paid on or before the 1st day of each month with effect from 01 May 2020 and is to be deposited by XXX into XXX’s POSB Bank account number XXX-XXXXX-X.

> **Appeal in DCA 38/2020 (MSS 79/2020)**

> 1.    XXX is to pay to XXX a total of $1,000.00 per month as maintenance for the two children namely, XXX and XXX. The above-mentioned sum comprises:

>> a.    $500.00 per month for XXX; and

>> b.    $500.00 per month for XXX.

> 2.    The above-mentioned maintenance is to be paid on or before the 1st day of each month with effect from 01 May 2020 and is to be deposited by XXX into XXX POSB Bank account number XXX-XXXXX-X.

### Assessment by the Court

9       Before making my decision on the maintenance payments by the Husband, I ascertained the basis for the Wife’s applications. The Wife provided the breakdown of her monthly expenses for herself at page 1 of Exhibit C, which was in the sum of $6,060. The Wife also provided the monthly expenses for the 2 children at page 1 of Exhibit C in the sum of $8,200 per month.

10     I took note of the Court of Appeal (CA) decision in the case of _Foo Ah Yan v Chiam Heng Chow <span class="citation">\[2012\] 2 SLR 506</span>_, wherein the CA stated that the objective of section 69 applications is to provide the Wife with a reasonable quantum of maintenance to help her overcome her **_immediate financial needs_** having regard to all the circumstances of the case (emphasis added).

11     I also took note of the factors set out in section 69 of the Women’s Charter including, the financial needs, earning capacity, income, financial resources and standard of living enjoyed by the Wife and 2 children. I also noted that it was not disputed that the younger child was a special needs child. The Wife also testified that she had been a housewife since the commencement of the marriage[^1], had no other sources of income and was not receiving any financial assistance other than maintenance from the Husband[^2].

12     Therefore, as a first step in considering the Wife’s application, I considered the Wife’s financial situation, noting that the Wife and 2 children were wholly dependent on the Husband as the sole breadwinner for the family and that they were all still living together in the same home.

13     I also took into account the Wife’s and 2 children’s total monthly expenses as submitted by the Wife at page 1 of Exhibit C. My assessment of these expenses are set out in the paragraphs below.

14      Maintenance for the Wife: I was of the view that the Wife’s application for maintenance for herself in the sum of $5,000 per month was not reasonable for the following reasons:

> a.     During cross-examination by the Husband, the Wife was shown to have inflated some amounts for the items set out in her monthly expenses form:-

>> i.       For example, regarding the household utilities bill which the Wife listed at $1,000. The Husband put to the Wife that this sum should be between $300 to $350 per month as that was the amount that he was currently paying. In response, the Wife admitted that the utilities bills were being paid by GIRO deductions from the Respondent’s bank account so she was just estimating the amount[^3].

>> ii.       Regarding the telephone bills, the Wife listed the sums of $200 for her monthly hand phone expenses and $300 for their daughter’s monthly hand phone expenses. In my view, such sums are on the high side, particularly for the 15 year old daughter’s hand phone expenses.

>> iii.       The Wife also testified that she had added the sum of $5,000 for travel expenses for their yearly travel during the school holidays to Japan, Taiwan and some parts of China[^4]. This was in addition to the sum of $900 which the Wife had listed for the item “Tour and Family Outings”.

> b.     I further noted that the Wife had listed the sum of $300 as “Maintenance (monthly)” for herself as part of her estimated monthly expenses of $6,060.

> c.     The Wife admitted that many of the items listed by her were her own estimates of what she thought she would have to pay in the future if there was a divorce[^5].

15     My assessment of the Wife’s reasonable monthly expenses as compared to the Wife’s amounts at page 1 of Exhibit C was as follows:

16     In the above assessment, I also noted the undisputed fact that the Wife did not have to pay for accommodation for herself and the 2 children as the matrimonial home in which they were still living, had been fully paid up by the Husband[^7].

17      Maintenance for the 2 children: I was of the view that the Wife’s application for maintenance for the 2 children in the monthly sum of $9,000 being $4,500 per child per month was also not reasonable for the following reasons:

> a.     During cross-examination by the Husband, the Wife was also shown to have inflated the amounts for some of the items set out in her monthly expenses form regarding the 2 children’s expenses:-

>> i.       For example, the sum of $1,500 listed by the Wife for the 2 children’s school fees.

>>> a)       The Wife testified that the Husband was currently paying for these expenses so she was estimating what she would have to pay after the hearing was concluded as she did not know the exact figure.

>>> b)       However, the Wife confirmed that the 2 children are both Singapore citizens[^8].

>>> c)       The Husband also put to her that based on current expenses for the son, the boy’s school fees were only at $85 per month (as a special needs child) and for the daughter, her school fees as a Secondary 3 student were at $15 per month, the total being $100 per month. The Wife did not dispute this[^9].

>> ii.       Regarding the sum of $500 for the 2 children’s transport expenses, the Wife also testified that she did not know the exact amount[^10] as these expenses were currently being paid by the Husband. When the Husband put to the Wife that the son’s transport expenses did not exceed $200 per month and the daughter’s transport expenses did not exceed $100 per month, the Wife’s only response was that the daughter’s transport expenses might be higher than $100 as sometimes the daughter had to take a taxi to school[^11].

>> iii.       The Wife also estimated that the 2 children’s enrichment/tuition expenses were at $1,500 per month for the daughter and at $260/$270 per month for the son for swimming lessons and other enrichment/tuition at about $450 per month[^12]. In my view, depending on the specific needs of the 2 children and the Husband’s financial capacity to pay, such expenses are “good to have items” but not essential for the monthly maintenance of the 2 children.

18     My assessment of the 2 children’s reasonable monthly expenses as compared to the Wife’s amounts at page 1 of Exhibit C was as follows:

19     My preliminary assessed total for the monthly expenses of both the Wife and the 2 children was therefore in the sum of $3,460 ($1,960 + $1,500). However, as the next step, before finalising the amount to be paid by the Husband, I was of the view that it was right and fair to assess the Husband’s financial capacity to pay.

20     The Husband testified that his Gross income as stated at page 2 of Exhibit R was $4,070 and his take home income also given at page 2 of Exhibit R was at $3,540 per month. The Husband produced his payslips to show that his take home salary for seven (7) months was between the sums of $3,478.50 to $3,716.20 excluding bonuses in December 2019 in Exhibit R[^13]. The Husband also informed that the status of all his savings accounts were as follows: (i) DBS at $12,857 (ii) POSB at $1,464 and (iii) UOB at $3,278[^14]. The Husband also testified that he had no other sources of income save for the balance of his Central Provident Fund (CPF) monies which was the sum of $40,000[^15] in his CPF Ordinary Account.

21     The Husband did not dispute the Wife’s claim that in previous years, he had initially paid the Wife between $6,300 to $7,000 as monthly maintenance for the Wife and the 2 children. The Husband also did not dispute that this monthly maintenance was later increased to $9,000 per month. However, from January 2020 until April 2020, the Husband had reduced the maintenance payment to $4,000 per month, as he could no longer afford to pay the Wife the previous monthly maintenance of $9,000.

22     The Husband’s testimony was that[^16]:

> a.     He had paid the previous monthly maintenance in the sum of $6,300 to $7,000 per month between 2005 to 2011, as he was then working in China and had a higher salary at that time of about $7,000 per month (after deduction of income tax);

> b.     The monthly maintenance was later increased to $9,000 per month even though his monthly income was still between $6,000 to $7,000 per month as he was using his savings to make up the difference;

> c.     He had paid for the increased monthly maintenance of $9,000 by surrendering his insurance policies in 2015, 2016 and 2017 and borrowing from family and friends;

> d.     When he came back from China in 2018, he continued to pay the sum of $9,000 maintenance to the Wife for the family’s maintenance even though he was unemployed for 3 months;

> e.     In November 2018, he had started to work again with the salary of $4,000 per month;

> f.     In the meanwhile, he had withdrawn the sum of $200,000 from his CPF and, after paying off his debts to his brother, friends and the bank amounting to $60,000, the balance left was about $140,000;

> g.     He had used this balance sum of $140,000 to pay for the monthly maintenance of $9,000 from 2018 until December 2019; and

> h.     The remaining sum left over from the balance sum of the $140,000 was about $40,000 which was what was now left in his CPF Ordinary Account[^17].

### Summary of the Court’s reasons for making its Orders

23     I took note that the Wife disputed the Husband’s testimony that he had borrowed money from family, friends and the bank. The Wife asserted that the Husband had been “leaving money with his friends and brother and never borrowed any money and that his financial status was strong”[^18]. However, the Wife failed to produce any evidence for these assertions.

24     I also noted that although it was not disputed that the younger child (the son) was a special needs child, the Wife did not produce any evidence to show what his monthly expenses were as a special needs child and only testified that the child needed special maintenance of about $2,000 per month[^19]. When I asked what these expenses were for the special needs of the son, the Wife admitted that she did not know this because the Husband was paying for these expenses[^20].

25     On the other hand, the Husband had produced documentary evidence to substantiate his testimony on his current income, status of his bank accounts and the balance sum in his CPF Ordinary Account. I also noted that under section 69 applications, the Wife had to show that the Husband had neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for her and the 2 children. In my view, the Wife had failed to do this.

26     I was also of the view that, based on the evidence produced before me for the hearing of this case, there was no evidence to show that the Husband had any income other than his take home salary of approximately $3,540 per month. In addition, I assessed that much of what the Wife was asking for were “good-to-haves” if there were available finances, but not essential monthly maintenance for the Wife’s and 2 children’s needs.

### Conclusion

27     In my final assessment, I took into account the Husband’s offer to pay the sum of $3,000 as monthly maintenance for the Wife and 2 children, based on his current earning capacity. The Husband had testified that at his current take home salary of approximately $3,540 per month, his offer of $3,000 was between 70% to 75% of his gross salary[^21]. I noted that the Husband’s offer of $3,000 as monthly maintenance to the Wife for herself and 2 children was between 80% to 85% of his current take home salary.

28     Upon consideration of all the facts produced at the hearing, I was of the view that the Husband’s proposed sum of $3,000 per month being $2,000 as maintenance for the Wife and $1,000 as maintenance for the 2 children, with both sums to be paid into the Wife’s bank account[^22], would give her flexibility on the use thereof. In my opinion, this was fair and reasonable for the maintenance of the Wife and the 2 children in an application for monthly maintenance under section 69 of the Women’s Charter. Hence, that was what I ordered.
