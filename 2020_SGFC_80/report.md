Civil Procedure – Costs

28 September 2020

### Assistant Registrar Tan Zhi Xiang:

## Introduction

1       The applicant acted for the respondent in divorce proceedings which have since concluded. As parties could not agree on the bill of costs, the applicant applied for the bill to be taxed. Having heard counsel, I taxed section 1 costs at $43,000 (down from $49,000), section 2 costs at $1,500 (down from $2,500) and section 3 costs at $2,500 (down from $3,254.20). The respondent, who took the position that section 1 costs should have been fixed at $8,000 instead, has applied for a review of my taxation order in relation to section 1 only.

2       As will be apparent below, I did not tax off section 1 costs more substantially because the respondent did not dispute the applicant’s key reasons for charging what appears at first blush to be a rather large sum. There was therefore limited _factual_ basis for me to arrive at a figure which was closer to what has been submitted. In my view, the Court cannot award cost just on the basis of how it _feels_; there must be legal or factual justification for its decision.

3       I also did not find the respondent’s approach, which was to take reference from costs typically incurred in matrimonial proceedings, to be helpful. It is trite that each case turns on its own facts and this is not any less true in taxation proceedings; regard must be had to the work done in a particular case. I will elaborate on these reasons below.

## Background facts

4       It is not necessary to set out in great detail the background leading up to the respondent’s divorce. For the purpose of these grounds, I will focus on work done by the applicant for the respondent.

5       These background facts, which I have gleaned from the bill of costs and applicant’s written submissions, was not disputed by the respondent in the notice of dispute, written submissions or at the hearing. Where appropriate, I also had regard to the Court’s own records, although I must emphasise that this was done only for matters which cannot possibly be disputed (such as the number of court attendances and orders made).

6       The applicant acted for the respondent for both the divorce proceedings and the ancillary matters. The respondent was the plaintiff husband in the said proceedings. The full suite of pleadings was filed: the writ, statement of claim, statement of particulars, defence and counterclaim and reply and defence to counterclaim.[^1]

7       Parties attended two mediation sessions, at the end of which it was agreed that the claim would proceed on an uncontested basis with the defendant (the respondent’s former wife) withdrawing the defence and counterclaim.[^2] Interim judgment was then granted.

8       Thereafter, the parties filed exchanged the affidavit of assets and means and the reply affidavits. The respondent applied for leave to file a further reply affidavit, and his application was allowed in part.[^3] The matter then proceeded to a half-day hearing, after which a District Judge made orders on the division of assets, which, by the time of the hearing, was the sole disputed issue in the ancillary matters.

9       In addition to the above hearings and mediation sessions, the respondent attended 12 case conferences, not including the one on 24 October 2017 which was vacated.[^4]

10     The proceedings lasted around 19 months, although most of the work was done within a span of 8 months.[^5] During this time, 59 emails were exchanged between the parties and between the respondent to the Court, while 135 emails were sent by the applicant to the respondent (consisting of “detailed and thorough reports verbatim” of court attendances). There were also four meetings with opposing counsel for the purpose of negotiating a settlement.[^6]

## Parties’ positions

### The applicant

11     The applicant submitted a bill for $54,752.20, comprising:

> (a)     Section 1: $49,000

> (b)     Section 2: $2,500

> (c)     Section 3: $3,254.20

12     The applicant’s main reasons for this rather steep bill were as follows:

> (a)     The respondent was advised of the legal fees involved for contentious proceedings which are billed on a “totally different scale”. He was aware and fully cognisant of this and he even consulted his mother. The respondent wanted to proceed with a contentious hearing because, in his own words, he “had come thus far” and “it defeats the purpose if \[he\] were to give in simply.”[^7]

> (b)     The respondent gave incomplete instructions which resulted in additional work done. Some examples include:

>> (i)       The respondent failed to disclose the fact that he had been incarcerated soon after his marriage until _after_ the affidavits of assets and means were exchanged. This meant that the respondent’s initial position on contributions to the marriage became difficult to justify.[^8]

>> (ii)       At mediation, the respondent could not furnish supporting documents to support his position of an equal division of the matrimonial flat.[^9]

>> (iii)       The respondent gave instructions on a downpayment which was flatly contradicted by documentary evidence from his former wife.[^10]

> In the applicant’s own words, “\[a\]s new facts kept emerging and the instructions from the \[respondent\] to explain and clarify facts became more elaborate, there was more paperwork created.”[^11] In addition, the belated disclosures dampened the prospects of settlement[^12] (which would presumably have saved costs).

> (c)     The respondent needed to be “handheld at every stage of the legal proceedings” to explain not just legalise but to be taken through word for word of every sentence of the respondent’s wife’s affidavit of assets and means and reply affidavit so that his detailed and through instructions could be taken.[^13] Further, urgent meetings were arranged with the respondent whenever any document was filed by his former wife, irrespective of office hours. There were also “lengthy” tele-conversations between the applicant and the respondent’s mother to explain any issues raised, directions made, or orders given that was unclear and/or to get a general feel and sense of the direction in which the respondent’s case was heading.[^14]

### The respondent

13     The respondent’s position was as follows:[^15]

> (a)     Section 1: $8,000

> (b)     Section 2: $1,000

> (c)     Section 3: $524.40

14     As I have stated above, the respondent did not dispute the applicant’s factual assertions of the work done, including what is set out at \[12\] above. The respondent’s submissions were as follows:

> (a)     The amount which the applicant was seeking was disproportionate to the complexity of the work, given that the sole ancillary issue which was disputed was the division of matrimonial assets.[^16]

> (b)     In relation to the first two tax invoices[^17] (which I understand were interim bills), the applicant was seeking costs which were greater what was invoiced.[^18]

> (c)     Counsel for the respondent also submitted at the hearing that the sums charged under the first two invoices were relatively small ($5,247.10[^19] and $3,119.40[^20]) and that the respondent was surprised with a third invoice ($31,557.50[^21]) which was for a much larger sum. However, it was not suggested that the applicant had misled the respondent by billing in this manner.

> (d)     In the summons for review of my taxation order, the respondent also stated that the number of hours which I had allowed for work done was too high given the nature and subject matter of the case.[^22]

## The law

15     The relevant provisions in the Family Justice Rules 2014 (S 813/2014) (“FJR”) provide:

> **Costs payable to solicitor by his own client**

> **879.—(1**)    This rule applies to every taxation of a solicitor’s bill of costs to his own client.

> (2)    Where this rule applies, costs shall be taxed on the indemnity basis but shall be presumed —

>> (a)    to have been reasonably incurred if they were incurred with the express or implied approval of the client;

>> (b)    to have been reasonable in amount if their amount was, expressly or impliedly, approved by the client; and

>> (c)    to have been unreasonably incurred if, in the circumstances of the case, they are of an unusual nature unless the solicitor satisfies the Registrar that prior to their being incurred the solicitor informed his client that they might not be allowed on a taxation of costs inter partes.

>> …

> (4)    The delivery of a bill of costs by a solicitor to his client shall not preclude the solicitor from presenting a bill for a larger amount or otherwise for taxation, if taxation is ordered by the Court or is consented to by the solicitor and his client.

> …

> **Provisions for ascertaining costs on taxation**

> **882.—(1**)    Subject to rules 850 to 881, the provisions in Part 1 of the Third Schedule for ascertaining the amount of costs to be allowed on a taxation of costs apply to the taxation of all costs with respect to contentious business.

> …

**THIRD SCHEDULE**

> …

> **Amount of costs**

> 1.—(1)    The amount of costs to be allowed shall (subject to any order of the Court) be at the discretion of the Registrar.

> (2)    In exercising his discretion, the Registrar must have regard to the principle of proportionality and all the relevant circumstances and, in particular, to the following matters:

>> (a)    the complexity of the item or of the cause or matter in which it arises and the difficulty or novelty of the questions involved;

>> (b)    the skill, specialised knowledge and responsibility required of, and the time and labour expended by, the solicitor;

>> (c)    the number and importance of the documents (however brief) prepared or perused;

>> (d)    the place and circumstances in which the business involved is transacted;

>> (e)    the urgency and importance of the cause or matter to the client;

>> (f)    where money or property is involved, its amount or value.

> 2.—(1)    The bill of costs must set out sufficient information that will enable the Registrar to have regard to the matters referred to in paragraph 1(2) and must comply with such requirements and contain such information as may be laid down or specified in any practice directions.

> (2)    Where attendances, telephone conversations and correspondence are concerned, it will be sufficient to state only the number of such attendances, telephone calls and correspondence, and, where possible, the total number of hours of such attendances and telephone calls.

> (3)    Where costs have already been awarded for any of the events set out, this fact and the amount awarded must be indicated.

> (4)    The bill must also contain a succinct narrative of the legal and factual issues involved.

> (5)    The bill may also contain the lists of authorities cited, indicating, where possible, those cited in the judgment of the Court.

> (6)    Work done in the cause or matter includes work done in connection with the negotiation of a settlement.

16     The test to be applied for taxation is one of reasonableness (_Singapore Civil Procedure 2018_ vol I (Foo Chee Hock gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 2018) (“_Singapore Civil Procedure_”) at para 59/27/1):

> In considering if a step is reasonable, the registrar considers whether a sensible solicitor considering what in the light of his then knowledge, was reasonable in the interests of his client. The client in question “should be deemed a man of means adequate to bear the expense of the litigation out of his own pocket – and by adequate I mean neither ‘barely adequate’ nor ‘super-abundant’”: _Francis v. Francis and Dickerson_ <span class="citation">\[1956\] P. 87</span> at 95; \[1955\] 3 All E.R. 836, approved in _Brush & Anor. v. Bower Cotton & Bower (a firm)_ \[1993\] 1 W.L.R.1328; \[1993\] 4 All E.R. 741 at 752.

17     As for what is meant by indemnity costs (see r 879(2) set out above), it is stated in _Singapore Civil Procedure_ at para 59/27/4:

> On a taxation of costs on the indemnity basis, all costs shall be allowed except in so far as they of an unreasonable amount or have been unreasonably incurred. Any doubts are to be resolved in favour of the receiving party.

## My decision

18     I will only explain my decision on section 1 costs as the review is limited to this particular item.

19     As I alluded to above, the key difficulty I had with the respondent’s case is that he did not dispute any of the facts which the applicant relied on to justify the quantum of costs sought for under section 1. Instead, the constant refrain from the respondent was that the only disputed issue in the ancillary matters was the division of matrimonial assets, and that having regard to the complexity of the matter, the bill could not be justified and must be substantially taxed off.

20     This was unhelpful because these were general and bare assertions. If the respondent had, for instance, stated and explained that some of the 135 emails sent by the applicant were unnecessary (see \[10\]), or that the applicant had spent unnecessary effort on issues that did not affect the outcome of the case, there might have been some basis for the Court to tax off section 1 costs. But there was no submission of this sort. Indeed, when queried at the hearing, counsel for the respondent did not deny that the respondent needed to be handheld throughout the divorce proceedings. It should be emphasised that under paragraph 1(2)(b) of the Third Schedule of the FJR, the time and labour expended by the applicant is a relevant factor in taxation. Hence, the respondent’s emphasis on the complexity of the matter, while relevant, does not address the entire picture. It was therefore difficult to justify any decision to tax off section 1 costs.

21     I also did not find it particularly helpful to have regard to what is awarded in a “typical” or “average” case. It cannot be emphasised enough that while norms and benchmarks may be of some relevance, they can be departed from if the facts so justify. In this case, the applicant had highlighted a number of factors which led to an increase in work done and time spent on the respondent’s divorce proceedings: see \[12\] and \[10\] above. At the risk of belabouring the point, these were not disputed by the respondent.

22     It is also relevant that the applicant was properly advised that the fees charged for contentious matters would be higher than fees charged for non-contentious matters: see \[12(a)\] above. In addition, it was not disputed that the parties entered into a “Repayment Agreement” on 7 August 2018,[^23] one day after the final bill of $31,557.50[^24] was issued, and after interim bills of $5,247.10[^25] and $3,119.40[^26] were previously issued. The validity of this “Repayment Agreement” was not challenged in the notice of dispute or elsewhere in these proceedings. These are pertinent because r 879(2)(a) states that costs are presumed “to have been reasonably incurred if they were incurred with the express or implied approval of the client”. The Repayment Agreement is, of course, not the approval itself, as it was entered into after costs were actually incurred. But it is evidence that there was likely at least implied approval.

23     This brings me to the two interim bills. Regarding the respondent’s point that the quantum that the applicant had sought for these interim bills in these taxation proceedings was higher than what was actually invoiced, the applicant indicated that those interim bills were invoiced on the basis of _uncontested_ proceedings.[^27] Since the proceedings became _contested_, and since the respondent agreed to being charged fees on the contentious scale, the amounts had to be revised the purpose of these taxation proceedings. Again, these underlying facts were not challenged by the respondent, in the notice of dispute or elsewhere. In any event, it is expressly stated in r 879(4):

> (4)    The delivery of a bill of costs by a solicitor to his client shall not preclude the solicitor from presenting a bill for a larger amount or otherwise for taxation, if taxation is ordered by the Court or is consented to by the solicitor and his client.

24     On the point that the respondent was “surprised” by a large final bill relative to the sums charged in the interim bills, it was not suggested that the applicant had misled the respondent with this billing pattern. Thus, in light of the discussion in the preceding paragraph, this cannot justify a reduction in section 1 costs.

25     I now turn to the applicant’s point that the number of hours which I had allowed for work done was too high given the nature and subject matter of the divorce proceedings. I should clarify that I did not accept the applicant’s case that she had done about 200 hours of work for the respondent.[^28] In my view, in light of the number of court attendances, the documents filed, and the numerous emails and correspondence between parties and the court, the applicant could not have done more than 100 hours of work (assuming that only a reasonable amount of time and effort was spent). The sum which I had allowed under section 1 ($43,000) is in line with this finding. Assuming the market rate for work done by a solicitor of 25 years’ standing to be around $350 to $500 (the applicant did not charge on an hourly basis but these were the applicant’s rather conservative estimates of the market rate),[^29] the figures translated to around 80 hours of work. This is in my judgment in line with the work done (which I have set out in detail above), which the respondent did not dispute.

26     I digress here briefly to make a point on the respondent’s conduct of these proceedings. He had submitted that the costs under section 1 should be no more than $8,000. This was plainly unrealistic considering the work done. In my view, it is incumbent on parties (and indeed counsel) to put forth positions which are realistic. The Court is not a market where parties bargain and negotiate. They cannot adopt extreme positions in the hope that the Court will reach a moderate outcome which is broadly consistent with what they both originally had in mind. If they do so, they would be of limited or even no assistance to the Court, and they run the risk that their submissions or positions would be disregarded.

27     Nevertheless, I did not fully accept the applicant’s reasons for claiming $49,000 under section 1. The applicant submitted:[^30]

> Even if the Respondent’s contention that the only outstanding matter was the division of the matrimonial property were to hold true, it is submitted that each and every factor applicable to the Respondent’s case under Section 112 (2) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353) was considered in great and thorough detail with 30-page written submissions filed, despite attempting to condense most of the information in the form of tables. It is further established that there is no expedited track for a consideration of such factors and one still has to go through the motion of considering each factor minutely in turn based on the actual factual matrix on a case-by-case basis.

28     It was not necessary for the applicant to apply each factor in s 112(2) in great detail. It is now trite that the Court adopts a broad-brush approach when determining the division of matrimonial assets. I thus found that more work was done than necessary and awarded $43,000 under section 1 instead of the $49,000 claimed the applicant. I emphasise that this point was not argued by the respondent but one which I considered on my own motion.

29     I should also point out that the respondent has paid about $16,000 to the applicant. Contrary to what his counsel appeared to suggest, this is not a basis for taxing off $16,000 under section 1 costs. However, as the applicant correctly accepted, the amount owing to her under the taxed bill is reduced accordingly.

## Conclusion

30     I accept that the section 1 costs sought by the applicant were on the high side. However, as I stated in the opening paragraphs of these grounds, the Court cannot award costs on the basis of what it “feels”, or on the ground that the quantum sought is greater than the “average” case. Each case must be decided on its own facts, and in this particular case, on the basis of work that was actually done. It is also incumbent on the respondent in taxation proceedings to challenge specific factual assertions in the bill of costs, instead of making general assertions that the bill is unreasonable. This is especially since where costs are taxed on an indemnity basis, any doubt as to the reasonableness of costs incurred is to be resolved in favour of the receiving party, _ie_, the applicant.

31     In light of the undisputed facts in relation to the work done by the applicant, I took the view that $43,000 was a fair sum for section 1 costs, and I so ordered.
