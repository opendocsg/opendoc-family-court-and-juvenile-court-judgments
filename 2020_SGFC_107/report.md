FAMILY LAW – Variation of ancillary matters – s128 &129 of Women’s Charter

16 December 2020

### District Judge Cheryl Koh:

## A.   Introduction

1       There are 4 Summonses in this case:

> (a)     Summons No. 2409/2018 is an application by the defendant father (the “**Father**”) and Summons No. 2436/2018 is an application by the plaintiff mother (the “**Mother**”) to vary the Interim Judgment (the “**IJ**”), in relation to custody, care and control and access to the one child of the marriage (the “**Child**”);

> (b)     Summons No. 244/2019 is the Mother’s application to vary the Interim Judgment in relation to maintenance of the Child; and

> (c)     Summons No. 3836/2019 is the Mother’s application to vary the Interim Judgment, so as to have the sole authority to decide on Singapore permanent residency (“**PR**”) for the Child.

2       Four main issues arise in this case:

> (a)     on the issue of the Father’s access to the Child, both parties were prepared to work with a child psychologist (“**CP**”) for the management of the Father’s access to the Child, as well as for therapeutic individual and family intervention. However, they disagreed on the choice of the CP. I ordered for parties to work with a CP who is to be jointly appointed by both parties;

> (b)     in relation to the Child’s Singapore PR, I granted the Mother the sole discretion to make a single application for Singapore PR for the Child, without the Father’s consent;

> (c)     as for the Child’s travel with the Mother, I removed the requirement for the Mother to obtain the Father’s consent, and allowed her to travel with the Child during the first half of the Child’s mid and year end school holidays; and

> (d)     as for the Child’s maintenance, I declined to increase any maintenance for the Child.

3       The Father has appealed against all of my decisions, save in relation to the Child’s maintenance. There is no appeal by the Mother.

## B.   Background facts

4       Parties are Sri Lankan citizens and were married in Sri Lanka on 10 April 2007. Parties came to Singapore shortly after marriage. The Child was born in 2009 and is about 11 years old. Parties filed for an uncontested divorce in 2016. Interim Judgment was granted on 11 October 2016 with Final Judgment issued on 17 January 2017. The Mother resides in Singapore with the Child and is a head of psychiatry in a hospital. Since 2016, the Father returned to Sri Lanka where he now resides and is self-employed.

5       The IJ provided that parties shall have joint custody of the Child with care and control to the Mother and reasonable access to the Father on a schedule to be mutually agreed upon by parties. On overseas access, the Father may travel overseas with the Child during the times he has the Child, provided advance notice is given to the Mother and the Mother consents to such overseas access. The Father also had school holiday, religious holidays and special occasions access to be mutually agreed upon by parties. The Mother is also required to give the Father a minimum of one (1) month’s advanced notice and obtain the Father’s consent prior to travelling overseas with the Child.

6       By way of Summons 2409/2018, the Father sought to vary the IJ to have joint care and control of the Child, access for half of school holidays and alternate religious holidays and special occasions, overseas travel during access and phone access. The Father also sought for parties to undergo a psychiatric evaluation.

7       By way of Summons 2438/2018 and 244/2019, the Mother sought to vary the IJ to have sole custody of the Child or alternatively, joint custody with the Mother making final decisions on the Child’s travel and Singapore PR status. She also sought for the Father to have supervised access to the Child with an appropriate adult (which could be a medical professional), reasonable remote access with advance notice, annual review of access with a view to providing progressive unsupervised access, and the release of the Child’s passport to the Mother.

8       At a Case Conference, parties agreed to jointly appoint a CP (the “**Appointed CP**”) who issued a report dated 30 October 2018 (the “**1st report**”) and a second report dated 24 October 2019 (the “**2nd report**”). The CP also issued a letter dated 20 December 2019 in response to certain questions posed to her by parties.

9       A summary of the 1st report findings is as follows:

> (a)      _“\[The Child\] should continue to stay with his mother. His mother has given him the most confidence to face situations and she continues to give him courage to face his father despite the unsettling experiences he has had with his father_”;

> (b)     “_it is observed that his father’s unhappiness with \[the Child’s\] mother is clearly affecting his relationship with his son. This poses as a major issue as it clouds his judgment and approach with \[the Child\]”;_

> (c)      _“\[the Child\] should still maintain consistent contact with his father, however, another approved adult needs to be present as \[the Child\] had verbalized being unsafe being alone with his father_”;

> (d)     “_his father should receive therapy to process his anger towards \[the Child’s\] mother_”;

> (e)     “_his father should receive therapy to learn how to co-parent effectively_”; and

> (f)     “_both parents to refrain from using \[the Child\] as an instrument in the divorce as \[the Child\] is feeling the strain from the process. He is encouraged to receive therapy to work through his conflicts and confusion that he is facing currently_” (words in square brackets replaced).

10     Following the 1st report, I ordered a further 8 sessions of supervised access with the Appointed CP. On 15 July 2019, the Father’s solicitors sent the Appointed CP a letter alleging _inter alia_ that the Child has been manipulated, coached and indoctrinated by the Mother and the Appointed CP should explain the impact of such interference to the Court. A 2nd report was issued by her on 24 October 2019 noting that the Child did not want to see the Father anymore and recommending that:

> (a)     the Mother is to receive counselling and appropriate support for her trauma that she has experienced;

> (b)     the Child is to continue counselling consistently;

> (c)     the Father to receive therapy to process anger towards the Mother;

> (d)     both parties to refrain from using the Child as an instrument in the divorce; and

> (e)     both parents encouraged to participate in the events of the Child’s life, but subjected to the comfort level of the Child.

11     Parties were directed at a Case Conference to seek clarification from the Appointed CP, including as to how the Father may interact with the Child, i.e., would the Appointed CP facilitate the interaction or would the Father have his own interaction with the Child outside therapy. Parties also queried if the Appointed CP was able and willing to be appointed as the therapist. The Appointed CP responded on 20 October 2019:

> “_The Father is eager to participate in the child’s life. He should be given equal opportunity to be made aware of his child’s school events and to go for his child’s school events. There is no indication that the child is in physical danger in the presence of his father. A junior therapist can be present outside of therapy sessions if all parties (including the child) are agreeable.”_

> _“The appointed therapist should be agreed by all parties.”_

12     Parties filed the following affidavits in the various Summons applications:

> (a)     the Father’s affidavits filed on 9 July 2018, 15 February 2019 11 March 2019, 26 March 2019 and 28 January 2020; and

> (b)     the Mother’s affidavits filed on 11 July 2018, 21 January 2018, 15 February 2019, 7 March 2019, 26 March 2019, 16 May 2019, 1 November 2019 and 30 January 2020.

13     I will deal with each of the following three disputed issues in turn:

> (a)     first, on the choice of an appointed CP;

> (b)     second, on the Child’s Singapore PR; and

> (c)     third, on the Child’s travel with the Mother.

## C.   Grounds of Decision

### The appointment of a CP

14     Parties are prepared to abide by the Appointed CP’s recommendations in the 2nd Report.[^2] The Appointed CP specifically recommended therapy and counselling for parties and the Child. In the meantime, she opined that any time spent with the Father should be “_subjected to the comfort level of the Child_” and a “_junior therapist can be present outside of therapy sessions if all parties (including the child) are agreeable_.” Parties however disagreed with the choice of the CP. The Mother believed that the Appointed CP has been affected by the Father’s conduct after the 1st report, when he wrote to her through his solicitors on 15 July 2019: see \[10\] above. She believed this led to the issuance of an evasive and less detailed 2nd Report. The Father’s position is that he would continue to work with the Appointed CP, who he felt was now non-partisan after the 2nd report.

15     The Court does not have the power to order a party to engage in individual, family or reunification therapy with a CP, the choice of whom the party disagreed with. There is no existing legislation which specifically empowered the Court to do so. It may be counterproductive to therapy to force the Mother to work with an unwanted CP. The appointment of the Appointed CP was predicated on parties’ agreement, and her continued appointment would naturally require the same agreement. The Appointed CP herself expressed the view that “_the appointed therapist should be agreed by all parties_.” Additionally, the Court has through its counsellors from the Counselling and Psychological Services (CAPs) further clarified with the Appointed CP who expressed reservations on the case given the Mother’s objections. The Court’s CAPs counsellors have also searched for another CP who would be willing to be appointed for this case, so that parties would not be left in the lurch as to who else they may appoint as a suitable CP. In these circumstances, I made it clear in my orders set out in \[27\] herein that the choice of appointment of a CP should be predicated on both parties’ agreement.

### The Child’s Singapore PR

16     Parties had agreed to joint custody of the Child in the IJ, which meant that they should agree on major issues concerning the Child. Nonetheless, I found it in the best interests of the Child to vary the IJ to give the Mother the sole authority to make a single application to the relevant authorities for Singapore PR for the Child, without the Father’s consent, for the following reasons.

17      _Fir_st, the Father disagreed with Singapore PR as he felt it would be a precursor to the Mother’s plan to force Singapore citizenship unto the Child, and he wished for the Child to remain a Sri Lankan citizen until he is of age to make a decision himself[^3]. He hoped that the Child would return to Sri Lanka one day to takeover management of the family’s business[^4]. This is not however a valid concern, as even if the Child obtained Singapore PR, he could remain a Sri Lankan citizen. The Mother has not been given any authority to apply for Singapore citizenship for the Child, without the Father’s consent.

18      _Second_, the Child was born in Singapore and has lived in Singapore his whole life. The Child had never lived anywhere else and had only ever visited Sri Lanka on 3 occasions, when he was 3 months old, 1.5 years old and 6 years old. The Child is currently on a dependant’s pass in Singapore and is not entitled to educational and medical benefits as a foreigner. Parties had tried applying for Singapore PR as a family in 2011 but were rejected. They tried again in 2014 but were again rejected. Even after parties were divorced, the Father offered the Mother assistance in a third application for herself and the Child by recommending agents[^5]. Now that the marriage has broken down and the Father has returned to Sri Lanka since around 2016, it did not automatically mean that the Mother and the Child should cease in their attempts for Singapore PR.

19      _Third_, I considered that the Mother has built her career in Singapore since 2007 and intended to continue to reside in Singapore with the Child. If she remained a foreigner, her career progression may be limited and she would not receive CPF contributions. She has tried to apply for Singapore PR for herself and the Child in 2016 and 2019 without the Father’s consent, but both applications failed. Her evidence is that if she did not have sole custody of the Child or a court order stating that she has authority to decide on Singapore PR for the Child without the Father’s consent, she is unlikely able to obtain Singapore PR for the Child. She may then only be able to obtain Singapore PR for herself. In that situation, the Child’s dependant pass would be converted to a student’s pass. The Child would then be forced to leave his current school as his school does not accept students holding a student pass[^6].

20      _Finally_, I did not grant the Mother unfettered discretion to make unlimited applications for Singapore PR for the Child. Instead, I permitted a single application to be made by the Mother for the Child. It is not meant to be a guarantee that the Child would obtain Singapore PR. If the Mother failed to obtain Singapore PR in this application, she would need to seek the Father’s consent for any further applications or obtain a further court order, as circumstances might be different then.

### The Child’s travel with the Mother

21     Pursuant to the IJ, the Mother is required to give the Father a minimum of one (1) month’s advanced notice and obtain the Father’s consent prior to travelling overseas with the Child. This has posed difficulties for the Mother’s travel with the Child. I found it in the best interests of the Child to vary the IJ to allow the Mother to travel with the Child during the first half of mid and year end school holidays.

22      _First_, in relation to a Bintan trip for the Mother and the Child from 3 to 5 March 2019, the Father had consented to the trip but did not consent to the release of the Child’s passport to the Mother despite repeated reminders. The Child’s passport had been kept with the Mother’s solicitors as a condition for the Father’s consent to the renewal of the Child’s passport. As such, two days before the intended departure, the Mother had to cancel the trip.

23      _Second_, the Mother had wanted to bring the Child to Sri Lanka from 17 to 24 July 2019 to attend her sister’s wedding. Her sister was the Child’s godmother and the Child was to be the ringbearer for the ceremony. They were to reside in Marino Beach Hotel, Colombo. The Father objected to the trip on the basis there was dengue in Sri Lanka. On 18 April 2019, I gave the Mother permission to travel with the Child to Sri Lanka, as I found it unreasonable for the Father to withhold consent for the Mother and the Child to attend a family wedding back home. On appeal, the Father assured the High Court he would allow the Mother and the Child to travel to Sri Lanka in September 2019 instead. However, the Child again could not travel to Sri Lanka in September 2019, as the Father refused consent unless his family members also had access to the Child then.

24      _Third_, the Mother requested for the Father’s consent for the Child to go for his school trip to Sibu from 28 to 30 August 2019. The Father responded that the Child could go on the trip provided the Mother provided copies of all the passport pages of the Child’s old and new passport (in a bid to investigate if the Mother had secretly brought the Child out of Singapore without his consent). The Mother eventually provided copies of the Child’s passport so that the Child could go on his school trip.

25      _Fourth_, the Mother requested for the Father’s consent to travel with the Child to Bali from 26 to 31 December 2019. The Father’s response was that he and his father would like to meet the Child when they travelled to Singapore. The Father did not even respond on the Mother’s request to travel to Bali. As such, the Mother did not get to travel with the Child for most of 2019.

26     It thus appeared that the Father used the requirement for his consent for the Mother’s travel with the Child as a bargaining chip to obtain his own access to the Child, but these are two separate issues that should not be tied together. The Father’s relationship with the Child is something that has to be worked on and managed by the CP with therapy. It did not however mean that if the Father could not have access to the Child on his terms, he should as punishment then deny consent for the Mother to travel with the Child. As such, I find it in the best interests of the Child for the Mother to be able to travel with the Child during the Child’s first half of mid and year end school holidays, without the Father’s consent. For the second half of school holidays, the Child would remain in Singapore so that it would be possible for the Father to visit him here. All other travel with the Child remained subject to the Father’s consent. The Child’s passport should not be kept with the Mother’s solicitors indefinitely after its renewal, but instead be released back to the Mother.

## D.   Conclusion

27     In these circumstances, I made the following orders herein:

> 1.    Paragraph 3a. of the Interim Judgment be varied as follows:

>> a.    That the Plaintiff and the Defendant shall continue to have joint custody of the Child of the marriage, namely, XXX, save that:

Any future or repeated application will require the Defendant’s consent or a further Order of Court; and

>>> (ii)   The Plaintiff shall have sole discretion to apply for any overseas travel visas for the Child from the relevant authorities without the Defendant’s consent, for the Child’s travel with the Plaintiff, pursuant to paragraph 3(g) of the Interim Judgment (as varied by paragraph 3 of this Order of Court).

Costs of the Defendant’s supervised access shall be shared equally between parties.

>> (b)    Both parties and the Child are to attend individual and/or joint counselling sessions, as well as individual and/or reunification therapy sessions, as may be mutually agreed between the private psychologist and each of the parties, but for at least one session a month for each of the parties and the Child of at least one hour per session. Each party shall bear the costs of their individual sessions with the private psychologist, and any sessions involving both parties and/or the Child shall be shared equally.

>> (c)    A report shall be prepared by the private psychologist for the Court with regard to the various sessions held with parties and the Child, in the event that a report is required for use in Court proceedings. The report will be open to parties. No Court review is required in the meantime.

>> (d)    The Defendant shall have additional access to the Child via WhatsApp/Facetime/Skype or other electronic or voice over internet protocol means access for at least half an hour every Sunday evening.

>> (e)    The Plaintiff is to keep the Defendant informed of all major school events pertaining to the Child (such as Meet the Parents sessions, school performances by the Child) and the Defendant is at liberty to attend the same.
