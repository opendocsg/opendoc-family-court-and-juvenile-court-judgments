Interim Spousal Maintenance – s69 Women’s Charter

29 April 2020

### District Judge Goh Zhuo Neng:

## A.   INTRODUCTION

1       In MSS3259 of 2019, the Complainant Wife (“**Wife**”) sought orders for the Respondent Husband (“**Husband**”) to pay her spousal maintenance of $600.00 per month. Parties lived apart but were still married.

2       After hearing parties on 30 January 2020, I ordered that the Husband would pay the Wife maintenance of $260.00 a month starting from 15 February 2020 and thereafter on the 15th day of each month with payments into her designated account.

3       On 5 February 2020, the Husband filed an appeal against my decision. The full grounds of my decision are set out below.

## B.   THE LAW

4       Under Section 69 of the Women’s Charter (Cap.353) (“**Charter**”), the Court may order a husband to pay maintenance for a wife if it has been proved that he had neglected to do so.

5       In determining the amount of maintenance payable to the wife in such a case, Section 69(4) of the Charter provides some of the following factors that the Court can take into account:

> a)     The financial needs of the Wife.

> b)     The Wife’s income and earning capacity.

> c)     The age of each party to the marriage.

> d)     The standard of living enjoyed by the Wife before the Husband refused to provide reasonable maintenance for her.

6       Section 69(1) is to provide the wife with “_modest maintenance_”, namely to help her overcome her immediate financial need, “_which may well be the same objective when ordering maintenance for a dependant child.”_ See _Foo Ah Yan v Chiam Heng Chow_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 2 SLR 506</span>.

7       Maintenance for the spouse in this case is like a “_tide over sum_” to tide the wife over until the final hearing when ancillary matters are resolved. See _AXM v AXO_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 705</span> at \[16\], applied by _TEM v TEN_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGDC 238</span>, at \[20\].

## C.   APPLICATION OF THE LAW TO THE FACTS

### I.    What Was The Declared Income of the Parties?

8       The Husband was an odd job labourer with a declared income of $700.00 at the hearing. He also received $392.00 a month from his Central Provident Fund’s retirement account, with a total monthly income of $1,092.00.

9       The Wife worked part time in a restaurant. Her salary slips from May 2019 to October 2019 indicated that she earned $635.00 nett. This was also confirmed by a letter from her employer dated 20 November 2019. At the hearing, she claimed that she would not be able to work anymore from 3 February 2020 as she would be taking care of her grandchild. She explained at the hearing that she was presently paid on an hourly basis at $9.00 an hour and worked 5 hours a day, 3 times a week – which reflected a monthly income of about $540.00. This was not challenged by the Husband.

### II.    What Maintenance Did the Husband Provide to the Wife Previously?

10     At the hearing, the Wife claimed that she had previously worked at a canteen during the marriage, and that the Husband had paid her maintenance of about $400.00 a month. This was not challenged by the Husband.

11     At the hearing, the Wife submitted that the Husband had stopped paying her maintenance since May 2019. This was not challenged by the Husband.

### III.    What are the Wife’s Reasonable Expenses that the Husband should pay?

12     The Wife claimed that her reasonable monthly expenses amounted to $820.00, which were not challenged by the Husband. I found however that the amounts incurred for food were not adequately substantiated and rounded her reasonable expenses down to $800.00.

13     The Husband explained that he should not be required to pay the Wife’s expenses, as his salary was far exceeded by expenses of about **$1,412.00.**

14     The Husband’s rental expenses were challenged by the Wife in cross-examination. The Husband explained in cross-examination that he was currently staying in his sister’s flat in return for rent. In support of this, he relied on a tenancy agreement dated 4 November 2019 that he had entered into with his sister. It stated that the Husband would pay the sum of $600.00 a month to his sister to rent a room for 6 months.

15     However, the Husband’s bank statements did not indicate that he was making this monthly payment to his sister. There were no withdrawals or transfers for an equivalent sum. He admitted on the stand that he would pay his sister when he could.

16     In the circumstances, I found that the Husband’s tenancy agreement with his sister was a sham, and he was not actually paying her any rental for the use of the room. This would reduce his monthly expenses to $812.00.

17     Having made this finding, I ordered that the Husband pay the Wife a monthly maintenance of $260.00 into the Wife’s designated bank account under POSB No. XXX. Payment of maintenance would be made on the 15th day of each month, starting from 15 February 2020. This was for the following reasons:

> (a)     With the removal of the rental expenses of $600.00, the Husband’s reasonable expenses were now $812.00.

> (b)     The expenses of $812.00 gave the Husband a surplus of $280.00 a month from his monthly income of $1,092.00.

> (c)     This surplus of $280.00 was sufficient to cover the Mother’s monthly expenses of $800.00. She would continue to work, earning $540.00 a month, and the remaining expenses of $260.00 a month would be covered by the maintenance paid by the Husband.

## D. Conclusion

18     For the reasons stated above, I granted the Wife’s application for maintenance.
