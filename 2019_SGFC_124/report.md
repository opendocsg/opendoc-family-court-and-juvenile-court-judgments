Relocation, Best interests of children

15 November 2019

### District Judge Jen Koh:

## Background

1       The Plaintiff is referred to as the “Mother” and the Defendant is referred to as the “Father”. The parties were married in Singapore in November 2000 and have three children, a daughter who is 15 years old, a 13 year old son and a younger daughter who is 11 (“the Children”). The Mother and the Children are Singapore citizens. The Father was originally from El Salvador but is now a Singapore citizen. The Children have lived in Singapore their entire lives.

2       The Mother sought a divorce in June 2011. The interim judgment was granted on 24 October 2011 and the final judgment of divorce was granted on 17 February 2014. With the interim judgment, the parties reached, inter alia, a consent order which read:

> _“Each party may relocate from Singapore. The Child may be absent from Singapore either with prior written consent from both parties or on the terms of an Order of Court”._

3       The Mother remarried her current husband, an American citizen, on xxx April 2019. One month later, in May 2019, the Mother filed her application to relocate to the United States of America (the USA) with the Children. She hoped to relocate in September 2019. The Father objected to the relocation.

4       The application first came on for hearing on 30 July 2019. The Mother sought leave to file a further affidavit after I raised certain queries about her case. The matter came on for further hearing on 19 August 2019. The Mother indicated that plans for relocation were no longer urgent and had been postponed to early 2020 instead of September 2019. A final hearing was fixed for 20 September 2019. I dismissed the application on 20 September 2019 leading to the present appeal by the Mother.

## The Mother’s reasons for relocation

5       In her supporting affidavit, the Mother said that she wished to relocate for work and personal reasons and that the relocation would be in the best interests of the Children.

6       She said that the Father had been absent from the Children’s lives and maintained a distant relationship with them thereby allowing her husband to assume the role of a father to the Children. The Father had likewise remarried and has two children. The Mother said that the Father’s wife does not have a close relationship with the Children.

7       The Children would not be relocating _en masse;_ the Mother intended to relocate with the 2 younger Children (originally in September 2019) and to leave the oldest Child with her parents in Singapore until the 1st Child completed her GCE ‘O’ levels in 2020. The Mother said that she had identified a school for the 2nd and 3rd Child and that an email had been sent to the school.

8       A particular aspect of this case (although the decision did not turn on it solely) was the eldest Child’s involvement in the Taekwondo National Team in Singapore. The 1st Child is likely to be participating in the 2021 SEA Games in Hanoi, Vietnam and the Mother said that she would be receiving world class training and support from the gyms in the USA.

9       Because of the dearth of information in the Mother’s supporting affidavit, she was directed to file a second affidavit addressing the Court’s queries. The Mother filed a further affidavit and in this affidavit she elaborated:

> (a)     The Children’s living arrangement upon relocation and her intention to be a stay home mum for a couple of years.

> (b)     That her husband and she were in the process of applying for Green Card status for the Children. The application was not exhibited. She said that she had hoped the visa application would have come through by September 2019 but it did not and as such the 2 younger Children would now complete their respective academic years in Singapore before starting school in the USA at the beginning of 2020. Plans for the 1st Child remained unchanged.

> (c)     For the 1st Child, she said that it was the said Child’s personal ambition to complete her ‘O’ levels before relocating. She also identified suitable gyms for the Children especially the 1st Child to continue to pursue their Taekwondo ambitions.

> (d)     As for the son’s National Service obligations, she said there was no doubt that the 2nd Child would return to fulfil his obligations and that there was no issue with her and her husband putting up the bond of $75,000.

> (e)     She elaborated on the academic plan she had in mind for the 2nd and 3rd Child in the school referred to in the supporting affidavit but with the 1st and 2nd Child then going into another school in September end 2020 when the 1st Child joined the family in the USA.

> (f)     She spoke about the husband’s employment and the fact that he was first seconded to Singapore in July 2016 but that the contract expired. She said that he was unable to find something similar in the oil and gas industry in Singapore and he then returned to the USA when his employment pass expired. She said they dated about a year before they married in April 2019.

## The Father’s reasons for objecting to relocation

10     The Father objected to the application and raised the following concerns/issues:

> (a)     That the relocation would not be in the Children’s best interests.

> (b)     In particular, the Children should not be separated. He raised concern about the 1st Child being left behind and the Mother’s desire for the said 1st Child to assert her independence. He also asked how the 1st Child’s ambition in the National Taekwondo Squad could be realised in the USA.

> (c)     He said that he was experiencing issues with access and that the Mother intended to exclude him from the Children’s lives with the relocation.

> (d)     He raised issues with the disruption to the Children’s lives because they have lived in Singapore all their lives. In particular, he raised concerns about the 2nd Child’s National Service obligations and the Children’s education in general because of the different academic curriculums.

> (e)     The Mother’s relationship with her husband is relatively young and he raised concerns about the dependence on the husband and the husband taking on 3 children from another marriage.

> (f)     That the status of the Children’s stay in the USA seemed amorphous; it appeared that the visa the Mother was applying for was one for conditional residency and this created another layer of uncertainty for the Children.

## A summary of the Mother’s position

11     The driving reason for the Mother’s application would appear to be the remarriage and the husband’s inability to remain in Singapore with the expiry of his contract. As the Mother has care and control of the Children, she has thus made plans for the Children to relocate with her including sorting out their schooling and accommodation. The Mother’s wish to relocate could not be said to be one in which she sought to deprive the Father of contact with the Children, but arose out of her desire to move on to the next stage of her life and her relationship with her husband in his home country. As she has care and control of the Children, naturally she desired to relocate with them as well and to start the next phase of life after her remarriage.

12     This was also not a case in which the Mother’s well-being would be tied to relocation such that a denial thereof would have an adverse and negative impact on the Children.

13     An examination of the facts showed that there was no suggestion that the relocation was motivated by the Children having any particular educational needs that required options not available in Singapore. The Mother referred to the 2nd Child having a mild form of dyslexia but this was not known to the Father who learnt of this in the Mother’s affidavits filed in support of her application. The Mother said that the proposed school in the USA had a structured support system for students with learning disabilities and this would cater to the 2nd Child’s needs.

14     The Mother was cognizant of the 2nd Child’s National Service obligations and committed to having the son return to Singapore to fulfil this obligation. She also committed to paying the bond required for the 2nd Child to leave the jurisdiction of Singapore.

15     The Mother had also shared her relocation plan and took into account the separation of the Children for about a year before the family would be together.

## Court’s findings and decision

16     Against the backdrop of both parties’ wishes, I considered the law in this area and applied prevailing principles to the facts of this case.

## Legal principles

17     The law is trite and I refer in particular, to the case of _BNS v BNT_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 973</span> (BNS). In the decision, the Court of Appeal (CA) held that there was only one fundamental legal principle upon which the ultimate decision of the Court depended: in considering relocation applications, the welfare of the child was paramount and this principle ought to override any other consideration.

18     The CA went on to say it would also consider:

> (a)     whether the relocating parent’s wish to relocate was reasonable and an important factor affecting the child’s welfare – this pertained to a possible transference of the relocating parent’s insecurity and negative feelings onto the child;

> (b)     even if it was a reasonable wish to relocate, this was no more than a factor to be weighed in the overarching inquiry into the child’s welfare and not a single determinative factor to trump all other relevant considerations, and

> (c)     the loss of relationship with the left-behind parent as it is axiomatic that a child benefitted from the nurturing presence and joint contributions of both parents but even then the CA said it would consider how adversely the loss would impact the child’s welfare and this is dependent on the facts as well as the strength of the existing bond between the left-behind parent and the child.

## Applying the legal principles to the facts of this case

19     After reviewing the evidence, I considered the following matters (in no particular order of importance).

#### Uncertainty about residency

20     I had at the earlier hearing, raised concerns that the Mother had not addressed the issue of residency for the Children and herself in the USA. She then filed her second affidavit in which she claimed that her husband and herself would be applying for Green Cards for the Children. She did not address the issue raised by the Father that the visa she had applied for was one for a conditional stay. She gave no information as to how the Children would reside in and stay on in the USA pending the issuance of Green Cards.

21     I was also concerned that the application seemed prompted by my questions at the last hearing. The Mother made no mention of how the Children would stay on in the USA in her supporting affidavit. There were no supporting documents and no elaboration of the process save for an averment in her affidavit that the Mother and her husband were ‘currently in the process’ of the application.

22     Relocation is a serious process and the impact in particular on the Children’s lives would be major. The Mother did not appear to have conducted the necessary due diligence and/or prepared for the move. Surely it should not be for the Court to prompt the questions and to raise the concerns. These should have been matters upfront in the Mother’s mind seeing as to how the issues would directly impact the Children.

#### Living arrangements in the USA

23     The Mother had not previously informed or disclosed whether she would continue to work in the USA and how the children would be supported by her husband and/or their living expenses in the USA. She did not also address the issue of the current maintenance being paid by the Father and how this issue was to be dealt with relocation if allowed. In her second affidavit, she then said she would be a stay-home mum for the next 3 years. She also stated that there would be privileges accorded to the Children. However, there was no clarity as to what these privileges were and whether they would be subject to the Children’s residency status. It was not clear under what circumstances the Children would enter the USA and the Mother did not clarify the issue. This would surely have an impact on the privileges they would be accorded.

24     According to the Mother, the Children and she would also be totally dependent on her husband. The relationship was about a year old before the Mother remarried in April 2019. She then filed the relocation application a month later in May 2019. The Father had some views on this given the newness of the marriage and the young relationship. The Mother would be relocating to a new country in a different continent with a relatively new relationship and she proposed that the Children and her to be wholly dependent on the husband. However, other than the Mother’s assertions that the husband had a good relationship with the Children, there was nothing before the Court as to the nature of that relationship whether an affidavit by her husband or photographs of the Children and her husband together etc. The husband himself was silent throughout the proceedings and whilst he may not want to get involved in the legal fray between the Mother and the Father, the fact of the matter was that he was inviting these Children into his home in Texas, Houston and he was also proposing to support them financially as well as sponsoring their stay in the USA. He would also be assisting to pay the 2nd Child’s bond of $75,000 (discussed below). According to the Mother, plans were underway to remodel his home to create the bedrooms required for all the Children. It would have afforded some reassurance if he had addressed the Court on the matters stated by the Mother in a direct manner.

25     There was a lack of relevant information as to when the application was filed. The second affidavit was prompted by the Court who raised issues such as the living arrangements, care plan etc. It beget the question as to whether the Mother could have planned the relocation better eg remodelling the home _first_ and providing photographs which would have provided more insight into the Children’s proposed future home.

#### The 2nd Child’s National Service obligations

26     The Mother did not address this obligation in her supporting affidavit. Again, it was only when prompted that the Mother addressed the 2nd Child’s National Service obligations by stating that they (the Mother and her husband) would pay the bond for the 2nd Child to leave Singapore. Given that the original date for relocation was “as soon as possible”, the Mother certainly did not produce supporting documents as to the Central ManPower Base’s (CMPB) consent to the 2nd Child leaving the jurisdiction with a valid exit permit nor evidence that the Mother had so applied as well as the documents evidencing payment of the security bond.

27     The Father had no knowledge of this and this was an issue for concern considering that as the joint custodial parent he was not consulted or was kept in the dark with regard the Mother’s discussions, if any, with the CMPB.

28     The gap in the Mother’s evidence on this issue was a matter of some concern as any failure to comply would have an impact on the 2nd Child’s future.

#### Schooling for the Children

29     The Mother did not previously confirmed schooling for the Children. Other than an email that she said she sent to her choice of school for the 2nd and 3rd Child, there was no follow up and no indication as to placements. In reply, the Mother said she would have gotten confirmation once relocation was permitted.

30     I disagreed with the position taken by her. In relocation applications, the relocating parent has a relocation plan which is fairly detailed although there are allowances for some changes with regard to schools, dates of departures etc. In this case, the Mother only sought the details requested after the Court queried the lack of information. It was only in August 2019 that she confirmed placement in the selected school for the 2nd and 3rd Child.

31     In her supporting affidavit, there was also no write up about the school curriculum, the grades the Children would be starting in, the subjects and their possible assimilation into the education programmes in the USA (as the school system is drastically different from the local schools where the 2 younger children currently study in). The Father had rightly voiced his concerns given that the 2 local schools are fairly ‘prestigious’ schools and the Children have been in the schools for years.

32     On top of this lack of certainty, the Mother then said that the 2nd Child has mild dyslexia, a fact not previously known to the Father. The Father was rightly alarmed and even more so as no details were forthcoming. The Mother then said that the proposed school had a programme which would assist the 2nd Child as the school had a structured programme for students with learning disabilities. However, it beget the question as to how the 2nd Child was currently being supported in his current school in Singapore as there did not seem to be an indication as to poorness of academic results as a consequence of this mild dyslexia. If the 2nd Child did have mild dyslexia, then a further concern would be how he could cope with the change in country, in school and in curriculum _and_ the Mother’s suggestion that he switched to another language as a second language.

33     The Mother filed a second affidavit with regard the schooling issue but this again afforded little comfort. The 2nd and 3rd Child would attend the same school until September 2020 when the 2nd Child would then move to attend High School with the 1st Child. Bearing in mind the issue of the 2nd Child’s mild dyslexia, I was concerned about the switch of schools within a year for this 2nd Child.

#### Children will be separated

34     Of particular concern was the fact that the Mother decided that the 3 Children were to be separated and relocated at different timeframes. The Mother had decided that the 1st Child would remain in Singapore to complete her GCE ‘O’ levels as this was a personal challenge (for the 1st Child) and that the 1st Child herself wanted to complete this examination. The next year (2020) would be an important year for this Child and the Mother certainly thought so as well and said so in her affidavit. That being the case, I was concerned at a decision to leave the 1st Child with her maternal grandparents who hitherto did not have care of her. I would have thought it would be even more imperative for the Mother to stay in Singapore to support the 1st Child through this important examination and _then_ put in the relocation application.

35     The timing of the relocation was perhaps precipitous as it meant splitting up 3 siblings into 2 different jurisdictions with the one remaining living in a totally new environment for an important phase of her academic life. This the Mother recognised but she found it satisfactory for the 1st Child to be left behind in Singapore for a year whilst she relocated with the 2 other Children.

#### Taekwondo – National Squad

36     The 1st Child is in the National Team and this is highly commendable. This is a rare and important opportunity and she is being groomed to participate in the South East Asian games in 2021. The Mother said that she was cognisant of this and had located suitable gyms in the USA for the 1st Child to continue with her training.

37     I could not see how the training in these new gyms in the USA could replace this opportunity for the 1st Child who has been engaged in Taekwondo for many years and was now close to representing Singapore in world class events. The support from the gyms in the USA could hardly replace the instructors she had been with since she was a young child. The 1st Child’s talent in this area should not be short-changed and there was a concern as to how she would represent Singapore when she was not training with the National Squad. Surely this was something that the Mother should have thought through and there was also no evidence of any discussion she might have had with the 1st Child’s instructors in Singapore on this aspect of the 1st Child’s Taekwondo future. Nor did she discuss this with the Father.

#### Left behind parent

38     To bolster her case, the Mother said that the relationship between the Father and the Children was distant and that they did not enjoy access with the Father. She then made proposals for access upon relocation which included the Father paying for all costs of travel pertaining to the Children. Her proposals for access appeared to be on the stringent side.

39     The Father naturally gave a different version of the relationship and he exhibited photographs and exchange of texts between him and the Children in particular the 1st Child (as they both are involved in Taekwondo). In her second affidavit, the Mother did an about face and claimed that access going forward would not be an issue and would not be hampered but this did not address the points brought up by the Father. Moving to another part of the world by itself was an issue. Coupled with the Mother’s position in her supporting affidavit that the Father (and his wife) did not have a close bond with the Children, there was cause for concern as to how any form of meaningful access could occur.

40     The Mother submitted further that there was no loss of relationship with the Father because the Father allegedly failed to spend the current access time fully. She measured and quantified the amount of time he was actually spending with the Children and said this was analogous to a distant relationship. I disagreed that the Mother should quantify the time in the manner she had. The relational aspect of a parent-child relationship should not be measured in the way the Mother had chosen to do so; surely quality time was equally important. The loss of relationship with the left-behind parent would definitely be tangible especially for these Children when they move physically to another country. Added to this loss was the fact that the Father was similarly involved in Taekwondo and this commonality of interest would suffer the attrition of the distance the Mother was proposing. The Mother had also chosen to hide details pertaining to the 2nd Child’s mild dyslexia from the Father and this did not reflect well of her intentions in the fostering of a proposed long distance Father-Child relationship.

#### Disruption to Children’s lives

41     It is a given that any relocation is disruptive. The disruption is inevitable but it must still subscribe to the welfare principles.

42     The Father submitted that the application was _mala fides_. I did not agree with that submission and did not make a finding that the application was motivated by bad faith. However, I did take the view that details were certainly lacking and these were details that could have been provided from the get go in the supporting affidavit eg what were these work and personal reasons that caused the relocation application? Lack of details of the husband’s job – was it end of contract? Must the relocation take place now? Looking at the matters that I had raised above, the disruption with these Children’s lives was more impactful than in other cases given the separation of siblings and the timing issues.

#### Ascertaining the Children’s wishes

43     The Mother asked that I interviewed the Children as they would be able to set out their wishes. I declined to do so. I did not make a finding that the Children would have been coached but taken realistically, moving to the USA would seem exciting to children generally. The unenviable task I have before me was to consider whether this would be in their best interests and sometimes it was not about what the Child(ren) wanted; although it was a factor for consideration.

## The factors did not weigh in the Mother’s favour

44     Taken holistically, on a balance, after considering all the factor as set out in the preceding paragraphs and the applicable principles of law, I was not satisfied that relocation _at this point in time_ would be in _these_ Children’s best interests. It could very well be the case that the issue be revisited after the Children could go together and the sorting out of the other matters I had raised.. But for now, I was of the view that relocation was not urgent nor necessarily in the Children’s best interests _right now_.

45     The Mother, as a divorced parent can certainly move on with her life with her husband; however, her wish to relocate to be with her new husband in the USA directly affected the Children as well as the Father’s relationship with the Children because of the resultant separation between the Children from their father.

46     I refer to _TAA v TAB_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 2 SLR 879</span>; <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHCF 1</span> (“_TAA v TAB_”) at \[85\] of the decision and quote \[18\] of _TAA v TAB_:

> _While one should not underestimate the risk of the negative effects on the child arising from frustrating the plans of the parent who is the child’s primary carer, this must be balanced against the law’s expectations that parents must place the needs of their children before their own. A parent with care of the children is no longer as free to live life as he or she may have been had he or she been single or divorced without children. Parents in functional families make sacrifices in their lifestyles all the time for their children. One may have to decline an attractive overseas job posting because of the needs of the children. Raising children requires heavy commitment. The law expects no less from parents in post-divorce circumstances. This is not to say that the law does not recognise the difficulties and pain parents may have to bear, but children do grow up and such sacrifice is not demanded endlessly of a parent. Sacrifices may have to be made temporarily in the years when the children require them. The law chooses to place the welfare of the child above all else._

47     Having considered the Children’s needs and best interests, I made the decision that relocation should not occur in September 2019 or early 2020 as applied for by the Mother. The Mother’s plans must be relegated to a secondary position _vis a vis_ the Children’s best interests. It is a _choice_ that the Mother made but that choice must be weighed and evaluated against the impact of the relocation on the welfare of the Children. It could be an issue of timing but again the Mother must address the concerns that had been raised by the Father as well as the Court at the appropriate time.

48     Accordingly, I dismissed the application with costs to the Father.
