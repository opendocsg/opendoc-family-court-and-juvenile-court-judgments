Setting aside of consent order – third parties’ interest

8 January 2020

### District Judge Geraldine Kang:

## Brief Background

1       For ease of reference, parties shall be referred to Husband and Wife in this written grounds of decision, notwithstanding that their divorce was finalised sometime in 2006.

2       Briefly, parties were married in 1987 and their marriage was dissolved sometime in 2006. A consent order was entered into in respect of the ancillary matters (“**Consent Order**”). The Wife was legally represented at the time whereas the Husband was acting in person.

3       The pertinent terms of the Consent Order, in respect of the matrimonial properties are as follows:

> _Clause 5(b) : The Defendant\[Husband\] shall_ **_transfer_** _his share /interest in the matrimonial flat known as Block xxx Singapore xxx (“the Flat”)_ **_to the Plaintiff_** _\[Wife\] upon her payment of outstanding loan, if any, refund of the Plaintiff’s and Defendant’s CFP account monies used to purchase the flat and interest accrued thereon, and payment of any costs and expenses incurred in the transfer._

> _Clause 5(c) : That the Defendant who, together with his brother B are the two joint owners of Block xxx Singapore xxx (“the Bendigo Gardens Property”), and owns 41.089% shares of the said property shall_, **_after the said property is sold, give_** _the whole of the net balance of his shares of the proceeds of sale, after payment of loans, if any, CPF funds used to purchase the said property and interest incurred thereon, payment of any charges or expenses incurred in the sale_, **_to the Plaintiff_**_._

> _Clause 5(d) : That the Defendant who, together with his brother B, are the two joint owners of Block xxx Beauty World Plaza Singapore xxx (“the Beauty World Property”), and owns 50% share of the said property shall_, **_after the said property is sold, give_** _the whole of the net balance of his shares of the proceeds of sale, after payment of loan, if any, CPF funds used to purchase the said property and interest incurred thereon, payment of any charges or expenses incurred in the sale_, **_to the Plaintiff_**_._

(emphasis in original)

4       The Husband has since remarried and has formed a new family unit. Sometime in 2017, the Husband filed a summons for variation (FC/Sum 4113/2017) in respect of the Consent Order but it was dismissed by my sister judge, for which there was no appeal (“**2017 Variation Application**”). As there was no appeal filed against this application, I would not go into the substance and merits of it, save as to briefly state that the Husband had sought to vary the terms in respect of the (i) matrimonial flat by inserting a 3 months deadline for the transfer of the flat to the Wife and (ii) for a mutual sale of the Bendigo Gardens Property and Beauty World Property (collectively, “**the Investment Properties**”) between himself and his brother, B.

5       As stated earlier, the Husband did not file an appeal against the decision of the 2017 Variation Application but proceeded to file a setting aside application in the present FC/Sums 397/2019 in respect of the extracted terms of the Consent Order (“**2019 Setting Aside Application**”) in relation to (i) matrimonial flat and (ii) the Investment Properties. He sought to have this Court set aside the extracted terms of the Consent Order and substituted with new orders. The Wife objected save for a limited variation of the order in respect of the matrimonial HDB flat.

6       Having heard the evidence of both parties as well as taking into account the background surrounding the present case, I dismissed the Husband’s present application on the basis that the legal thresholds for a setting aside application were not met; and further, I was of the opinion that the undisputed fact that there were third party interests in the Investment Properties meant that there was a civil issue to be determined in the High Court. This determination had to be done before the family court could even begin to consider if any new orders could be made in respect of the Consent Order.

7       The Husband is now appealing against the entirety of my decision.

## (1)   Undisputed Facts

8       In respect of the matrimonial HDB flat, over the years neither party had taken steps to effect Clause 5(b) of the Consent Order. In fact, the Husband continued to be financially responsible for the outgoings of the said flat and the Wife continue to reside there, having exclusive occupation of the flat during the entire time. At the material time of the hearing, the Wife was still residing in the matrimonial flat. In this regard, due credit and recognition is given the Husband for not ceasing his payments towards the matrimonial flat. Despite terminating the HDB loan after the divorce, the husband continued to be financially and solely responsible for the mortgage payments by taking out a new private bank loan for which he has faithfully discharged without any contributions on the part of the Wife.

9       In respect of Investment Properties, it was also not disputed that parties had not taken any action on their part either and that there were 2 failed en-bloc attempts, for which the Wife had been hopeful would go through so as to encash her entitlement under the Consent Order.

10     The Consent Order in respect of the Investment Properties only stated the Husband and B’s (who is his older brother) respective interests but over the course of the hearing before me, it was surfaced and not disputed also that there were other family interests[^1] that were not explicitly recorded in the Consent Order (as highlighted in the table below)[^2].

11     Whilst the Wife was not a legal owner to the Investment Properties, she had registered a caveat on the properties sometime in November 2018[^3].

## (2)   The Law

12     The law relating to varying or setting aside consent orders is stipulated in Section 112(4) of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353):

> _The court may, at any time it thinks fit, extend, vary, revoke or discharge any order made under this section, and may vary any term or condition upon or subject to which any such order has been made._

13     It bears reiterating that the present summons application before me was one of a setting aside and that the Husband had not appealed against the dismissal of his variation application by my sister judge. And thus, I was legally bound to only consider the principles and caselaw in relation to setting aside consent orders.

14     In summary, the Husband contends that Consent Order has become unworkable and therefore ought to be set aside and that there is no prejudice to the Wife for new orders to be substituted as the orders have yet to be implemented notwithstanding the passage of time.[^4]

## (3)   Setting Aside

15     In this regard, both counsels were well versed in the legal principles concerning an application of setting aside. The legal principles as set out by the High Court in **_AON v AOO_** <span class="citation">\[2011\] 2 SLR 926</span> remain good law and thus shall not be repeated here, save as to highlight that I agreed with the Wife’s Counsel’s submissions that on the facts there were no vitiating factors that would merit a setting aside of the orders. Notwithstanding that the Husband was not legally represented at the time of the Consent Order, there was no evidence to suggest that there was any unfair advantage taken in terms of misrepresentation, fraud, duress, or coercion on the part of the Wife.

16     Given the passage of time that has lapsed, the Husband’s arguments in support of setting aside the Consent Order was also diminished. In my opinion, his recourse would have been to file an appeal against the dismissal of his 2017 Variation Application.

## (4)   Third Parties’ Interests in the Investment Properties

17     Even if the case for setting aside had been met insofar as the legal thresholds had been satisfied, the fact was that there were third parties interests in the properties that had to be dealt with. By the husband’s own admission, he conceded that due to the fact that his relationship with his siblings were slightly strained, he did not wish to litigate this issue in the High Court and was hoping to save on legal costs.

18     In the case of **_UDA v UDB <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGCA 20</span>_** decided by the Court of Appeal, the issue of third parties interests in a matrimonial property was expounded at length. Briefly, the Court of Appeal held that the Women’s Charter did not confer the Family Court the power to hear and determine a third party’s claim to an alleged matrimonial asset or make orders against a third party. This was clear from the wording of section 112 (Cap. 353):

> (a)     The Court only had power to divide matrimonial assets “when granting or subsequent to the grant of a judgment of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage”. This power arose in the specific context of matrimonial proceedings, which involved the spouses alone and not a third party.

> (b)     The division of assets could only be ordered “between the parties” i.e. the spouses and not a third party.

> (c)     The court could only divide a “matrimonial asset”, which was defined in section 112(10) (Cap. 353) as any assets “acquired” by one or both spouses. The word “acquired” did not mean acquisition of bare legal title, but acquisition of beneficial ownership (with or without legal title). As asset beneficially owned by a third party could not be divided under section 112 (Cap. 353).

19     The Court of Appeal also gave guidance as to the proper approach to third party claims arising in section 112 (Cap. 353) proceedings. Where a third party wished to directly assert his rights to a disputed asset, he should commence separate civil proceedings against either or both spouses. He could also apply to intervene and notify the family court of his alleged interest, in which case the family court should stay the section 112 (Cap. 353) proceedings.

20     However, if the family court was aware of the third party’s alleged interests but no separate action had been commenced, various options might be available depending on the legal ownership of the property.

21     I was mindful that this was not a case that I was determining at first instance so the factual background and context of **_UDA v UDB_** could be distinguished. In **_UDA v UDB_**, the intervener was asserting her rights to the disputed assets and the judge had to stay the proceedings since she could not determine the intervener’s claim under section 112 (Cap 353) and the disputed assets would be a matrimonial assets (if indeed it was a matrimonial asset).

22     However, even in the event that I was minded to substitute the earlier Consent Order, I had no evidence as to the nature of the third party’s claim(s) if any to the Investment Properties. Whether or not the Investment Properties formed part of the matrimonial pool was also relevant for the purposes of determination of what was to be a fair and equitable division (and if they did, what percentage of it?). Added to the complexity of this case, was the fact that an order was also being sought to be varied by the Wife and/or substituted by the Husband in respect of the matrimonial flat.

23     Thus, I was of the opinion the broad principles of **_UDA v UDB_** applied to the present case in so far as the approach to be taken in determining third party rights. I was not able to make a determination, as not only did I lack the jurisdictional powers, I would add that the affidavits were devoid and silent of the various third parties’ position.

24     It was also not lost on me that by virtue of the Wife’s action of registering a caveat on the Investment Properties in November 2018 meant that she too now had an interest in the property, even if there was no determination of whether or not the Investment Properties were part of the matrimonial pool of assets to be divided.

## (5)   Application of the Law to the Facts

25     Since the divorce was finalised by consent more than a decade ago, parties were content to leave matters status quo. If there were any allegations that would vitiated either of their consent, it should have been raised earlier.

26     I simply did not have the jurisdiction to set aside a consent order that was validly reached.

27     Whilst the Wife was not disputing the fact that the Consent Order in respect of the matrimonial flat was unworkable in practice, she was only willing to consent to a variation of it on her proposed terms[^5]. As parties were not able to reach an agreement on this, I was not minded to substitute new orders in respect of the matrimonial flat. For the repeated reason that I did not have jurisdiction to set aside a validly reached consent order; and there was also the fact that had I chosen to substitute new orders in respect of the matrimonial flat without a global approach on the division of the Investment Properties being taken into account, the eventual outcome may not be a fair and equitable one in the circumstances.

28     The Husband argued also that new orders had to be substituted in respect of the Investment Properties as they were presently unworkable due to third parties’ interests. However, I did not find that this argument held much weight for the following reasons:

> (a)     The fact that there were third parties interests in the Investment Properties were a known fact at the time of the signing of the Consent Order. In fact, it was also not disputed that his brother, B had endorsed on the Draft Consent Order at the material time (even though he was not a party to the divorce proceedings as an intervener at that time.)

> (b)     Further the manner in which the order was currently drafted meant that the Husband would have to pay to the Wife from **_his_** share of the proceeds should the Investment Properties be sold. A literal reading of it did not show that the order was unworkable. If and when the Investment Properties were sold, the husband would simply have to give the net proceeds of his share of the sale.

29     It bears noting however that the Husband did take a rather conciliatory approach by offering an initial cash sum of $86,000 to $100,000 in respect of the Wife’s entitlement in the Investment Properties. And in addition, he was prepared to redeem the outstanding loan on the matrimonial flat and transfer the said flat to her without any refund to his CPF.[^6] But this was not agreeable to the Wife.

30     The values of the matrimonial property and/or the Investment Properties would likely have appreciated in the course of the past decade but without the benefit of a proper valuation and a rightful determination of the respective spouses and/or third party interests (if any), it would not have been appropriate for the family courts, without any inherent jurisdiction to make orders afresh when there was no legal basis to do so.

31     I was unable to determine the matrimonial asset pool – it would have been akin to a de novo hearing that I was conducting in a vacuum, which would have been erroneous on my part.

## (6)   The Court’s Findings and Decision

32     Accordingly, I dismissed the Husband’s present application in its entirety but made no orders to costs.
