Family Law – Child Issues – Custody – Care and Control – Access – Matrimonial Assets – Division – Children’s Maintenance

1 August 2019

### District Judge Suzanne Chin:

## Introduction

1       This is my judgement in respect of ancillary orders made in the divorce proceedings between the parties. The defendant husband (“Husband”) has filed an appeal against part of my orders in respect of the division of matrimonial property, access to the 2 children of the marriage and maintenance for the 2 children.

## Background

2       The parties were married on xxx 2000 and there are 2 daughters from the marriage of ages 14 and 13. The relationship between the parties started to breakdown in 2008. In December 2009, the plaintiff wife (“Wife”) filed for Judicial Separation. At the time, the Husband sought reconciliation and the Wife agreed to withdraw her application and parties continued with the marriage. In 2014 however, cracks in the marriage started to surface again. The Wife and children moved out of the matrimonial home to live with the Wife’s parents sometime in 2017.

3       The Wife commenced the current divorce proceedings on 10 October 2017 on the grounds of unreasonable behaviour. The Husband filed a counterclaim citing the Wife’s unreasonable behaviour. Eventually parties agreed to proceed with the divorce on the basis of both the claim and the counterclaim and Interim Judgement was granted on 28 March 2018. This was a long marriage which had lasted for 18 years.

## My orders and the appeal

4       The ancillary matters first came for hearing before me on 25 April 2019 and on 14 May 2019, I made the following orders:

> A.      _Custody, Care and Control and Access_

> 1.      _There shall be joint custody of the 2 children of the marriage with care and control to the Plaintiff._

> 2.      _Defendant shall have supervised access with the child at the DSSA (under the DSSA supervised visitation programme) once a week for 8 sessions. Parties may be required to attend any other programme including counselling, as determined by the DSSA._

> 3.      _Upon completion of supervised access as abovestated, the Defendant shall have access to the children as follows:_

>> a.        _Weekend access every Saturday from 9 am to Sunday 10am;_

>> b.        _Weekday dinner access once a week to be arranged directly with the children from 6pm to 9 pm;_

>> c.        _Half of all school holidays;_

>> d.        _For Chinese New Year on an alternate basis:_

>>> (i)        _On even years, from 5pm on the eve of Chinese New Year to the 1st day of Chinese New Year at 8pm; and_

>>> (ii)        _On odd years, from 12pm to 3pm for lunch access on the eve of Chinese New Year and from 8pm on the 1st day of Chinese New Year to 8pm on the 2nd day of Chinese New Year._

>> e.        _For Christmas on an alternate basis:_

>>> (i)        _On even years from 5pm on Christmas Eve to 11am Christmas Day; and_

>>> (ii)        _On odd years from 11am Christmas Day to 8pm on Christmas Day._

>> f.        _Other than as stated in para 4 and 5, alternate public holiday access from eve of public holiday 6pm to 6pm on the public holiday;_

> B.      _Division of Matrimonial Assets_

> 3.      _In full and final settlement of all issues relating to the division of property:_

>> (a)        _that the Defendant’s rights, interest and share in the matrimonial property known as and situated at xxx which is in the joint names of the Plaintiff and the Defendant, shall be transferred to the Plaintiff (other than by way of sale) within three (3) months from the date of Certificate of Making Interim Judgment Final without the payment of any consideration or refund of CPF to the Defendant._

>> (b)        _This Order is made subject to the Central Provident Fund Act (Cap. 36) ("CPF Act") and the subsidiary legislation made thereunder made in respect of the Member's CPF moneys, property, investments. The Board shall give effect to the terms of this order in accordance with the provisions of the CPF Act and the subsidiary legislation made thereunder._

>> (c)        _The Registrar or Deputy Registrar of the Family Justice Courts under section 31 of the Family Justice Act (Act 27 of 2014) is empowered to execute, sign or indorse all necessary documents relating to matters contained in this order on behalf of either party should either party fail to do so within seven (7) days of written request being made to the party._

>> (d)        _The Defendant shall pay to the Plaintiff a sum of $74,000 within 3 months from the date of Certificate of Making Interim Judgment Final._

>> (e)        _That each party shall retain his or her own other assets that are in their respective sole names._

> C.      _Wife Maintenance_

> 4.      _There shall be no wife maintenance payable by the Defendant to the Plaintiff._

> D.      _Child Maintenance_

> 5a.      _The Defendant shall pay as child maintenance, a monthly amount of $1,840 for the elder child and $1,650 second child._

> b.      _In addition, the Husband is to bear 50% of the following:_

>> (i)        _cost of replacement of the Iphone and Ipad of the children once every 2 years; and_

>> (ii)        _cost of any compulsory school trips, CCA fees, and any other necessary and required miscellaneous fees and enrichment fees._

> _Within 14 days of the provision of the relevant receipts_

> 6.      _Liberty to apply._

5       The Husband filed an appeal on 28 May 2019 against my orders relating to (a) the terms of access to the 2 children of the marriage; (b) division of matrimonial assets; (c) the children’s maintenance; and (d) costs. I now set forth the reasons for my decision.

## Terms of Access

6       The Husband has not appealed against my orders granting sole care and control of the child to the Wife but only on my access orders and accordingly, I will only be dealing with the issue of access below.

7       The Wife and children moved out of the matrimonial home in March 2017 and initially resided at her parents’ home. More recently, they moved to rented premises and have resided there up until the date of the Ancillary Matters hearing. Parties informed me that current access arrangements provided access to the Husband on alternate Saturdays but there was some dispute on the access hours.

8       According to the Husband, access on Saturdays was supposed to have been from Saturdays 10am to 7pm but the Wife has tried to limit his access by cutting down the hours which now start from 11.30am instead of 10am. The Wife agreed that access hours were from 11.30am to 10am, she pointed out to the court that the Husband has not been interested in access to the children often missing his access sessions. She maintained that she would be prepared to continue with these current access arrangements but wanted the Husband to liaise directly with the children for arrangements.

9       Upon examination of the evidence before me, it was apparent to me that there were issues in the relationship between the children and the Husband. In this regard, the Husband contended that the Wife was trying to obstruct his access in a bid to distance the children from him. The evidence also pointed to some reluctance on the part of the children to meet with their father for access. In light of this, I was of the view that it would be in the best interests of the children for some third party support and counselling to be given to both the Father and the children and made orders directing that access take place at the relevant Divorce Support Specialist Agency for 8 weekly sessions before full access kicks in. This would allow for a third party counsellor to observe the interactions of the Father with his children and provide support and counselling to all of them as well as the Wife to help deal with any issues observed. I also felt that the current alternate Saturday access was somewhat limited and that it would be in the best interests of the children for additional access to be arranged and accordingly made provision for weekly dinner access, weekly overnight access from Saturday to Sunday, half of all school holidays, and alternate public holiday including specific arrangements for Chinese New Year and Christmas. Accordingly, I made access orders providing for more access after the supervised access sessions have been completed.

## Division of Matrimonial Assets

## The Law

10     Section 112(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353) (“WC”) empowers the Court to make a division of matrimonial assets in such proportion as the courts deems to be “just and equitable”. In deciding on the question of division, a court must “have regard to all the circumstances of the case” and these include the following non-exhaustive list of factors:

> (a)     the extent of contributions made by each party in money, property or work towards acquiring, improving or maintaining the matrimonial assets;

> (b)     any debt owing or obligation incurred or undertaken by either party in money, property or work towards acquiring, improving or maintaining the matrimonial assets;

> (c)     the needs of the children (if any) of the marriage;

> (d)     the extent of the contributions made by each party to the welfare of the family, including looking after the home or caring for the family or any aged or infirm relative or dependant of either party;

> (e)     any agreement between the parties with respect to the ownership and division of the matrimonial assets made in contemplation of divorce;

> (f)     any period of rent-free occupation or other benefit enjoyed by one party in the matrimonial home to the exclusion of the other party;

> (g)     the giving of assistance or support by one party to the other (whether or not of a material kind), including the giving of assistance or support which aids the other party in the carrying on of his or her occupation or business; and

> (h)     The matters referred to in section 114(1) so far as they are relevant.

11     The court drew guidance from the case of _Sim Kim Heng Andrew v Wee Siew Gee_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGHC 271</span> where George Wei JC at \[52\] referred to the approach endorsed by the Court of Appeal in _ATT v ATS_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 2 SLR 859</span> as follows:

> “The first step would be to delineate the pool of matrimonial assets to be divided. The second step is to assess the value of the pool so that the court’s deliberations can be made with reference to a working quantum. The third step is to consider all the circumstances of the case including but not limited to the specific factors identified in s 112(2), paying particular attention to the direct financial contributions as well as the indirect non-financial contributions of each party. “

12     In the case of _Twiss, Christopher James Hans v Twiss, Yvonne Prendergast_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGCA 52</span>, the Court of Appeal reaffirmed the principles and approach set out in its recent decision of _ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span> (“ANJ v ANK”) setting out the following broad steps:

> “(a)  Express as a ratio the parties’ direct contributions relative to each other, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets;

> (b)    Express as second ratio the parties’ indirect contributions relative to each other, having regard to both financial and non-financial contributions; and

> (c)    Derive the parties’ overall contributions relative to each other taking an average of the two ratios above, keeping in mind that, depending on the circumstances of each case, the direct and indirect contributions may not be accorded equal weight and one of the two ratios may be accorded more significance than the other.”

## First Step - Pool of matrimonial assets and their values

13     The matrimonial assets comprised of the matrimonial home, cash in bank accounts, CPF monies, insurance policies, shares and investments, a club membership as well as motor vehicles. While parties conceded that the matrimonial flat fell within the pool, the value of the matrimonial flat was disputed. The Wife’s assets which fell within the matrimonial pool and their values were undisputed totalling a sum of $901,298. The list of the Husband’s assets that fell within the matrimonial pool were disputed and the values of some of these disputed. Both parties also requested that the court draw adverse inferences against the other party and asked that the court include certain sums back into the pool. I shall deal with each of these below.

#### Value of the matrimonial home

14     The Wife claimed a value of $980,000 for the matrimonial flat and provided a list of prices that similar flats in the area were being marketed at. The Husband claimed a value of $915,000 and provided previously transacted prices for a unit on a higher floor. During the hearing however, counsel for the Husband indicated that he would agree to taking an average of the 2 values proposed by the parties. Taking into consideration all of this, I considered that it would be fair for an average of the proposed values to be taken and accordingly, I attributed a value of $947,500 to the matrimonial flat. After accounting for the outstanding loan value, which was not disputed, I determined that the matrimonial home held a net value of $805,469.

#### Husband’s assets

15     The inclusion of the monies in the Husband’s CPF account was not disputed and the amount of these monies was also not in dispute. The Husband also did not dispute the fact that his bank accounts, motor vehicle and club membership should be included into the pool but disputed the value that should be attributed to these assets. In addition, he maintained that the value of his insurance policies and his investments should be left out from the matrimonial pool.

#### Husband’s Assets which he argued were not to be included into the matrimonial pool - Investments – SGX shares

16     The Husband agreed that his SGX shares held a value of $184, 681 as at 31 May 2018 but maintained that this amount should be excluded from the matrimonial pool as the shares were purchased before the marriage. While the Husband made this assertion, he did not provide any evidence to show when exactly the shares were purchased. As such I was unable to accept his bare assertion and determined that his SGX shares should be included as part of the matrimonial pool.

#### Insurance

17     It was not disputed that the Husband’s insurance policies held a value of $203,013. The Husband argued that the total value of his insurance policies should be excluded from the pool as the policies were solely for his benefit and the Wife had made no contributions to these policies. While I accepted that the Wife had not contributed to the insurance policies and will take this into consideration in determining each parties’ direct contributions, the fact that the Wife did not contribute to the insurance policies is not a basis for excluding this from the matrimonial pool. Also the fact that the policies were solely for the benefit of the Husband was not a basis for their exclusion from the matrimonial pool. In any event, during the hearing of the ancillary matters, the Husband’s counsel withdrew his position to exclude the insurance policies and accordingly, I included the insurance policies into the matrimonial pool and attributed a value of $203,013.

#### Bank Accounts

18     While the Husband did not dispute the fact that the monies in his bank accounts formed part of the matrimonial pool, he disputed the value to be attributed to these monies. He argued in this regard that the court should take into consideration the bank account statements showing values at 31 May 2018. The Wife resisted this position and argued that the court should use the values closest to the ancillary matters hearing date. In this regard, she canvassed the position that the bank accounts should be valued based on bank account statements ranging from 31 May 2018 to 31 July 2018. In the case of _UTQ v UTR_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHCF 13</span>, the learned Tan Puay Boon JC noted that the starting point for the valuation of matrimonial assets is the date of the ancillary matters hearing, (_TND v TNC and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 34</span> (“_TND v TNC_”) at \[19\] - \[20\]). In light of this, I accepted the Wife’s position and accordingly attributed a value of $139,635 as the value of the Husband’s bank accounts.

#### Motor Vehicle

19     It was not disputed that the Husband’s motor vehicle held an open market value of $70,000. What was in dispute was the outstanding amount of hire purchase payable in respect of this vehicle. The Husband contended that there was an amount of $35,000 outstanding on his loan for the vehicle but provided no documentation or evidence of any kind to support his position. In light of this and particularly considering the fact that documents relating to loans on vehicles are fairly easy to obtain, I was not able to accept the Husband’s position and took into account the entire amount of $70,000.

#### Club membership

20     The Husband put forward a net value of $18,000 claiming that this was calculated based on a value of $28,000 for the club membership and deducting the transfer fee of $10,000. The Husband tendered no evidence to support his position. In contrast, the Wife tendered evidence that reflected the price of $32,500[^1]. In the absence of any other evidence provided, I accepted the Wife’s evidence and attributed a value of $32,500 to the club membership.

## Drawing of an adverse inference - Amounts to be added into the pool

21     In **_Chan Tin Sun v Fong Quay Sim_** **<span class="citation">\[2015\] 2 SLR 195</span>**, the Court of Appeal at \[62\] referred to the decision of _Koh Bee Choo v Choo Chai Huah_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] SGCA 21</span> on drawing of adverse inferences:

> “In order for the court to draw an adverse inference, there must be:

>> (a)    a substratum of evidence that establishes a _prima facie_ case against the person against whom the inference is to be drawn; and

>> (b)    that person must have had some particular access to the information he is said to be hiding.”

The Court of Appeal set forth 2 alternative approaches in giving effect to the adverse inference:

> “\[64\] There are at least two alternative approaches to give effect to the adverse inference drawn against a spouse, both of which have been endorsed by this court: see _NK v NL_ at \[61\] – \[62\]. The first approach is for the court to make a finding of the value of the undisclosed assets on the available evidence and for the party dissatisfied with the value attributed to show that it is unreasonable; if the dissatisfied party is unable to do so, the value is then included in the matrimonial pool for division (see, for example, the Singapore High Court decision of _Tay Sin Tor v Tay Chay Eng_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 2 SLR(R) 385</span> at \[18\]). Although it endorsed this approach, the court in _NK v NL_ also cautioned against “unnecessary speculation with respect to the specific values of undeclared assets” and instead held (at \[62\]) that in the circumstances of the case, “it might be more just and equitable (not to mention, practical) to order a higher proportion of the known assets to be given to the wife.

#### The Husband’s Investments – SGX shares

22     The Wife was requesting for the Husband to account for the value of his SGX shares based on an earlier SGX statement of account of July 2014[^2]. In this regard, the Wife drew the court’s attention to the statement of July 2014 which reflected that the amount standing in the Husband’s SGX account totalled a sum of $488,630. She explained that she had filed a summons for Discovery and Interrogatories requesting for the Husband to explain what had happened to these monies. While parties eventually reached a consent order on this issue of discovery and interrogatories whereby the Husband agreed to provide relevant documents as well as an explanation on what had happened to these monies, no documentation was provided by the Husband. The Husband’s counsel explained to the court that his client had advised him that it would be very tedious to provide the documents to the court and accordingly, he had not provided the documents. The Wife argued that the Husband had not made full and frank disclosure and had not explained and accordingly an adverse inference should be drawn against him.

23     Upon consideration of all of the evidence before me, I agreed with the Wife that the Husband had not made full and frank disclosure on this issue especially after he agreed to and I determined that it would be appropriate in the circumstances to draw and adverse inference against him. I accordingly added the sum of $303,949 back into the pool.

24     Taking into account all of the above, I arrived at the conclusion that the total value of the matrimonial pool amounted to $3,070,386. This comprised of $805,469 for the matrimonial property, $901,298 for the Wife’s assets and $1,363,619 for the Husband’s assets.

## Direct Contributions

25     Having determined the assets that fell within the matrimonial pool and their values, I proceeded to determine the direct contributions made by each party.

#### Direct Contributions to the Matrimonial Home

26     The parties did not dispute the amounts of CPF contributions each made towards the property. Excluding interest, the Wife contributed a sum of $227,316 while the Husband contributed $260,649. The parties disputed the amounts of cash each had paid towards the acquisition of the property as well as towards renovations.

27     The Husband claimed that he had paid $100,000 in cash. While it was not stated on affidavit, his counsel claimed that this comprised of 20% purchase price, legal fees and stamp fees. Counsel for the Husband conceded that his client had not provided any documentation to support his contentions.

28     The Wife referred to the Husband’s handwritten note[^3] which showed the amounts paid by the parties in respect of the first 20% of the purchase price for the matrimonial home. As this handwritten note had been tendered by the Wife in her second affidavit of assets and means and as the Husband had filed a further affidavit thereafter without addressing this issue, I accepted that he did not dispute the Wife’s position in this regard. Accordingly, I accepted that of the $83,600 which was 20% of the purchase price, the wife had paid $24,600 while the Husband had paid $83,600.

29     The next amount I considered were the contributions by the parties towards the stamp duty paid upon the acquisition of the matrimonial home. The Husband claimed that stamp duty had been shared equally between the parties but the Wife maintained that neither party had paid for stamp duty as this had been borne by the developers[^4]. I noted that the evidence tendered by the Wife clearly reflected that stamp duty had been paid by the developers and accordingly did not include this item into the direct contributions of the parties.

30     The Wife also claimed that she had paid lawyers’ fees of $4,995and also a sum of $12,400 upon the Temporary Occupation Permit being issued for the property in August 2000. With regard to the lawyers’ fees, I found that the evidence clearly showed that the Wife had paid this sum[^5]. As for the sum of $12,400, the Wife explained that this had been paid from the parties’ joint bank account opened on 25 July 2000 and as the Husband had been jobless in the months leading up to the opening of this account, he had made no contributions to the monies in the account[^6]. The Husband did not address these issues and after weighing the Wife’s evidence and submissions, I was satisfied that she had established that she had made these contributions towards the matrimonial home and accordingly included these.

31     The final amount related to renovations. The Husband claimed that he had contributed a total amount of $13,700 for renovations but this included lightings and furniture. The Husband referred to various pages in the affidavits[^7], but I noted that firstly these were very unclear and barely legible. Secondly from what could be seen, they appeared to be quotes and invoices and did not really throw any light on who actually paid for what. Thirdly for the majority of items like maintenance, property tax, air-condition servicing, I was of the view that these are not direct contributions to the property. I will however take these into consideration as part of indirect financial contributions.

32     Taking into consideration all of the above, I determined that the Wife had made direct contributions of 47% towards the matrimonial home as compared to the Husband’s contributions of 53%. Set forth below is a summary as follows:

After including the values of assets held by each of the parties in their own names, I arrived at a direct contribution ratio of 58:42 in favour of the Husband.

## Indirect Contributions

33     The Wife wanted the court to attribute a ratio of 85:15 for indirect contributions in favour of the Wife. She claimed that she had made substantial indirect financial and non-financial contributions towards the marriage. She pointed out that since the Husband started playing golf in 2004, he had been obsessed with the sport and had not made much effort to be involved in the family. The Husband however claimed that the parties had made equal indirect contributions and hence the ratio to be used should be 50:50.

34     This was a marriage of 18 years. Both parties worked throughout the marriage. From the evidence tendered by the parties, I found that at least for the 1st half of the marriage, both parties appeared to contribute somewhat equally. With regard to the indirect financial contributions, while I found that both had contributed to the joint account which was used to pay the household expenses and the children’s expenses, the evidence did point to the fact that the Husband had not always been consistent in his contributions. In addition, I accepted the Wife’s contentions that there were times when instead of putting in monies into the joint account, the Husband had withdrawn monies from the joint account for his own purposes[^8]. It was as such clear on the evidence that the Wife had made more indirect financial contributions than the Husband during the time when the parties were living together. After the Wife and the children moved out of the matrimonial home in March 2017 however, I found that on balance, the Wife bore a larger share particularly in paying for the children’s expenses and providing for their needs even though the Husband did continue to make some contributions.

35     With regard to the indirect non-financial contributions, by the Husband’s own admission, the Wife had helped and supported him during the early years of the marriage when he was studying to improve his qualifications. When the children arrived, even though both parties had worked throughout the marriage, I was persuaded that the Wife had spent more time taking care of the children’s needs while the Husband spent a large proportion of his time playing golf. Her affidavit provided far more detail on the arrangements relating to the children and it was clear to me that notwithstanding that the parties had a domestic helper to support them, it was the Wife who had taken responsibility for the education of the children, meticulously making arrangements nurture and support the children. I also noted that by his own admission, the Husband admitted golf was part of his portfolio as he had to organise golfing sessions for his superior. The evidence also pointed to the fact that he would take golfing trips overseas on a fairly regular basis[^9]9. This would of course mean that the Husband would have had less time to spend with the children. I also noted that since March 2017 when the Wife and the children moved out of the house, the Husband had spent much less time with the children and being involved in the children.

36     After careful consideration of all the evidence before me, while it was apparent that both parties had contributed to the marriage, I found that on balance, the Wife’s indirect contributions, both financial and non-financial were far higher than the Husband’s especially over the last 2 years. Taking into account the length of the marriage and adopting a broad brush approach, I determined that the appropriate ratio to be applied for indirect contributions was 75:25 in favour of the Wife. In coming to this determination, I accepted the Wife’s contentions that she had played a bigger role in tending to the children’s needs throughout their marriage and the running of the household. I also took into account the support that the Wife had provided to the Husband during the early years of the marriage when he did his part-time Masters in NUS and during his 2nd Masters course.

37     Taking an average of the 2 ratios I had determined for the direct contributions as well as the indirect contributions of the parties, I arrived at a ratio of 58.5: 41.5 in favour of the Wife.

38     In _AVM v AWH_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 194</span>, the learned Vinodh Coomaraswamy J referred to the final step in the structured approach of _ANJ v ANK_:

> “Finally, make any adjustments which are necessary to arrive at a just and equitable division of the matrimonial assets. The necessary adjustment can be made either by increasing or decreasing the average ratio derived in the third step or by attaching greater weight to one of the component ratios derived in the first step or the second step. The adjustment in this final step is a qualitative adjustment based on the court’s sense of what is fair and just. It is made to recognise that, in certain cases and on certain facts, one type of contribution may carry greater importance than the other. It is also the opportunity to take into account all the circumstances of the case as well as the factors enumerated in s 112(2) of the Women's Charter other than in s 112(2)(a) and (d).”

39     I noted the Husband had rent free occupation of the matrimonial home since the Wife moved out with the children in March 2017. The Husband’s counsel argued that no adjustments should be made as the Wife had moved out on her own accord and he had never forced her out. Regardless of the reasons for the Wife leaving the matrimonial home, the fact of the matter is that the Husband has had sole occupation of the matrimonial home for a period of about 2 years. Bearing in mind the provisions of s 112 of the Women’s Charter, I made an adjustment to take into consideration the rent free occupation by the Husband. Taking into account all of this and adopting a broad brush approach, my final decision was that the Wife should receive 60% of the matrimonial assets with the Husband receiving 40%. After taking into account the assets held in the Wife’s own name, I determined that the Wife should receive the entire matrimonial flat with no refund of CPF to Husband and no consideration. In addition, she should receive from the Husband a sum of $74,051 ($74,000).

## Maintenance for children

40     The Wife earned a salary $ 10,670 as a teacher while the Husband was a Supervisor earning a monthly salary of $10,060. Based on the parties’ annual earnings which included bonuses however, the parties’ salaries were in the ratio of 48:52 in favour of the Husband. The Wife claimed that the children’s expenses amounted to $5,374 and $4,441 and was asking or the Husband to bear the amount in the ratio of their respective salaries. The Husband wanted the parties to bear the children’s reasonable expenses in the ratio of 50:50.

41     I first turned to determining the reasonable expenses of each of the children. Upon review of each parties’ position, I came to the conclusion that the reasonable expenses for the children stood at $3,531 and $3,168. This excluded the replacement of ipads and iphones for which the Husband indicated he would bear half, as well as the elder child’s CCA fees, school trips, miscellaneous fees and enrichment fees. Set forth in the table below is each parties’ position on the child’s expenses as well as the amount that the Court determined as reasonable upon consideration of each party’s position:

42     As the ratio of the parties’ salaries were approximately equal to each other’s I found it reasonable for the parties to share the children’s expenses equally. Accordingly, I made orders for the Husband to pay monthly maintenance of $1,840 for the 1st child and $1,650 for the 2nd child. In addition, I made orders for the Husband to bear 50% of the cost of replacement of the children’s iphones and ipads every 2 years as well as the cost of any compulsory school trips, CCA fees and other miscellaneous fees and enrichment fees within 14 days of the provision the relevant receipts.

## Conclusion

43     In conclusion, upon careful consideration of all the evidence and submissions of the parties I made orders on the children’s issues, issues of division of property and maintenance of the Wife and the children as I considered just and equitable.
