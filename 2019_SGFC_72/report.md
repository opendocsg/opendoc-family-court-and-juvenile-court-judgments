### District Judge Kathryn Thong:

## Introduction

1       The complainant husband (“Husband”) had sought to vary a maintenance order made in 2018 in favour of the respondent wife (“Wife”).

2       At the material time of the hearing before this Court, the Husband was earning around $25,000 a month as a Director in an IT company. The Wife is an undischarged bankrupt. Their only child, a son whom I shall refer to as J, presently resides with the Husband and a domestic helper.

3       I eventually dismissed the Husband’s application as I found that there was no change in his financial circumstances, let alone a material one, to justify a downward variation of the maintenance order under section 72 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353). As conceded by the Husband, there had been no change in his salary. Rather, his motivation for the variation application appeared to be his dissatisfaction with the Wife remaining dependent on him for maintenance instead of seeking gainful employment.

4       The Husband has appealed against my orders.

## Background

5       Parties were married on 29 October 2016. Their son, J, was born in early 2017. The Husband is a Director in an Accounts Executive role earning $25,496.25 a month; the Wife is unemployed and has been an undischarged bankrupt since July 2013. I do not think it presumptuous to suggest that but-for section 94(1) of the Women’s Charter, divorce proceedings would have been filed by now.

6       Parties are presently in the throes of cross-guardianship proceedings and interlocutory applications before me, where the Husband has been represented by Ms Foo Soon Yien (since 21 May 2018 when the notice of change of solicitor was filed) and the Wife by Mr Sudhershen. Brief mention of these proceedings is necessary to lend context to counsel’s arguments in this variation hearing and the orders I eventually made.

7       When J was 10 months old, the Husband left the matrimonial home with him, leaving the homemaker Wife alone in their (then) rented premises at Jalan XX. It was January 2018 and J has since remained with the Husband at a location the Husband refuses to disclose to the Wife.

8       The Husband and J’s departure from the matrimonial home started a chain of unfortunate and tumultuous events which regrettably, continues today in the context of the guardianship proceedings.

9       To give a quick snapshot of what has transpired on that front, from 8 May 2018 to 20 December 2018 (_i.e._ from the time the 2018 MO was made to the time the Husband filed this variation application) a total of 27 interlocutory applications and 7 appeals had been filed by the Husband. The Mother filed three interlocutory applications.

10     From 21 December 2018 to date, the Husband has filed 15 interlocutory applications and two appeals; the Mother has filed one interlocutory application.

11     It suffices to note that at the time of this hearing before me, J had just turned 2 years old, and there were interim orders for the Wife to have daily, supervised access to him for 6 hours each time. Also, a psychiatrist had already been appointed to assess the Wife’s mental health for the purpose of the cross-guardianship proceedings - it is the Husband’s fervent belief that the Wife has a mental disorder that prevents her from caring for J.

## The 2018 Maintenance Order and subsequent events

12     On 7 May 2018, _vide_ MSS 101/2018, the Husband was ordered to pay a sum of $2,700.00 as monthly maintenance to the Wife with effect from 15 May 2018 and thereafter on every 15th of each month.

13     Further terms of this Order (“the 2018 MO”) were as follows:

In addition, the Husband shall pay for the following expenses directly:

(a)     The rental of the property at Jalan XX until the expiry of its current lease on 15 February 2019.

By 15 November 2018, parties shall agree on suitable accommodation for the Wife to move into after 15 February 2019 (bearing in mind that it has to be also suitable for the parties’ child whom the Wife may spend time with as agreed or determined under separate custody proceedings). Parties shall also agree on how the Husband shall contribute towards the accommodation.

In the event that no agreement is reached by 15 November 2018 (it is however strongly encouraged that parties should co-operate and agree on appropriate accommodation for the Wife), either party shall be at liberty to apply for a variation of this order for the Court to determine the same;

(b)     Utilities and internet charges of the property at Jalan XX until the expiry of its current lease on 15 February 2019.

Both parties shall cooperate to ensure that the Husband receives email copies of these bills for payment; and

(c)     The Wife’s medical expenses insofar as covered by the Husband’s employer and he shall ensure that this arrangement continues.

Each party to bear their own costs.

14     On 28 August 2018, the Wife’s solicitors wrote to Husband’s, asking for proposals on the alternative accommodation as envisaged under the 2018 MO. Needless to say, this gave rise to even further contention between the parties as will be seen at \[57\] – \[62\] below.

15     As a point of interest, in September 2018, the Husband sought leave to file a notice of appeal out of time against the 2018 MO. His application was dismissed with costs in October 2018.

## The variation application and parties’ respective cases

16     The Husband sought to vary the 2018 MO as follows:

(a)     The monthly maintenance be reduced from $2,700.00 to $1,000.00 with immediate effect and for a period of 6 months only;

(b)     That the Wife bears her own utilities and internet charges;

(c)     That the Wife be responsible for the payment of rental of the new accommodation.

### The Husband’s case

17     Overall, the Husband’s position was that he was being financially drained as his monthly expenses came up to $44,588. This included _inter alia_, a sum of $11,335 as monthly mortgage repayments for _four_ mortgages, rent on the Jln XX property, as well as his household expenses which of course, included J’s expenses.

18     The Husband relied on the following as changes in his financial circumstances: (i) that he had been unable to secure a tenant for one of the three properties he owns for some 7 months in 2018, this against the backdrop of having four mortgages to service; (ii) his bonus for 2019 would be significantly lesser as his job scope had been reduced since March 2018 due to him working from home; and (iii) his base salary for 2019 had been reduced from $25,496.25 to $19,612.50. This change in salary allegedly arose from a mandated change in pay structure following the acquisition of his company by another.

19     The pith of his application however, appeared to be his complaint that the 2018 MO was encouraging the Wife to lead an “idle life”. In his own words:

“…my reasons for applying for a variation of the \[2018 MO\] are summarised below:

i.    The marriage was 14 months and was a very short one before the marriage broke down and before I had to take J away from the toxic and dangerous environment in the home to protect him, which came at great costs to myself;

ii.    The \[Wife\] is young (35 years old) and able-bodied and must move on with an independent life;

iii.   The \[Wife\] has not shown to be doing anything to support herself or J financially in her past 13 months of idling;

iv.    The \[Wife\] has never contributed a cent to J’s expenses, but sought to jeopardise my employment and drain my finances despite the fact that my income is the only source of food and shelter for J and out of which she is claiming maintenance; and

v.    The \[2018 MO\] was never meant to be indefinite and the amount of maintenance should just be sufficient to enable the \[Wife\] to get back on her feet.”

### The Wife’s case

20     The Wife disputed that the Husband was in dire financial straits. She pointed out he had always owned the three afore-mentioned properties and the rental therefrom would cover at least some part of the mortgage repayments. Second, at the previous maintenance hearing, he had failed to disclose his overseas properties – one in the Philippines and the other in the UK - until he was caught out during cross-examination. The Wife’s suggestion it appeared, was that he could still be hiding the true extent of his asset-holdings in the present application. Third, his work from home arrangement was since January 2018 and there was nothing based on the letter approving this arrangement, that suggested his work had been compromised and his bonus adversely impacted.

21     As an aside, she was cynical that the Husband did indeed work from home and suspected that he claimed to do so merely to obtain an advantage in the guardianship proceedings. She further noted that his employment contract, pay slips and bank statements were not produced in the hearing.

22     Expectedly, she objected to the Husband’s proposal to reduce her maintenance to $1,000.00. She explained that the Husband had inflicted stress and anxiety by “inundating” her with proceedings and she thus required regular sessions with her therapist. She also had to support J’s expenses during the time that J was with her, particularly as the Husband refused to share any of J’s toys and necessities during her access.

23     The Wife denied that she was “idling” away. She claimed she was not averse to finding a job at a suitable juncture. Yet, with the deluge of court proceedings brought on by the Husband, there was much uncertainty and she was unable to commit herself to any employer at this point in time. Besides, as _per_ her evidence in the previous maintenance hearing, parties had always agreed that she would be a stay at home mother, and it was in J’s best interests that she remains available to care for him as she did prior to him being taken from her.

## The applicable legal principles

24     Section 72 of the Women’s Charter provides that “on proof of a change in the circumstances” of a person being ordered to pay maintenance, his wife or child, “or for other good cause” being shown to the satisfaction of the court, the court may rescind a maintenance order or may vary it as it thinks fit.

25     In my view, there must first be cogent evidence of such a change in circumstances, and second, a demonstration that such a change warranted a variation of the maintenance order. I venture that some guidance may be taken from the superior courts where they have dealt with cases brought under section 118 of the Women’s Charter, where the Court is conferred powers to vary or rescind maintenance orders where there has, _inter alia_, been “any material change in the circumstances”.

26     In _George Sappooran Singh v Gordip d/o Mardip Garsingh_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 197</span>, the High Court remarked that an applicant must prove with cogent, convincing evidence that a material change in circumstances has occurred so that an application is not used as a back door to appeal against the original order.

27     Further, such circumstances must be those prevailing at the time the order was entered into and hence any material changes, must relate to those circumstances. An applicant had to satisfy the Court as to the reasonableness of his conduct in assuming any new obligations that subsequently impacted on his ability to fulfil the maintenance order. This was relevant to assessing if there was indeed a material change in circumstances. For instance, the Court would look to how the payer was seeking to manage the alleged change in circumstances, _eg_. by trimming one’s expenses, to “balance the books”. An insistence that matters be viewed only through one’s own lens only would be an indication of such conduct being unreasonable. Last but not least, the effect of taking on new obligations must be to the effect of crippling or emasculating a payer’s ability to pay the maintenance.

28     In _Tan Sue-Ann v Lim Siang Bok Dennis_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 3 SLR(R) 376</span>, the Court of Appeal also pointed out that subjective expectations and hopes cannot amount to a material change, and that a positive change either in the needs of the wife or ability of the husband is usually required. While both cases deal with a variation under section 118 of the Women’s Charter, I am of the view that these principles are equally applicable to a section 72 application.

## The Court’s findings and decision

### No material change in Husband’s financial circumstances

29     I found that there was no change in the Husband’s financial circumstances to vary the monthly maintenance, much less a material one.

30     To begin with, I was of the view that the Husband’s claim to be financially drained an overstatement and somewhat self-induced. By his own evidence, all his properties were owned prior to the marriage and hence, these mortgages predated the 2018 MO. Nothing had changed.

31     That the rental market had been challenging such that he was unable to rent out one of his properties from May 2018 to Dec 2018, was a risk he assumed when he entered the rental market. Pertinently, I did not see how the lack of rental impacted him so adversely that it amounted to a material change in circumstances. Besides, it was apparent that these properties were but a source of passive income for him – he was by no means relying purely on rental income to get by.

32     In this vein, the passivity of such income was underscored during cross-examination, when it was pointed out to the Husband that he had actually neglected to list on affidavit as part of his monthly outgoings/expenses, a sum of slightly under $1,000 that was being auto-deducted monthly from his bank account for an investment property in the Philippines. The Husband brushed this off as a relatively meagre amount against his astronomical expenses of $44,000 per month. For someone who claimed to be worn out financially, I found it peculiar that one could simply forget an expense of close to $1,000 that had been incurred since 2013, particularly when great pains and expense were taken to prepare his affidavit.

33     I also found it misleading for the Husband to claim that he had to pay $11,335 monthly as mortgage repayment, giving the impression that he was out of pocket every month for such an amount. Indeed, the Husband conceded under cross-examination that the figure of $11,335 simply represented his total liabilities in respect of the various mortgages, but these liabilities did get set off through rental of the properties (albeit in varying degrees, as the extent of set off was obviously dependent on the rental income).

34     In fact, of this $11,335, a sum of $2,750.00 was deduced from his CPF Ordinary Account. In terms of cash outlay then, his total monthly mortgage deductions was $8,585.00 and this would be set off through the rental income. In any event, his evidence was that assuming all the properties could be rented out, his net loss was some $2,000 to $3,000 each month. I do not see how this represented a change from the time the 2018 MO was made since these circumstances would have existed at the time of the 2018 MO. Volatility of the rental market is to be expected and is an inherent risk of the industry. Even if the Husband was now receiving less rental – which was not the case he was running – to belabour the point, the burden remained on him Husband to prove how this had impacted his circumstances adversely, and what measures he had taken to manage his expenses on his reduced income, none of which he had proven or demonstrated.

35     As for his alleged reduction in bonus and salary, there was no documentary evidence to prove either claim. Ironically, the Husband’s own documentary evidence contradicted his position.

36     In an email dated December 2018, the Husband’s company had set out a new sales compensation structure, to be officially rolled out on 1 February 2018. It was an opt-in scheme; its mechanics are immaterial for present purposes. What was crucial was that part of the email that stated regardless of whether one opted into the scheme or not, there would eventually be an arrangement worked out which would “ensure no reduction in base pay.” Under cross-examination, the Husband conceded that his salary had not changed, but averred that it was slated to happen. He offered to update the Court accordingly.

37     Nor was there any evidence that his bonus would be reduced. While the Husband claimed to have had his geographical job scope reduced drastically, there was no such mention of any reduced job scope in a letter dated 2 January 2018 from the Husband’s company. In that letter, the company emphasised its support for flexible work arrangements such as working from home, and stated that such flexibility was based on the scope of work of the particular employee. In the Husband’s case, it noted that his work involved meeting with his partners mostly. The Husband’s preference to work from home whilst remaining in touch with his colleagues in office was something the company endorsed as “completely acceptable”. It even added that the Husband is a “high level performer”, “manages his business well” and is “liked by his peers and customers”.

38     When queried on how this letter suggested a more limited job scope, the Husband explained that it was consistent with his claims, as working from home was to allow him to look after J. As a result, he could not travel as often as before. Yet, there was no evidence – no past year pay slips, commission/bonus payments, or emails exhibited, to show that since January 2018, the Husband’s job scope had indeed been reduced and that further, there was basis for the Husband to believe that his bonus would be reduced in 2019, and if so, by how much.

39     Taking the Husband’s case at its highest, even if he was to eventually suffer a 23% reduction in base salary from $25,496.25 to $19,612.50, applying simplistically a straight-line deduction of 23% to the Wife’s maintenance, her reduced maintenance should then be $2,079.00 and not the derisory $1,000.00 offered by the Husband, and for a period of 6 months at that.

40     In sum, I was of the view that the Husband had failed to demonstrate with cogent evidence, what the changes to his financial circumstances were; how they impacted his ability to pay maintenance; and what reasonable steps he had taken to manage his allegedly reduced income.

41     For completeness, I add that I did not think there was “good cause” either for the monthly maintenance to be varied downwards. The Husband’s objections at \[19\] above, was little more than an articulation of his dissatisfaction with the 2018 MO, and this application appeared to be a thinly veiled backdoor appeal against the 2018 MO order.

### Material change in respect of the Wife’s accommodation and rental

42     The Wife testified that she no longer wished to remain residing at Jln XX, which lease had expired on 15 February 2019. The Husband wanted her to vacate the premises as he was incurring double rent for every day after 15 February 2019 that vacant possession could not be delivered. In my view, these were material changes in circumstances that warranted a variation of the rental. Further context as to the events surrounding the issue of vacating the premises at Jln XX is at \[57\] – \[62\] below.

43     By the time of the hearing, the Wife had set her sights on a condominium unit at Adam XX. She did not think an HDB flat was suitable for herself and J. Counsel for the Husband, Mr Doray, asserted that she could rent a single room in an HDB flat for herself for under $1,000. The Wife disagreed, as she needed to cater for J’s accommodation. Though Mr Doray pointed out that she had not been seeing J that much, she countered that she needed to provide for his accommodation and that she would fight tooth and nail for J’s care and control.

44     I found that going forward, the sum of $3,000.00 as rental was consistent with the standard of living enjoyed by the Wife and child, given that she and J had previously stayed at Jln XX with the rent of $3,600.00 being paid for by the Husband.

45     In arriving at this figure, I had considered relevant that under the prevailing interim access orders, the Wife had daily weekday access to J, for 6 hours each time, subject to such access being supervised. A pertinent point raised by the Wife during cross-examination was that she feared J fussing over his accommodation, should she reside in an HDB flat. While an HDB flat would be sufficient for her own accommodation, she explained that a condominium had swimming facilities which J would enjoy, and it was undisputed that J enjoyed swimming. The estate that she had in mind, had many young children, a good playground, and would be a suitable environment for J to grow up in.

46     To my mind, the issue of her accommodation could not be seen in isolation given the ongoing access orders and the guardianship proceedings that lay in the backdrop. It was the Wife’s case theory that the Husband was attempting to thwart access to J. To this end, the quality of access was clearly viewed by the Wife as being important as it was likely to have a bearing on the eventual guardianship proceedings.

47     Hence, during cross-examination, the Wife expressed concern that J might pick up on discrepancies between his parents’ living standards should she live in an HDB flat. She did not want J perceive himself as living a “lesser life” with her. She shared her view that J was an intuitive child and was already picking up on the acrimony between parties. She believed that J would grow to be selective over time in relation to his living environment and hence, a condominium was most suitable over an HDB flat, to ensure that it was on par with the accommodation presently afforded by the Husband to J.

48     J is now over 2 years old, and I did not think that the Wife’s concerns that he would have a preference for a certain living environment were unreasonable or unfounded. Leaving aside the Wife’s subjective beliefs, I found that it was also in J’s best interests that he enjoyed quality time with the Wife in the interim. To this end, the proximity to a swimming pool that a condominium provides which an HDB flat cannot, was something that would be in J’s best interests as he would not need to travel out for such activities.

49     Given the above, the issue of the nature of the Wife’s accommodation could not simply be disposed of by averring that as she used to stay in a single room HDB flat at $800 per month before she married the Husband, she should now do the same. Nor was the fact that she had not actually been able to enjoy such access with J Without any orders having been made on the guardianship proceedings as to which parent would have care and control of J, I did not see how there was basis to contend that the Wife should now live alone in a HDB flat or one-room apartment. To order as such seemed highly presumptive of the outcome of the guardianship proceedings.

50     For completeness, I would add that I could not agree with Mr Doray’s contention that the Wife was trying to fleece the Husband. There was nothing on evidence to suggest this. She had a rational explanation for her choice of a condominium unit – it was an older condominium, with good facilities and there were good playgrounds in the vicinity. These were not disputed by the Husband. And while Mr Doray asserted that the condominium she had chosen was located in a “wealthy estate”, he had not proffered other condominium units with similar attributes or qualities, which would be cheaper. Instead, he had proposed she rent HDB flats for less than $1,000 a month, or for the Wife to live with her mother, the latter suggestion being clearly unfeasible, given that the interlocutory applications in the guardianship proceedings had revealed a strained relationship between the Wife and her mother at the time, a fact which the Husband had repeatedly raised in the guardianship proceedings against the Wife.

51     Overall, the Wife did not appear to be particularly wedded to her choice of condominium, and testified that she was prepared to consider other options in other locations. Besides, the Wife had brought herself below the interim budget of $3,000.00 (see \[57\] – \[62\] below). If she had been out to exploit the Husband in this manner, she need not have settled on a $2,900.00 rental and would have utilised the full $3,000.00 budget.

52     Bearing in mind that the Husband bore the rental fully under the 2018 MO, and I had found that there was no change in his financial circumstances, I saw no reason to alter this arrangement. However, instead of the utilities and rental being paid separately by the Husband as provided for in the 2018 MO, I ordered that the utilities and outgoings would be borne from this $3,000 budget and in a year’s time, this amount will be reduced to $2,500 and the security deposit would no longer be payable by the Husband should the Wife move to new accommodation.

53     The rationale for these orders was that by that time, _i.e._ a year from this hearing, the guardianship proceedings ought to have concluded and the Wife’s submission that she had been weighed down by court proceedings and unable to commit to a job, should be rendered moot by then. This was a nod to the submission that the Wife should strive for some measure of financial independence and in my view, a year ought to be sufficient to plan her finances.

### The insurance premiums

54     Part of the 2018 MO dealt with insurance coverage for the Wife through the Husband’s employer. It mandated that the Husband was to ensure that the coverage by the Husband’s employer was to continue for the Wife. In this hearing, the Wife complained that the Husband had breached the 2018 MO by failing to inform her of a change in the insurer, such that she was unable to submit her medical claims.

55     The Husband’s retort was that the insurance coverage was no longer as generous as it was before, but she could submit her claims anyway through him.

56     I ordered that the Husband was to continue to cover the Wife’s medical expenses insofar as his company’s insurance policy allows for such coverage, and that he was not to terminate such an arrangement without the prior consent of the Wife, or leave from Court, as the case may be. Where such coverage is not possible for whatever reason, then the Husband shall pay the equivalent of 35% of what would have been covered by his company’s insurance policy for the family, and only up to that amount, and only provided the Wife produces the relevant receipts. I arrived at this proportion by splitting the coverage three ways amongst the family, and rounded up the Wife’s 33% share to 35% given her financial and mental health situation.

### Liability for “double rent” on Jln XX

57     As of the date of the hearing before me, the Wife had not moved out of the Jln XX premises. The Husband exhibited an email from the leasing manager dated 19 February 2019, stating that as vacant possession had not been delivered as of 15 February 2019, the Tenant, i.e. the Husband, shall be charged double rent on the premises. The Husband sought at the hearing for the Wife to bear this double rent and/or claw back such double rent from her.

58     Both parties alleged the other was to blame for the delay in the Wife moving out. I eventually ordered that both parties were to bear the “double rent” equally, the reference point being 15 February 2019. I was of the view that both sides were responsible for the situation that came about. The chronology of events are as follows:

59     I found that at the outset, the W ought to have been more proactive in proposing alternative accommodation for herself, rather than leaving it in the H’s hands to make these proposals. As for the H, I was hard pressed to find that his proposals of accommodation were made with genuine intent to elicit consensus. Indeed, he had known full well the fractious relationship the Wife has with her own mother, even making reference to it in the correspondence. Yet, he proposed in the 30 October 2018 letter, that the Wife live with her mother. And in the 15 November 2018 letter, not only did the H repeat his proposal of finding a single dwelling accommodation for the Wife, he told her that she should pay for the rental herself. These were proposals that the Husband would have known, would be totally unacceptable to the Wife.

60     Most glaringly however, the cheque dated 31 January 2019 for the sum of $2,250.00, was never revealed even to the Court prior to the mention on 13 February 2019. It would have been clear to the Husband and his solicitors after the mention on 31 January 2019 that the Wife was still holding out for an extension of the lease at the Jln XX premises.

61     During cross-examination, the Husband explained that he was busy, and it must have slipped his mind to inform his solicitors of the cheque payment that he had received from the prospective tenant. Given the extent of correspondence between counsel and the urgency the Husband possessed in ensuring the Wife vacated the premises, this explanation was hardly convincing. Nonetheless, even if one were to give him the benefit of the doubt, it did not change the fact that the short notice the Wife had at the mention on 13 February 2019 that staying on at Jln XX was no longer an option, would likely have caught her off guard.

62     In any event, as of 27 March 2019 when I rendered my decision, the Wife was still residing at the Jln XX premises and I ordered that she was to vacate the property by 10 April 2019, failing which, she would bear the double rent fully from that date onwards. In this regard, I found her conduct blameworthy as she had no reasonable explanation for remaining in the Jln XX premises by the time I delivered my decision on 27 March 2019, especially when she had asserted at the hearing before me, that she had a prospective property lined up for which no objective evidence had been furnished.

## Conclusion

63     It was not lost on me that parties started living separately just 14 months after the marriage. I did have some degree of sympathy over the Husband’s predicament of being made to maintain the Wife despite a brief marriage. But it is perhaps the inherent character of most, if not all maintenance orders, that they are by their nature, unhappy orders visited upon parties – the payer often feels it is unwarranted and/or too high; the recipient that it is too low. Yet, given that parties are still married; the Wife remains an undischarged bankrupt; is unemployed and the Husband’s staunch belief that the Wife had a mental disorder, it appeared to me that the Wife had to be maintained in the interim. Further, the ongoing interlocutory applications launched by the Husband under the guardianship proceedings show no sign of abatement, and if the Husband truly believes that the Wife has a mental disorder, then all the more it seems to me, that he should recognise the need for her ongoing maintenance.

64     Overall, the Husband had failed to satisfy the threshold of proving any change, material or otherwise in his circumstances, to justify reducing the maintenance in the manner sought for. His unhappiness at having to maintain his Wife and the arguments he has made on the brief duration of the marriage; her ability to support herself; her lack of contribution towards the marriage, etc. would be more appropriate at the eventual ancillary matters hearing.
