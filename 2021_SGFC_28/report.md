Ancillary Matters – Custody – Care and Control – Access – Division – Undischarged Bankrupt – Maintenance for Children – Wife Maintenance

12 March 2021

### District Judge Suzanne Chin:

## Introduction

1       The plaintiff (“the Husband”) and the defendant (“the Wife”) were married on 27 September 1994 in Singapore. They have 4 children, two sons who are over the age of 21 and twins, a girl and a boy who at the time of the hearing were 16 years of age.

2       The Husband commenced divorce proceedings on 24 August 2018 citing grounds of unreasonable behaviour on the part of the Wife. The Wife filed a defence and counterclaim on the grounds of unreasonable behaviour on the part of the Husband. While parties initially were unable to agree to the grounds of divorce and were preparing to proceed on a contested basis, they eventually agreed to proceed on an uncontested basis on the counterclaim and on 24 June 2019, Interim Judgement was granted. This was a long marriage which had lasted for close to 25 years.

3       The matter came before me for hearing of the Ancillary Matters. At the time of the hearing, the Husband, a retiree, was 67 years of age and was an undischarged bankrupt. He had been declared a bankrupt towards the end of 2016 prior to the granting of the Interim Judgement. The Wife was 53 years of age and worked as an office manager.

4       After the Ancillary Matters hearing, I made orders relating to the Custody, Care and Control and Access for the 2 minor children granting sole custody and care and control of the 2 children to the Wife, with reasonable access to the Husband. With regard to the division of the matrimonial property I made orders to effect the division of the matrimonial pool in the ratio of 60:40 in favour of the Wife. For maintenance for the 2 minor children, I ordered that the Husband was to pay a monthly sum of $400 for each of the 2 minor children. Finally, I ordered that no Wife maintenance was to be paid by the Husband to the Wife.

5       The Wife has filed an appeal against my orders relating to division of matrimonial property and the maintenance of the 2 younger children and I now set forth the reasons for my decision in relation to the division of matrimonial property, maintenance for the wife and the maintenance for the children.

## Division of Matrimonial Property

#### Effect of the Husband’s Bankruptcy

6       As a preliminary issue, I considered the effect of the Husband’s Bankruptcy on the division of matrimonial property. In the case of _AVM v AWH_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 194</span> _(“AVM v AWH”)_, the High Court referred to two consequences of a party to matrimonial proceedings being adjudged to be bankrupt:

> “\[109\]    First, under s 76(1)(c) of the Bankruptcy Act, a statutory moratorium remedy, action or proceedings against him in respect of any debt provable in his bankruptcy. Second, under s 76(1)(a) of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed) (“Bankruptcy Act”), the husband’s property vested in the Official Assignee immediately and became divisible amongst his creditors, subject only to the exceptions set out in s 78(2) of the Bankruptcy Act….”

The High Court made the following additional observations:

> “\[112\]    Where a spouse is adjudged bankrupt before the matrimonial assets can be divided under s 112 of the Women’s Charter, the bankruptcy creates a fundamental difficulty. The vesting of the bankrupt spouse’s assets in the Official Assignee under s 76(1)(c) of the Bankruptcy Act prevents a court which is exercising matrimonial jurisdiction from making any order under s 112 which affects the vested assets.”

> \[116\] With respect to assets which have vested in the Official Assignee, the most that a court can do under s 112 of the Women’s Charter is to take the value of those divested assets into account by notionally adding them back to the pool of matrimonial assets and dividing the enlarged pool in accordance with s 112, but without encroaching on the assets vested in the Official Assignee….”

A non-bankrupt spouse who seeks a transfer of assets which have vested in the Official Assignee under s 76(1)(a) of the Bankruptcy Act must first effect a re-vesting of those assets in the bankrupt spouse by securing the annulment of the bankruptcy order.

7       With these principles in mind, I noted that in identifying the matrimonial pool, assets of the Husband which had been vested in the Official Assignee were to be notionally added back into the pool and the enlarged pool divided in accordance with the relevant principles. On this basis, I proceeded to determine the assets that fell within the matrimonial pool.

#### Identification of Matrimonial pool

8       As a general position, all matrimonial assets and liabilities should be identified at the time of the Interim Judgement (IJ) and valued at the time of the ancillary matters hearing. For monies in bank accounts and CPF accounts, their values are to be taken at the time of the IJ, as the matrimonial assets are the moneys and not the bank and CPF accounts themselves. Thus, in general, available values as close to the Ancillary Matters hearing should be used (_BUX v BUY_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHCF 4</span>).

9       The parties in this case through counsel agreed that the date of the IJ should be considered for the determination of assets that fell within the matrimonial pool. Applying this, the matrimonial assets belonging to the Husband comprised of his CPF monies as well as an amount of cash held by the Official Assignee. For the Wife, it was not disputed that she held CPF monies as well as cash in various bank accounts. As the only assets held by each party was cash and CPF monies, it was not disputed that the values closest to the date of the Interim Judgement should be utilised.

10     In addition to each party’s assets, the parties had at the time of the Interim Judgement jointly owned the matrimonial home. This was sold sometime in December 2019 and after the sale, the net proceeds amounting to $814,184 had been divided equally between the parties. The relevant amounts withdrawn from their respective CPF accounts for the purchase of the matrimonial property together with interest outstanding had been refunded into each of their CPF accounts. In the case of the Husband, the balance of his share was paid in cash to the Official Assignee. With regard to the Wife, interest incurred on the outstanding housing loan and term loan taken over the matrimonial property following the date of the Husband’s bankruptcy in 2016 was deducted from her half share of the net proceeds together with amounts for her outstanding credit card and cashline payments. The remaining balance was paid to her in cash. This was reflected in the completion statements prepared by the relevant conveyancing solicitors[^1].

11     For the purposes of determining the matrimonial pool however, I included the entire amount of the net sale proceeds of the matrimonial property prior to equal apportionment and refund into each parties CPF accounts. As all interest on any loans should have been payable by both parties, I deducted the amounts for the post-bankruptcy housing loan interest ($90,677) and the post-bankruptcy term loan ($14,941) from the net sale proceeds of the matrimonial property but declined to deduct the amounts relating to the outstanding credit card and cashline in light of the fact that no evidence was provided by the Wife to indicate what these related to. I then attribute the resulting sum of $708,566 as the net value of the proceeds from the sale of the matrimonial home.

12     In addition to the above referenced assets, I considered the parties’ liabilities. It was not disputed that when the family car was sold, there remained an outstanding debt of $59,630 owed to the relevant hire purchase company. While the car had been registered in the name of the Wife, it was undisputed that this had been used as a family car and accordingly, for the purposes of determining the pool, it was agreed by the parties through counsel at the hearing of the ancillary matters that this debt would be shared equally between them. This accordingly was factored into the value for the matrimonial pool.

13     The table below provides a summary of the assets and liabilities the matrimonial pool as well as their values:

14     In addition to the above, the Husband also referred to various miscellaneous items which he claimed he had left behind in the matrimonial flat when he left in 2016 and he wanted the Wife to account for this. As he was not able to provide any evidence of this, I declined to take all of these items into consideration in arriving at the matrimonial pool.

15     The Husband also referred to the license plate for the family car which had been sold at the time of the sale of the car. The Husband maintained that this held a value of $40,000 and he wished to have this added back into the pool. While the Wife did not appear to challenge the Husband’s position on the value of $40,000 as well as the fact that the car license plate belonged to the Husband, she maintained that she had used the monies from the sale of this for maintenance for the family. In light of this, I decided not to add this amount back into the pool but to factor this amount as part of the Husband’s contributions towards the maintenance of the family.

## The relevant approach to be applied for the division of matrimonial assets

16     The parties agreed through counsel that the structured approach in _ANJ v ANJ_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span> applied to the division of matrimonial assets in this case. This was a dual income long marriage of 25 years where both parties worked throughout the marriage. This structured approach was summarised in _TIT v TIU_ and another appeal <span class="citation">\[2016\] 3 SLR 1137</span> at \[21\]:

> (a)    express as a ratio the parties’ direct contributions relative to each other, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets \[(“Step 1”)\];

> (b)    express as a second ratio the parties’ indirect contributions relative to each other, having regard to both financial and nonfinancial contributions \[(“Step 2”)\]; and

> (c)    derive the parties’ overall contributions relative to each other by taking an average of the two ratios above (the derived ratio shall be referred to as “the average ratio”), keeping in mind that, depending on the circumstances of each case, the direct and indirect contributions may not be accorded equal weight, and one of the two ratios may be accorded more significance than the other. Adjustments could also be made in respect of other relevant factors under s 112 or s 114(1) of the \[WC\] \[(“Step 3”)\].

## Step 1: Direct Contributions

17     In order to determine each parties’ direct contributions to the matrimonial pool, I proceeded to determine each parties’ direct contribution towards the matrimonial property. Contributions made by each party to the matrimonial property took the form of CPF monies and cash contributions. The amounts contributed by each of the parties from their CPF accounts was undisputed with the Husband having contributed a principle sum of $154,135 and the Wife having contributed a principle sum of $214,324. It was also not disputed that the Husband had made cash contributions amounting to a sum of $324,000.

18     What was disputed was the amount of cash contributions that the Wife had made towards the matrimonial home. According to the Wife, she claimed to have contributed a sum of $100,530 from January 2016 to December 2018. She informed the court that she was unable to determine the amount of cash payments made from October 2015 to December 2015[^2] and accordingly I did not take this into consideration. While the Wife conceded to having used rental monies to make payments in 2018, it was her position that she had borrowed money from her father for payments in 2016 and 2017. The Husband disputed this and contended that after he had moved out of the matrimonial home in 2016, she had proceeded to rent out the matrimonial home. This was denied by the Wife. Upon examination of the Wife’s Affidavit of Evidence in Chief filed in relation to the divorce which the Wife maintained was an accurate account of the marriage, I noted that the Wife had stated that she had no choice but to move out of the matrimonial home as she had been unable to pay for the mortgage on the property purely on her salary[^3]. This leads me to infer that she moved out and proceeded to rent out the property to help her pay for the mortgage on the matrimonial home. My inference that the matrimonial home was in fact rented out from 2016 was further buttressed by the fact that in the Wife’s notice in response to the Husband’s request for discovery[^4], she had indicated that she would be providing by letter, copies of tenancy agreements for the matrimonial home from 2016 to December 2018. While these were never provided by her, her response to the request for discovery was clearly an acknowledgement that the tenancies did in fact exist from 2016 to 2018. Taking all things into consideration and factoring a monthly rental of $4,500 for the 3-year period, total rental collected from the matrimonial property amounted to $162,000. Bearing in mind the fact that any rental collected should be equally attributed to the parties, I attributed half of this sum as the Wife’s cash contribution i.e. $81,000 towards the matrimonial property with the balance of $19,520 as having been contributed by the Husband.

19     Taking into consideration all of the above, I arrived at a direct contribution ratio towards the matrimonial property of 62:38 in favour of the Husband. After factoring the assets that each party held in their own names, this led me to reach an overall direct contribution ratio of 50:50.

## Indirect Contributions

20     In determining the appropriate ratio to be applied for indirect contributions, I found the observations of the Court of Appeal in the recent case of _USB v USA_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 57</span> at \[43\] pertinent:

>     “In our judgment, the broad-brush approach should be applied with particular vigour in assessing the parties’ _indirect_ contributions. This would serve the purpose of discouraging needless acrimony during the ancillary proceedings. Practically, this means that, in ascertaining the ratio of indirect contributions, the court should not focus unduly on the minutiae of family life. Instead, the court should direct its attention to broad factual indicators when determining the ratio of parties’ indirect contributions. These would include factors such as the length of the marriage, the number of children, and which party was the children’s primary caregiver.”

21     I proceeded to consider the facts of the present case in light of this philosophical approach. This was a marriage that lasted for 25 years, with 4 children, 2 already adults and the remaining 2 not far from adulthood. The parties had lived together until 2016 when the Husband left the family and shortly thereafter left Singapore altogether.

22     With regard to indirect financial contributions, it was not disputed that the Husband had made the bulk of all indirect financial contributions paying for the family and household expenses before 2016. This was for 21 years of a 25-year marriage. After the Husband left the family in 2016, for the remaining 4 years, while he did not directly pay for the family expenses, I found that he had made contributions. In this regard, the Wife had stated that she had used the balance of rental proceeds from the matrimonial home from the matrimonial home as well as the sales proceeds of the car license plate for the family car to pay for the expenses. As the Wife had used her share of rental proceeds for payment of the mortgage and this had been factored in as part of her direct contributions towards the matrimonial home, I considered that the balance of the rental proceeds largely came from the Husband’s share of the rental proceeds. Additionally, as the Wife had earlier conceded that the car licence plate belonged to the Husband, this too was factored in as part of the Husband’s indirect financial contributions over the period from early 2016 till the date of the Interim Judgement in 2019.

23     In terms of indirect non-financial contributions, I relied on the Wife’s counterclaim which was uncontested and accordingly accepted by the Husband. Based on this, I reached the conclusion that while the Husband had made the lion’s share of indirect financial contributions for the period prior to 2016, the indirect non-financial contributions were largely made by the Wife. The evidence showed that the Husband had moved out of the matrimonial home even before 2016 and it was likely that upon his departure from the matrimonial home, it fell upon the Wife to take care of the majority of the indirect non-financial contributions.

24     Taking all of this into consideration and applying a broad-brush approach, I determined that the appropriate ratio to be applied for indirect contributions would be 60:40 in favour of the Wife. The parties were agreeable to using the average ratio between direct and indirect contributions and in applying this, I determined that the matrimonial pool should be divided in the ratio of 45:55 in favour of the Wife.

## Adjustments and Adverse Inference

25     Each of the parties put forward their requests for the Court to draw and adverse inference against the other.

#### The Law on Adverse Inference

26     The High Court in _TIT v TIU_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHCF 8</span> noted as follows:

>     “\[31\] As noted by the Court of Appeal in _BG v BF_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 3 SLR(R) 233</span> (“_BG v BF_”), at \[52\], the general duty owed by parties to the court to “make full and frank disclosure of all relevant information within his or her knowledge \[,\] is particularly relevant in the context of the division of matrimonial assets.” The absence of full and frank disclosure would entitle the court to draw a suitable adverse inference.”

27     In _Chan Tin Sun v Fong Quay Sim_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 2 SLR 195</span>, the Court of Appeal at \[62\] referred to the decision of _Koh Bee Choo v Choo Chai Huah_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] SGCA 21</span> on drawing of adverse inferences:

>     “In order for the court to draw an adverse inference, there must be:

>> (a)    a substratum of evidence that establishes a prima facie case against the person against whom the inference is to be drawn; and

>> (b)    that person must have had some particular access to the information he is said to be hiding.”

The Court of Appeal set forth 2 alternative approaches in giving effect to the adverse inference:

> “\[64\] There are at least two alternative approaches to give effect to the adverse inference drawn against a spouse, both of which have been endorsed by this court: see _NK v NL_ at \[61\] – \[62\]. The first approach is for the court to make a finding of the value of the undisclosed assets on the available evidence and for the party dissatisfied with the value attributed to show that it is unreasonable; if the dissatisfied party is unable to do so, the value is then included in the matrimonial pool for division (see, for example, the Singapore High Court decision of _Tay Sin Tor v Tay Chay Eng_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 2 SLR(R) 385</span> at \[18\]). Although it endorsed this approach, the court in _NK v NL_ also cautioned against “unnecessary speculation with respect to the specific values of undeclared assets” and instead held (at \[62\]) that in the circumstances of the case, “it might be more just and equitable (not to mention, practical) to order a higher proportion of the known assets to be given to the wife.”

#### Adverse Inference against the Wife

28     The Husband claimed that the Wife had been withdrawing huge amounts of money from her HSBC account and this amounted to dissipation of funds by the Wife. It was the Husband’s case that the Wife had siphoned moneys from this account into a separate account, which she had failed to make full and frank disclosure of. In light of this, the Husband wanted the Court to draw an adverse inference against the Wife.

29     Upon examination of the bank accounts, I did not accept that there was dissipation. The Wife was merely withdrawing her salary of $5,000 each month and bearing in mind she had herself and the children to maintain, I did not think that this was out of the ordinary.

30     The Husband also pointed out that the Wife had failed to disclose one of her insurance policies. The Wife claimed not to know anything about the policy even though her bank account statement[^5] clearly showed that payment had been made. The Wife also claimed that she had called the relevant insurance company and was informed by them that they did not know anything about this. Unfortunately, other than her bare assertion, no evidence was provided by her to support her contentions. Bearing this in mind, I determined that the Husband had successfully provided the necessary substratum of evidence to establish a _prima facie_ case against the Wife who had access to the information relating to the said insurance policy. Accordingly, I found that the Wife had not in fact made full and frank disclosure of all of her assets and that an adverse inference should be drawn against her.

#### Adverse Inference against the Husband

31     The Wife wanted the court to draw an adverse inference against him citing his failure to make full and frank disclose of his income and assets. In this regard she provided copies of various document which included his linked in pages, company searches, which showed that he held positions of General Manager from October 2013 to January 2019 and from January 2019 onwards, Director and Trainer of various companies and groups[^6]. The Husband argued that the companies referred to were loss making companies without value. He also claimed that he had allowed the use of his name as a favour to a friend and that he had never received any director’s fees[^7]. Upon examination of all of the evidence before me, I did not find the Husband’s position believable. His account that he had tried to find employment without result was clearly in contradiction to what had been reflected in his Linked In profile and if indeed he had really never held these positions, he should not have included this in his Linked In profile and made these representations. I accordingly arrived at the conclusion that the Husband had not made the necessary full and frank disclosure as was required by him and considered it appropriate for an adverse inference to be drawn against him.

## Just and equitable division

32     I proceeded to draw an adverse inference against both parties and after taking into consideration the adjustment to be made in respect of the adverse inference to be drawn against each of them and also taking into consideration the needs of the children, my final decision was that the matrimonial pool should be divided in the ratio of 60:40 in favour of the Wife.

33     The Wife’s share of the total matrimonial pool was $530,702. After taking into account the value of assets held in her own name ($164,834), the monies refunded into her CPF account ($266,631) as well as the cash she had received previously at the time of the sale of the matrimonial home ($19,431), I found that a balance of $64,400 remained. Bearing in mind that the only assets available for division were the Husband’s CPF monies, I ordered that this sum should be transferred from the Husband’s CPF Ordinary Account into the Wife’s Ordinary Account.

## Children’s Maintenance

34     The Wife claimed reasonable expenses of $1,000 per month for each of the 2 children under the age of 21 years of age. She wanted the court to consider making an order for a lump sum payment for the children’s maintenance taking into account these expenses up to the time when they turned 21. Based on her calculations the total amount of maintenance for the children who are both currently 16 years old will come up to a total sum of $228,000. She contended that the Husband should bear half of this and hence a lump sum of $114,000 should be transferred from the Husband’s CPF account to her.

35     The Husband did not appear to put forward a position on the children’s reasonable expenses but was more focussed on the percentage of their expenses that he should bear. He maintained that based on the monies he gets from his pension his income is only 15% of her income.

36     The law on children’s maintenance is clear. S 68 of the Women’s Charter states that it shall be the duty of a parent to maintain or contribute to the maintenance of his or her children, whether they are in his or her custody or the custody of the other person, either by providing them with such accommodation, clothing, food and education as may be reasonable having regard to his or her means and station in life. The duty to maintain a child is therefore imposed on both parents. As such, in determining the amount each parent has to pay, the court must first determine what are the reasonable expenses for the children and then determine in what proportions each parent should contribute to the expenses of the children. I would mention at the outset that under the relevant CPF rules, it is clear that CPF monies cannot be used to pay maintenance and a court is not able to order that a lumpsum amount be paid from the Husband’s CPF monies as maintenance for the children.

37     I turned first to look at the expenses of the children. As the Wife had put forward a sum of $1,000 for each child and the Husband had not put forward a position, I accepted the Wife’s position of $1,000 a month for each of the children’s expenses.

38     I next turned to look at the salaries, expenses and earning capacities of each of the parties. The Wife declared a monthly salary of $7,840 with a take home of $6,640. This was disputed by the Husband who pointed out that based on her Notice of Assessment for year of assessment in 2019, her monthly earnings were closer to a sum of $8,800[^8]. While I considered this, I also noted that her income varied from year to year and accepted the Wife’s declared monthly salary of $7,840.31.The Husband maintained that he had retired and was not working. He also claimed that his only source of income was the pension that he received from the UK in a sum of $1,180. In light of this, he contended that he should only be ordered to bear 15% of the children’s expenses while Wife wanted the Husband to bear 50% of the children’s expenses.

39     I took into consideration the salaries and earning capacities of the parties, their ages as well as the assets held in their names and considered that it would be fair for the Husband to bear 40% of the children’s expenses going forward. Accordingly, I ordered that with effect from 1 January 2020, the Husband was to pay a monthly maintenance of $400 for each of the two children, a total of $800 per month.

## Wife Maintenance

40     The Wife’s position on maintenance was less clear. On the one hand, her written submissions did not clearly indicate that she was requesting for maintenance. During the hearing, through counsel she informed the court that she would not be making any request for maintenance if the court orders that the amount she had requested for was transferred from the Husband’s CPF account to her.

41     Notwithstanding the above, I considered the position on maintenance for the Wife. The law is trite in this area. In _Foo Ah Yan v Chiam Heng Chow_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGCA 15</span>, the Court of Appeal also held that:

>     “**As the power to order maintenance is supplementary to the power to order division of matrimonial assets, courts regularly take into account each party’s share of the matrimonial assets when assessing the appropriate quantum to be ordered**: see, for example, _BG v BF_ (\[15\]) _supra_) at \[75\] - \[76\], _Rosaline Singh_ (\[18\]) _supra_) at \[13\]; _Tan Bee Giok_ at \[27\] and _AQS_ (\[19\]) _supra_) at \[51\]). Indeed, this inquiry falls within the matters to be considered under s 114(1)(a) of the Act…”

>     \[_Emphasis added_\]

It is as such settled that the order for a husband to provide maintenance to his former wife is supplementary to the order to divide their matrimonial assets (_ATE v ATD_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGCA 2</span>) and is intended to even out any residual financial inequality. Given my decision on the division of the matrimonial assets. I did not find that there were any financial inequalities to be evened out. I also noted that the Wife has been working all this time and is clearly capable of maintaining herself. In light of this, I did not make any orders for wife maintenance to be paid.

## Conclusion

42     After having carefully considered the evidence and submissions of the parties, I arrived at what I considered to be the just and equitable orders in relation to the division of assets of assets and the children’s maintenance. My orders on each of these were as follows:

> _B_.     _Division of Matrimonial Property_
