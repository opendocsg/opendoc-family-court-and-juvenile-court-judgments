Family Law – Maintenance for Wife; Division of matrimonial assets including matrimonial property; Costs

28 February 2019

### District Judge Christine Lee:

### Introduction

1       The present appeal is by the Husband against the parts of the Court’s decision made on 15 November 2018 regarding the maintenance payable for the Wife, division of the matrimonial assets including the matrimonial property and costs payable by the Husband.

### Background

2       The Plaintiff Husband (“the Appellant Husband”) and Defendant Wife (“the Respondent Wife”) married on xx xxx 2012 in Singapore. There are no children of the marriage. The marriage lasted about 4 years before the Appellant Husband filed Writ of Divorce on 8 November 2016. However, the Parties had lived apart since May 2013 (about 6 months after their marriage) when the Appellant Husband moved out of the matrimonial home.

3       This matter was set down on an uncontested basis based on both the Statement of Claim and Counterclaim (Amendment No 1 dated 8 May 2017) after the Defence and Reply to Defence and Counterclaim were withdrawn on 17 April 2017.

4       Interim Judgement (IJ) was therefore granted on 15 May 2017 based on the fact that the Appellant Husband had sufficiently proven the contents of the Statement of Claim and the Respondent Wife had sufficiently proven the contents of the Counterclaim (Amendment No 1 dated 8 May 2017) and the marriage was dissolved by reason that the Respondent Wife had behaved in such a way that the Appellant Husband could not reasonably be expected to live with the Respondent Wife and that the Appellant Husband had behaved in such a way that the Respondent Wife could not reasonably be expected to live with the Appellant Husband.

### Hearings before the Court

5       The Court dealt with the Ancillary Matters (AM) of this case on three (3) hearing days namely, 14 June 2018, 16 August 2018 and 4 October 2018 and adjourned the matter for decision. According to the Statement of Claim and Counterclaim (Amendment No 1 dated 8 May 2017), there were 5 AMs to be decided by the Court.

6       These were:

a.     Division of the Matrimonial Home;

b.     Division of the Matrimonial Assets;

c.     Maintenance for the Wife;

d.     Costs and

e.     Other Relief

7       After the conclusion of AM hearings, the Court delivered its decision on all 5 AMs on 15 November 2018.

8       The Appellant Husband filed Notice of Appeal on 28 November 2018 in HCF/DCA 145/2018 against those parts of the Court’s decision regarding the issues of maintenance for the Respondent Wife, division of the matrimonial assets including the matrimonial property and costs payable by the Appellant Husband in the Court Order (“the said Court Order”) made on 15 November 2018.

### The Appeal

9       The Appellant Husband is appealing against five (5) paragraphs of the said Court Order as follows:

**Paragraph 1 of the said Court Order:**

**Maintenance for the Defendant**

1.    In full and final settlement of the Defendant’s claims against the Plaintiff for maintenance, the Plaintiff is to make payment of a lump sum of $48,000 to the Defendant within six (6) months of the date of this Order.

**Paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of the said Court Order:**

Division of matrimonial assets including the matrimonial property

2.    The total value in the pool of matrimonial assets to be apportioned is assessed at **$806,278.61** inclusive of the net value of the matrimonial home at xxx (“the matrimonial property”)**.**

3.    The Parties’ share of **$806,278.61** is apportioned at **62%** to the Plaintiff and **38%** to the Defendant.

4.    In full and final settlement of the Defendant’s claims against the Plaintiff for division of the matrimonial assets including the matrimonial property, the Plaintiff is to make payment of a lump sum of $36,000 to the Defendant within six (6) months of the date of this Order.

**Paragraph 9 of the said Court Order** **:**

**Costs of these proceedings**

9.    The Plaintiff is to pay the sum of $3,000 including disbursements, towards the Defendant’s costs of these ancillary matters proceedings.

### Summary of the Court’s reasons for making its Order

10     In essence, the Appellant Husband’s appeal is based on three issues (i) payment of maintenance to the Respondent Wife (ii) division of the matrimonial assets including the matrimonial property and (iii) costs awarded against the Appellant Husband.

## Payment of maintenance to the Respondent Wife

11     The Court looked at the totality of the ancillary matters before considering the issue of whether maintenance for the Respondent Wife was appropriate.

12     The Court’s assessment of the facts was that although this was a short childless marriage, the Appellant Husband, through his own admissions,[^1] confirmed that he had been paying for the Respondent Wife’s personal debts, loans, credit card bills and other expenses from the time of their marriage and continued to do so even after he left the matrimonial home in May 2013, until February 2014 when he was advised by his lawyers. The Court accepted the Respondent Wife’s Counsel’s submission that because of this, the Respondent Wife had relied on the Appellant Husband to pay for her maintenance until he stopped paying for her expenses after February 2014.

13     In addition, when the Appellant Husband left the matrimonial home after six (6) months of marriage, the Respondent Wife continued to take care of the matrimonial home since May 2013 to-date.

14     As it was raised in the Appellant Husband’s submissions, the Court also looked into the Respondent Wife’s previous application for interim maintenance in MSS xxxx/2014 where no order was made. The records showed that this application was dismissed on 15 August 2014 because the learned District Judge’s assessment was that as it was a short marriage as at the time of the application, and as the Respondent Wife was working, it was not the appropriate time to apply for maintenance.

15     In making its final assessment, the Court also discounted the fact that the Respondent Wife had accumulated liabilities worth $81,567.35 as these were her credit card payments and were of her own making. The Court agreed with the Respondent Wife’s Counsel’s submissions, relying on the case of **_Tan Yen Chuan vs Lim Theam Siew at para 74_**, that “_if the Wife is able to show reliance or that the Husband has been providing for the Wife, then there cannot be any order for no maintenance_”.

16     The Court also noted that there was a substantial income disparity between the Parties although the Respondent Wife’s income was disputed. However, the Court agreed with the Respondent Wife’s Counsel’s submission that the Appellant Husband’s income was about 4 times that of the Respondent Wife’s income.

17     The Court then took guidance from the case of **_TNL v TNK_** , whereby the Court of Appeal (CA) reiterated that “_the Court’s power to order maintenance is supplementary to its power to order a division of matrimonial assets”._ The CA went on to say that “_consequently, if, from the division of matrimonial assets, there is a sum which, if invested properly, would be sufficient to maintain the wife, the award of maintenance should be no more than what is necessary to allow the wife to weather the transition of divorce_”.

18     After taking into consideration the division of matrimonial assets in this case, the income disparity between the Parties, the circumstances of this case and the fact that it was a short childless marriage, the Court was of the view that the sum of $4,000 for a period of 12 months was reasonable and necessary to allow the Respondent Wife to get back on her feet financially after the divorce. The Court was also of the view that this should be paid in a lump sum of $48,000 to the Respondent Wife and ordered accordingly.

## Division of the matrimonial assets including the matrimonial property

19     In making its decision on the division of the matrimonial assets including the matrimonial property, the Court was of the view that there should be a global assessment for this division. This was because the Court’s assessment that a separate percentage ratio assessment based on the matrimonial home alone, was not a fair option to both Parties. Therefore, the Court went through the list of assets provided by the Parties.

##### Appellant Husband’s Assets

20     In relation to the Appellant Husband’s assets, the Court noted that there was agreement on the assets comprising S/Ns 1 to 12 of the list given in his AM Fact and Position Sheet (FPS). There was also agreement that S/Ns 13 to 16 should be excluded. The dispute was with regard to the values attributed to S/Ns 17 to 20 and whether these assets should form part of the matrimonial pool.

21     The list of the Appellant Husband’s assets as given in his FPS and the Respondent Wife’s corresponding amounts as at the date closest to the IJ date of 15 May 2017 were as follows:

22     Therefore, based on the Appellant Husband’s FPS, the total value of the Appellant Husband’s assets to go into the matrimonial pool as ascribed above, was **$523,571.28** being the addition of S/Ns 1 to 12 + S/N 17+ S/N 20 and minus the negative values in S/Ns 18 and 19**.**

23     In this regard, the Court agreed with the Respondent Wife’s Counsel that the appropriate formula to ascertain the value of the Appellant Husband’s shares was as set out in the case of **_TVJ vs TVK_** . Using this formula, the Court agreed with the Respondent Wife’s Counsel’s valuation of the Appellant Husband’s shares in S/Ns 17 and 20 as set out above. The Court also agreed with the Respondent Wife’s Counsel’s attribution of nil value to the Appellant Husband’s shares in S/Ns 18 and 19.

24     The key issue of dispute was whether the Appellant Husband’s shares in S/N 17 namely, the 90,002 shares in xxx Co Pte Ltd, should form part of the total matrimonial pool. There was no dispute regarding the Appellant Husband’s shares in S/N 20 (being the 5 shares in xxx Singapore Pte Ltd) as being part of the matrimonial pool.

25     With regard to the Appellant Husband’s 90,002 shares in xxx Co Pte Ltd, the Appellant Husband’s Counsel submitted that this was a gift from the Appellant Husband’s late father and produced a Statutory Declaration (SD) dated 24 September 2018 attesting to this. However, this SD was only produced at the final AM hearing on 4 October 2018.

26     The Court considered the Respondent Wife’s Counsel’s submissions that this SD was self-serving and that as the Appellant Husband had never raised the issue of gift in any of his Affidavits, that no or less weight, should be given to this SD. In addition, the Respondent Wife’s Counsel submitted that there was no Deed of Gift from the Appellant Husband’s father and that the shares had been transferred to the Appellant Husband by way of a nominal $1.00 payment.

27     However, the Court did not view the share transfer method of these shares as being detrimental to the Appellant Husband’s case. More importantly in the Court’s view, the timing of the transfer was crucial. The Court noted that it was the Appellant Husband’s case that the shares had been transferred in 2014 before the Appellant Husband’s father passed away.

28     The Court also noted that there were two documents attached to the SD which showed that the transfer of these shares had been made in 2014. These were: (a) the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore Certificate of Stamp Duty dated 21 January 2014 and (b) Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) business search report that showed that the Appellant Husband was the owner of the 90,002 shares by 19 February 2014.

29     As such, the Court took guidance from the Court of Appeal’s decision in **_Wan Lai Cheng vs Quek Seow Kee_** that “_all gifts and inheritances received from third parties before and during a marriage (not being the matrimonial home) are not part of the matrimonial assets unless the substantial improvement exception in s.112(10) of the Women’s Charter is satisfied.”_

30     Accordingly, the Court decided that the Appellant Husband’s shares in S/N 17 namely, the 90,002 shares in xxx Co Pte Ltd, were to be excluded from the matrimonial pool but the Appellant Husband’s 5 shares in S/N 20 in xxx Singapore Pte Ltd, were to form part of the total matrimonial pool.

31     In the Court’s final assessment, the total value of the Appellant Husband’s assets that were part of the matrimonial pool was the sum of **$326,712.35** derived as follows:

32     The Court notes that its final assessment of the total value of the Appellant Husband’s assets that should go into the matrimonial pool in the sum of $326,712.35, is much less than the total value of the Appellant Husband’s assets listed in his FPS for the matrimonial pool in the sum of $523,571.28 (see paragraph 22 above). The difference being in the Appellant Husband’s favour, in the amount of $196,858.93.

##### Respondent Wife’s Assets

33     The Court noted that the Appellant Husband’s Counsel had agreed with the Respondent Wife’s Counsel that the Respondent Wife’s assets that were to form part of the matrimonial pool was in the sum of $270,400.59.

34     However, the Court was of the view that the total value of the Respondent Wife’s assets should exclude the monies in the OCBC Account No xxx as this was jointly held with a 3rd party (LGT). In addition, the amount in this account (being $47.01) was minimal.

35     As such, the Court’s final assessment of the total value of the Respondent Wife’s assets was as follows:

36     Therefore, the final sum of the total value of the Respondent’s Wife’s assets to go into the matrimonial pool was **$270,353.58.**

##### Joint Asset

37     The Matrimonial Home was property at xxx. The Court noted that there was agreement as to the final value of the matrimonial home being in the sum of **$209,212.68** at the agreed estimated value of $600,000 less the outstanding housing loan of $390,787.32.

38     Accordingly, the Court’s final assessment of the total value of the assets for the matrimonial pool to be divided was:

i.     The Parties’ Joint Asset being the Matrimonial Home at xxx in the net value of **$209,212.68;**

ii.     The Court’s assessment of the total value of the Respondent Wife’s assets at **$270,353.58;** and

iii.     The Court’s assessment of the total value of the Appellant Husband’s assets at **$326,712.35.**

39     Hence, the Court’s assessment of the total amount for the matrimonial pool was **$806,278.61.**

## Division of the matrimonial home

40     As earlier stated, the Court was of the view that the most equitable division of the Parties respective shares was by global assessment of the pool of matrimonial assets. To this end, the Court agreed with the Respondent Wife’s Counsel that the percentage ratio should be based on the ratio attributed to the division of the Matrimonial Home.

41     The Appellant Husband’s Counsel relied on the CA case of **_Ong Boon Huat Samuel vs Chan Mei Lan Kristine_** whereby the CA stated that for short childless marriages, the division of matrimonial assets would usually be direct contributions only.

42     There was much dispute over the sum of $79,500 as being part of the Respondent Wife’s direct contributions. The Appellant Husband admitted that he paid the Respondent Wife this sum but disputed that it was an inter-spousal gift. The Court noted the Respondent Wife’s Counsel’s submission that the Appellant Husband did not mention this sum until after the Respondent Wife claimed this amount as being part of her direct contributions towards the purchase of the matrimonial home. The Court was also referred to the case of **_TNL vs TNK at para 19_** on the co-mingling of funds.

43     The Court was of the view that the circumstances of the present case allowed the Court some flexibility regarding its assessment of the Direct and Indirect contributions of the Parties. Using the reasoning applied in the CA’s decision in **_Wan Lai Cheng vs Quek Seow Kee \[ibid\]_**, the Court was of the view that inter-spousal gifts could be included as part of matrimonial assets. As such, the Court’s assessment was that the disputed sum of $79,500 formed part of the Respondent Wife’s direct contributions for the matrimonial home.

44     The Court took into account the Appellant Husband’s Counsel’s submission that the Respondent Wife had been enjoying sole and rent free occupation of the matrimonial home since 2013 and that she had been running a business from the matrimonial home. The Appellant Husband’s Counsel also submitted that the Respondent Wife had also allowed her grandmother to stay in the matrimonial home rent free and was renting out rooms in the matrimonial home.

45     The Court also took note of the Respondent Wife's Counsel’s submission that the converse also applied in that after the Appellant Husband had moved out of the matrimonial home, the Respondent Wife had been taking care of the matrimonial home since May 2013 and that she had paid the utility bills and conservancy bills whilst the Appellant Husband continued to pay the mortgage and property tax.

46     The Respondent Wife's Counsel also submitted that adverse inference should be drawn against the Appellant Husband for failure to disclose his income as director of the 2 companies (xxx Co Pte Ltd and xxx Singapore Pte Ltd – S/Ns 17 and 20 of the Appellant Husband’s list of assets). In particular, the Court noted that the Appellant Husband’s 90,002 shares in xxx Co Pte Ltd would have been a substantial addition to the total pool of matrimonial assets had the Court not excluded it by accepting the Appellant Husband’s late submission of his SD.

47     The Court also took into account the Appellant Husband’s request that he be allowed to retain the matrimonial home and provided for the transfer of the Respondent Wife's rights in the matrimonial home other than by way of sale, to the Appellant Husband, as both Parties were listed as the joint owners of the matrimonial home.

48     The Court noted that the Parties married on xx xxx 2012 and that the matrimonial home was purchased on xxx 2013 with the Parties moving in soon thereafter. However, in May 2013, the Appellant Husband moved out of the matrimonial home and the Respondent Wife took care of maintaining and up keeping the matrimonial home from 2013 to-date. As such, the Court allotted a higher percentage to the Respondent Wife for her indirect contributions towards the matrimonial home.

49     The Court’s assessment of the percentage division ratio that should be allotted to the Appellant Husband was 62% with 38% to the Respondent Wife. The details for this allotment are as follows:

50     The Court then calculated that based on the Respondent Wife's 38% share of the total matrimonial pool sum of $806,278.61 = $306,385.87 less the total value of her own assets in the pool of $270,353.58 = $36,032.29 rounded down to $36,000 which is the lump sum amount that the Appellant Husband was ordered to pay to the Respondent Wife.

## Costs awarded against the Appellant Husband

51     The Court awarded costs against the Appellant Husband because of the delay and circumstances of the provision of the Appellant Husband’s evidence on the most substantial portion of his assets, namely the 90,002 shares in xxx Co Pte Ltd.

52     The Appellant Husband had filed five (5) Affidavits[^2] for the AM hearing. The Court noted that the Appellant Husband only gave some details on the 90,002 shares in xxx Co Pte Ltd in his 4th Affidavit filed on 19 April 2018. The Court further noted that it was only in the Appellant Husband’s FPS, which was filed on 13 June 2018, that the Appellant Husband attributed the value of $401,900.43 to these 90,002 shares.

53     The Court also noted that from the outset, the Appellant Husband took the position that each party should retain their own assets. It was only at the first AM hearing on 14 June 2018 when the Respondent Wife’s Counsel produced a table indicating that the book value of these 90,002 shares was substantial, that the Appellant Husband’s Counsel asked for time to obtain a valuation of the Appellant Husband’s 90,002 shares.

54     The Court further notes that it was only at the second AM hearing on 16 August 2018 that the Appellant Husband’s Counsel indicated for the first time, that the 90,002 shares were a gift or inheritance but still did not produce any documents to confirm this.

55     It was only at the final AM hearing on 4 October 2018 that the Appellant Husband’s Counsel produced the SD dated 24 September 2018 attesting that these shares were a gift from the Appellant Husband’s late father to the Appellant Husband and that the transfer of these 90,002 shares to the Appellant Husband had been made in 2014.

56     In the Court’s view, since this was a fact known to the Appellant Husband well before the first AM hearing, the Appellant Husband should have produced these documents or stated that these shares were a gift from his late father from the onset. In view of the Appellant Husband’s failure to do so, the Respondent Wife’s Counsel was made to do substantial work to obtain a valuation of these 90,002 shares for the AM hearings.

57     As such, and because the Respondent Wife was granted a lump sum for both her maintenance and for her share in the division of the matrimonial assets, the Respondent Wife’s Counsel asked for the sum of $6,000 as costs.

58     The Court was guided by the case law, in particular, the case of **_JBB vs JBA_** that the costs for ancillary matters proceedings should be awarded on the basis of the conduct of the parties in these proceedings.

59     As such, the Court awarded the sum of $3,000 as costs for the ancillary matters proceedings to the Respondent Wife, inclusive of disbursements.
