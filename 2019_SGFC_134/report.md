Family law – Judgments and orders – Ancillary Matters – Setting aside judgments and orders made in the absence of one party

3 December 2019

### District Judge Michelle Elias Solomon:

## Introduction

1       The parties in these proceedings are husband and wife. The Plaintiff/Wife (“the Wife”) commenced FC/D 4496/2016 on 14 September 2016 against the Defendant/Husband (“the Husband”) seeking a dissolution of the marriage. The Husband and Wife (“the Parties”) have one child who was an adult at the time of the commencement of these proceedings.

2       The Husband did not participate at all in the divorce or ancillary proceedings, and the final order in respect of the ancillary matters (“the Ancillary Order”) was granted, in the Husband’s absence, on 22 March 2017 in the following terms:

> a)     The Defendant shall pay the Plaintiff the sum of $142,800 as lump sum maintenance for the Plaintiff. This sum shall be paid within 6 months of the Final Judgment.

> b)     Within 4 months of the Final Judgment, the matrimonial flat/property at \[xxx\] shall be transferred (other than by way of sale) to the Plaintiff with no CPF refunds to be made to the Defendant's CPF account and no cash consideration to the Defendant. The Plaintiff shall bear the costs of the transfer.

> c)     The Registrar or Assistant Registrar of the Family Justice Courts under section 31 of the Family Justice Act 2014 is empowered to execute, sign, or indorse all necessary documents relating to matters contained in this order on behalf of either party should either party fail to do so within seven days of written request being made to the party.

> d)     Within 4 months of the Final Judgment, the Defendant shall vacate the matrimonial home.

> e)     Each party to retain all other assets in their respective names.

> f)     Costs of the divorce fixed at $2,200, payable by Defendant to Plaintiff. Costs of the ancillary matters fixed at $2,800, payable by Defendant to Plaintiff.

> g)     Liberty to apply.

3       About two years and two months after the Ancillary Order was made, the Husband applied to set the Ancillary Order aside under SUM 1762/2019 (“the setting-aside application”). In the setting-aside application, the Husband also applied to set aside an Order of Court dated 26 July 2018, which was an order extending the time for transfer of the matrimonial home (“the Extension Order”). The terms of the Extension Order read:

> 1.    That the time periods under paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of the Order of Court dated 22 March 2017 be extended as follows:

>> a)    The matrimonial flat/property at \[xxx\] (the “Property”) shall be transferred (other than by way of sale) to Plaintiff with no CPF refunds to be made to Defendant’s CPF account and no cash consideration to Defendant within 4 months of the date of the order given herein. The Plaintiff shall bear the costs of the transfer; and

>> b)    The Registrar or Assistant Registrar of the Family Justice Courts under section 31 of the Family Justice Act 2014 is empowered to execute, sign, or indorse all necessary documents relating to matters contained in this order on behalf of either party should either party fail to do so within seven days of written request being made to the party; and

>> c)    Defendant shall vacate the Property within 4 months of the date of order given herein.

> 2.    That costs of this application fixed at $1,200.00 all-in to be paid by Defendant to Plaintiff.

4       The setting-aside application came up before me for hearing and I granted the order, in part, after considering the Parties’ evidence and submissions. The Husband, being dissatisfied with my decision, filed a Notice of Appeal.

## Background Facts and Previous Proceedings

5       The Parties were married on 18 April 1978 in Singapore. A son was born to them some three years later, on 3 December 1981. The Parties are Singapore citizens. Following the breakdown of the marriage, the Wife left the matrimonial home in September 2016. The Husband continued to reside there until May 2019. The Husband works as an odd-job labourer in the construction industry[^1]. The W has no formal education and is a part-time cleaner[^2].

6       The Husband was served with the writ and supporting documents via an Order of Court for substituted service dated 26 October 2016. Following this, he did not enter an appearance in the proceedings. The Interim Judgment was granted on 29 November 2016, with the ancillary matters adjourned to be heard in chambers.

7       Throughout the proceedings, the Husband was sent Registrar’s Notices (“RNs”) informing him of the date/time of court events. The Husband does not dispute receiving these RNs. The Husband was absent at all court events, including the final ancillary hearing on 22 March 2017 at which the Ancillary Order was made.

8       Pursuant to the terms of the Ancillary Order and the Extension Order, the matrimonial property was transferred to the Wife in November 2018. With police assistance, the Wife obtained possession of the matrimonial property in May 2019.

## The Evidence

### Affidavits filed in respect of the setting-aside application

9       A total of five affidavits were filed by the Parties in respect of the setting-aside application:

> (a)     Husband’s affidavit filed on 28 May 2019 (“**H1**”);

> (b)     Husband’s affidavit filed on 23 July 2019 (“**H2**”);

> (c)     Husband’s nephew’s affidavit filed on 23 July 2019 (“**H3**”);

> (d)     Wife’s affidavit filed on 2 July 2019 (“**W1**”);

> (e)     The Parties’ son’s affidavit filed on 2 July 2019 (“**W2**”); and

## The setting-aside application and the orders made therein

10     The setting-aside application came up for hearing before me on 15 August 2019. After considering the affidavit evidence, written and oral submissions, I made the following orders:

> (a)     The order for lump sum maintenance of $142,800 be set aside;

> (b)     All other orders in the Ancillary Order are to stand; and

> (c)     The Extension Order is to stand.

11     The Husband’s appeal is against my decision:

> (a)     To set aside only part of the Ancillary Order; and

> (b)     Allowing the Extension Order to stand.

### The Husband’s Case in the setting-aside application

12     The Husband submitted that the Ancillary Order should be set aside for the following reasons:

> (a)     The Husband had contributed to the marriage and therefore stood a real prospect of success of receiving a portion of the matrimonial property[^3];

> (b)     Allowing the Ancillary Orders to stand would lead to a miscarriage of justice[^4];

> (c)     There would be no prejudice caused to the Wife that would be irremediable by an order on costs[^5];

> (d)     Granting the setting aside application would not lead to a complete retrial of previously investigated matters[^6];

> (e)     There would be no compromise of the public interest in the finality of litigation[^7];

> (f)     The Husband’s conduct does not amount to contumelious and/or contemptuous behaviour[^8].

13     In support of his case, the Husband argued that the Ancillary Order should not be allowed to stand because:

> (a)     he contributed about 80% towards the flat, yet he did not receive a portion of it in the Ancillary Order;

> (b)     he also made indirect contributions to the family, including paying for monthly utilities and the son’s education[^9]; and

> (c)     the Ancillary Order did not reflect his direct and indirect contributions to the matrimonial assets[^10].

14     According to the Husband, he did not seek legal advice and ignored all RNs directing him to attend court events because he was previously ill-advised by friends who had told him to ignore the proceedings and that the matter would “go away” by itself eventually[^11]. The Husband urged the court to consider the fact that he was illiterate in English beyond reading and writing his own name, and relied on others to interpret the contents of the divorce papers to him[^12]. He submitted that his behaviour was not deliberate and/or contumelious because he acted under ignorance and/or mistake regarding the divorce proceedings, which discouraged him from seeking legal advice and/or representation[^13].

15     In 2018, the Husband sought assistance from the Legal Aid Bureau (“LAB”), and aid was granted to him from about mid-October 2018 to early December 2018[^14]. A solicitor was also assigned to the Husband but, according to him, he did not receive ‘any substantial legal advice’ from this solicitor[^15]. After the LAB cancelled aid, the Husband was once again advised by his friends to ignore the proceedings[^16]. He did not take steps to file the setting-aside application until after he vacated the matrimonial home.

### The Wife’s Case against setting aside the Ancillary Order

16     In defending the setting-side application, the Wife contended that the Ancillary Order should not be set aside for these reasons:

> (a)     The Husband’s reasons for his absence are unsupported and there is evidence to refute the Husband’s version of events[^17];

> (b)     The Husband failed to discharge the burden of proof to show that he had good reason not to attend court proceedings[^18];

> (c)     There is evidence that the Husband deliberately and wilfully disobeyed court proceedings[^19];

> (d)     Substantial prejudice would be caused to the Wife if the Ancillary Order is set aside[^20];

> (e)     There was an inordinate delay in the Husband filing the setting-aside application[^21];

> (f)     A complete retrial is required if the Ancillary Order is set aside[^22];

> (g)     The Husband has not shown that there is a reasonable prospect of success even if the Ancillary Order is set aside[^23];

> (h)     Public interest in finality of litigation would be severely compromised if the Ancillary Order was set aside[^24].

17     In support of her case, the Wife argued that the Husband was well-aware of the proceedings, but chose to ignore them. She contended that this conduct, which caused inordinate delays and prejudice to her, should not be endorsed. She also highlighted that since her departure from the matrimonial home in September 2016, the Husband had been living there to her exclusion. The Wife, on the other hand, was living with her ailing mother in a rental flat during this time. When her mother passed away on 12 May 2019, she was concerned that she would be evicted from the rental flat and left without a place to stay because the rental flat was leased in her mother’s name[^25]. It was then that she took steps to recover possession of the matrimonial home, which led to the involvement of the police officer and the Husband’s eventual departure from the matrimonial home.

### The Law and its applicability

18     The case of _Su Sh-Hsyu v Wee Yue Chew_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] SGCA 31</span> (“_Su v Wee_”) were cited by both parties as being instructive in the summons before me. I found _Su v Wee_ to be helpful in that it set out the relevant factors[^26] for consideration in deciding whether to set aside a judgment obtained in the absence of one party.

19      The Husband’s Delay and Prejudice to the Wife

> (a)     I found there to be an inordinate delay by the Husband in filing the setting-aside application. For clarity, I set out the dates and events significant to the setting aside-application –

>> (i)        **22 March 2017**: Ancillary Order was granted;

>> (ii)        **10 May 2018**: Summons filed by Wife to extend time for transfer of the property. There were two Case Conferences and one hearing related to this summons. The Husband failed to participate at all three court events, despite being aware of them;

>> (iii)        **26 July 2018**: Extension Order granted;

>> (iv)        **27 September 2018**: Transfer documents signed by the Assistant Registrar at the Family Justice Courts, who was satisfied that the Husband had defaulted in signing the relevant transfer documents;

>> (v)        **23 November 2018**: Transfer of property to the Wife’s sole name is completed;

>> (vi)        **7 January 2019**: Notice of Appointment of Solicitors was filed on behalf of the Husband;

>> (vii)        **27 May 2019**: The Wife obtained police assistance to escort the Husband from the matrimonial home. Only when he was threatened with arrest, the Husband vacated the property[^27].

>> (viii)        **28 May 2019**: the Husband filed this summons for setting aside the Ancillary Order and the Extension Order.

> (b)     The lapse of time from the grant of the Ancillary Order until the filing of the setting-aside application was about two years and two months. During this time, the Wife obtained the Extension Order and effected the transfer of the property under the Ancillary Order. The Wife, acting in reliance of the Ancillary Order, also resigned from her job in 2017 to look after her ailing mother until her mother’s death in May 2019[^28]. She did this with the comfort of knowing that she would eventually have a roof over her head. According to the Wife, had she known that the Ancillary Order could be easily set aside, she would have forced herself to continue working in order to ensure her housing needs in her old age[^29].

> (c)     The Wife also submitted that she would have called on her mother to provide useful witness testimony in support of her case for the ancillary matters. This is because her mother lived with the parties for a long period of time during the marriage. However, her mother, having now passed away, was no longer able to do this and this prejudiced the Wife in presenting her case[^30].

> (d)     Based on the evidence and submissions, I was therefore satisfied that, if the Ancillary Order was set aside, the Wife would suffer prejudice that would be irremediable by an order on costs.

20      Whether complete retrial required and reasonable prospects of success

> (a)     These limbs required me to consider whether setting aside of the judgment would entail a complete retrial on matters of fact which have already been investigated by the court, and whether the Husband had a reasonable prospect of success.

> (b)     The Husband did not challenge, and therefore accepted, the allegations made by the Wife in the Statement of Particulars which included the contributions to the family and household made by both parties. In her pleadings, the Wife particularised the Husband’s unreasonable behaviour, contending that the Husband failed to contribute (both financially and non-financially) towards the family[^31]. According to her, the Husband showed no interest in the family and perpetually shirked his responsibilities as a husband and father. The Wife essentially raised their son on her own, working several odd jobs to pay for the household expenses. According to the Wife, the Husband would demand that the Wife lend him money, becoming verbally abusive and aggressive when she refused to do so[^32]. According to the Statement of Particulars, the Husband also has another family with a woman from China. The Wife discovered this when she chanced upon photographs and letters amongst the Defendant’s belongings[^33]. Finally, the Husband failed to show up at their son’s wedding and declared to the outside world that his wife and son were dead[^34].

> (c)     The documents produced by the Husband in support of the setting aside application on the order on division of assets were not helpful – he tendered copies of some AIA insurance policies which, according to him, he no longer owned[^35]. In the circumstances, I was unable to agree with the Husband’s submissions that he was able to provide evidence of his assets[^36]. In my view, setting aside the Ancillary Order would entail a retrial on matters of fact which have already been investigated because the Husband did not provide, in support of the setting aside application, any fresh evidence for the court to consider. In essence, the court had the same evidence that was before it during the ancillary matters hearing in March 2017.

> (d)     In _USZ v UTA_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGFC 23</span> (“_USZ_”), which was cited by both parties, one of the reasons that the Defendant was successful in setting aside the ancillary matters order was that he exhibited, in his affidavit in support of his application, information on his assets, means and indirect contributions towards the family[^37]. This was not done by the Husband in this case, despite this issue being highlighted by the Wife in her affidavit[^38], and the Husband being given an opportunity to respond to this in H2.

> (e)     I accordingly found that the Husband had not shown evidence of his direct or indirect contributions that would demonstrate that there would be a reasonable prospect of success if the Ancillary Order on the property was set aside.

21      Public interest

> (a)     In considering the public interest in finality of litigation in declining to set aside the Ancillary Order on the division of assets, I was unable to ignore the fact that the Husband was afforded due process and was provided with multiple opportunities to be heard in these proceedings. I therefore disagreed with the Husband’s submission that that he had not had the opportunity to litigate the matter in the first place[^39].

> (b)     On the other hand, the Wife complied with all of the court’s directions and diligently participated in court proceedings. Steps were also taken by her to transfer the property pursuant to the Ancillary Order. I accepted the Wife’s submission that the Husband had only filed this application because he was forced to vacate the property by the police the day before[^40]. In considering the concept of ‘a miscarriage of justice’ for the Husband, justice for the Wife must be considered, too.

22     In defending the setting-side application, the Wife also relied on the case of _Vasugee d/o Subramaniam v Vigian s/o Era Vasenthan_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGFC 24</span> (“_Vasugee_”). I found this case useful in articulating the reasons why a person who deliberately chooses to absent himself from court proceeding should not be given further opportunities to be heard. At Paragraph 21 of the judgment, the court stated:

> If parties are allowed to ignore and deliberately fail to attend hearings, only to complain about the result later, this would lead to chaos in the Courts. Cases that have been concluded would be reopened continuously and the Court process would be held ransom by parties who choose whether, and if so, when, to attend Court hearings[^41].

23     The Wife also argued that, similar to Defendant in _Vasugee_, the Husband deliberately stuck his head in the sand and waited until after the Ancillary Order was made to complain about the outcome.

24     I am of the view that the lapse of time of over two years since the order was made is significant. If the Husband’s application to set aside the property order is granted, it potentially involves unravelling events that have transpired in the last two and a half years – specifically, the transfer of the property to the Wife. The difficulty is that Husband was invited to participate every step of the way, but declined to do so until he was physically forced out of a home which was no longer his, under a court order which was made following proceedings which he deliberately did not participate in.

25     Considering the evidence and submissions in totality in the current case, I was of the view that the Husband had failed to meet the burden required of him in the setting aside application, save for the issue of maintenance.

### Allowing the order on maintenance to be set aside

26     In the current application, the Husband asserts that he earns $1,200 per month and is unable to make the payment under the lump sum maintenance order. He submitted that he did not have stable income as an odd-job labourer in the construction industry, and it would be impossible for him to make payment of the sums ordered[^42]. Although he only provided proof of his IRAS payment amounts, I acknowledge that the quantum of $142,800 as lump sum maintenance is significant against what now appears to be the Husband’s income.

27     I did not have the benefit of this information at the ancillary matters hearing and, in my view, the Husband has a reasonable prospect of success on the issue of maintenance. I therefore took the view that he should be given an opportunity to be heard on the issue of maintenance.

### The Husband’s Conduct

28     I was unable to accept the reasons of the Husband’s illiteracy or unfamiliarity with court proceedings as valid reasons for his failure to participate in proceedings, particularly when he was cautioned, in plain language in the RNs, that the Court could proceed to make orders in his absence. For example, the RN dated 24 February 2017, which informed the Husband of the date and time of ancillary matters hearing, stated:

> You are required to attend Court for the hearing of the Ancillary Matters and to conduct and prove your case as stated in your affidavits (sworn (affirmed) written statements for use in court) OR to give oral evidence and present documentary evidence of your case to the court at the hearing.

> If you fail to attend Court, the Court may, nonetheless, proceed to hear the case in your absence and make orders on maintenance for your ex-wife and child(ren) if any, division of matrimonial assets including assets held in your sole name. The court can also include an order for you to pay the legal costs of the other party.

29     The Husband has not demonstrated why he was unable to obtain legal advice and instead chose to rely on the advice of friends. I also found that the Husband had been given ample opportunity to participate in proceedings, but chose not to. When the transfer documents required the Husband’s signature, he ignored the Wife’s requests to sign them. This led to the Wife having to invoke the Registrar’s empowerment clause and request the Registrar of the Family Justice Courts to sign the transfer documents on the Husband’s behalf. This was yet another opportunity for the Husband to come forward and participate in the proceedings, but he again chose to ignore the ongoing court events. Finally, when it became apparent that the Wife was enforcing the Ancillary Order by literally taking over vacant possession of the matrimonial home, he obtained legal advice and filed the setting-aside application.

30     Importance must be placed on finality of proceedings and the fact that many events transpired _subsequent_ to the making of the Ancillary Order, including the transfer of the matrimonial property to the Wife. The court had regard to these factors in _USZ_ in deciding to set aside the ancillary matters order – in that case, only 2 months had lapsed and neither party had taken steps to give effect to the ancillary matters order.

## Conclusion

31     Having regard to the evidence and submissions in totality, I found that the Husband’s case did not meet the burden required in such applications. Until he was physically compelled to leave the matrimonial home by a police officer, the Husband was content to continue living in the matrimonial property to the Wife’s exclusion, as he had been doing since September 2016. During this time, he continuously ignored RNs to attend proceedings and disregarded orders for him to vacate the matrimonial home.

32     In this case, the Husband chose not to participate in court events when he was well aware that orders could be made in his absence. I am of the view that this conduct cannot be condoned, let alone rewarded, because litigants should not be allowed to ‘pick and choose’ which court events they wish to participate in, only to complain about outcomes after the fact.

33     For these reasons, I dismissed the application to set aside the entire Ancillary Order and the Extension Order, with costs fixed at $4,000, payable by the Husband to the Wife[^43].
