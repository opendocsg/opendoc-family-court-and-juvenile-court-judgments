custody – care and control – access – welfare of child

23 March 2021

### District Judge Wendy Yu:

## Introduction

1       The Parties were married on 29 September 2009[^1]. The Plaintiff is a businessman[^2] while the Defendant is a homemaker. The Defendant is from China and holds a long term visit pass.[^3] The Parties have 2 children, T, female, born on XX XXX 2009 (“T”) and S, female, born on XX XXX 2015 (“S”).

2       The Defendant had left the matrimonial home on 5 June 2018, taking S along with her. The Defendant and S have been living at a shelter since then. The Child Protective Services were involved with the family until October 2019.[^4] The parties had signed an Immediate Safety Plan in the presence of a Child Protection Officer on 28 June 2018[^5].

## Background & History of Applications

3       On 25 October 2018, the Defendant and the Plaintiff were granted a Personal Protection Order (“PPO”) against each other[^6]. Both parties also filed PPO applications for the children against each other but these applications were withdrawn on 19 September 2019[^7].

4       The Plaintiff filed an OSG application (OSG 60 /2020) on 17 April 2020 for the following orders:

> _“1_.     _The Plaintiff shall have sole custody, care and control of the children of the marriage, namely, T (BC No. TxxxxxxxE) and S (BC No. TxxxxxxxI) (“children”)_

> _2_.     _The Defendant shall have access as follows:_

>> _For T_

>> (_a_)     _4 weeks of therapeutically facilitated sessions at the therapist’s office every Saturday from 10.00am to 12.00pm_

>> (_b_)     _Thereafter, 12 weeks of unsupervised access every Saturday from 10.00am to 12.00pm at a neutral location._

>> (_c_)     _Thereafter, unsupervised access every Saturday from 10.00am to 2.00pm at a neutral location._

>> _For S_

>> (_a_)     _Weekday access from Monday to Thursday from 6.00pm to 8.00pm at the Plaintiff’s residence or at a neutral location. Weekend access from Friday after school to Sunday at 7.00pm. This access arrangement shall be in place for 3 months._

>> (_b_)     _Thereafter, alternate weekend access from Thursday after school to Saturday at 7.00pm_

> _3_.     _The Plaintiff shall retain the children’s essential documents, namely:_

>> (_a_)     _Passport_,

>> (_b_)     _Birth certificate, and_

>> (_c_)     _Health booklet._

> _4_.     _A penal notice shall be endorsed on the order be made herein against the Defendant._

> _5_.     _Costs._

> _6_.     _Such further or other reliefs as this Honourable Court shall deem fit.”_

5       The Plaintiff had included a joint affidavit filed on 17 April 2020 from Dr W (“Dr W”) and Dr F (“Ms F”) exhibiting a Family Assessment Report dated 6 March 2020 (“Family Assessment Report”) to support his application. Dr W is a Senior Consultant Psychiatrist at W Clinic and Ms F is a Senior Forensic Psychologist at W Clinic. As the Family Assessment Report was not a Court ordered report, the Plaintiff subsequently filed an application (SUM 1616/2020) on 23 June 2020 for leave to admit the Family Assessment Report, and leave was granted on 1 July 2020.

6       The Plaintiff had then filed an application for an injunction (SUM 1259/2020) on 18 May 2020 seeking the handover of S to the Plaintiff’s sole care and control. This application was dismissed on 9 June 2020.

7       The Defendant subsequently filed an application (SUM 1715/2020) on 30 June 2020 for the following orders:

> _“1_.     _Parties shall share joint custody of both children of the marriage, T (BC No. TxxxxxxxE) (“T”) and S (BC No. TxxxxxxxI) (“S”)_,

> _2_.     _The Defendant shall have interim sole care and control of S, pending the conclusion of divorce proceedings between and/or further Order._

> _3_.     _The Defendant shall have interim access to T as follows, pending the conclusion of divorce proceedings between and/or further Order:-_

>> _a_.     _4 weeks of therapeutically facilitated sessions at W Clinic every Saturday from 10.00am to 12.00pm at the Plaintiff’s cost;_

>> _b_.     _Thereafter, 8 weeks of unsupervised access every Saturday from 10.00am to 2.00pm at a public location;_

>> _c_.     _Thereafter, unsupervised overnight access from Fridays after school to Saturday 8.00pm._

> _4_.     _The Plaintiff shall have interim access to S as follows, pending the conclusion of divorce proceedings between and/or further Order:-_

>> _a_.     _4 weeks of therapeutically facilitated sessions at W Clinic every Saturday from 10.00am to 12.00pm at the Plaintiff’s cost;_

>> _b_.     _Thereafter, 8 weeks of unsupervised access every Sunday from 10.00am to 2.00pm at a public location;_

>> _c_.     _Thereafter, unsupervised overnight access from Saturdays 8.00pm to Sundays 8.00pm._

> _5_.     _Each party shall bear their own costs of the proceedings._

> _6_.     _Such further and/or other Order as this Honourable Court deems fit.”_

8       Parties reached an interim arrangement on the issue of access and entered into a Consent Order on 6 July 2020 on the following terms:

>      _“Pending the conclusion of FC/D2592/2020, FC/OSG60/2020 or any other further orders_,

>> _1_.     _With effect from 4 July 2020, the Plaintiff shall have the following interim access to S:_

>>> _a_.     _4 weeks of therapeutically facilitated sessions at W Clinic every Saturday from 10.00am to 12.00pm at the Plaintiff’s costs_,

>>> _b_.     _Thereafter, 8 weeks of unsupervised access every Sunday from 10.00am to 2.00pm at a public location; and_

>>> _c_.     _Thereafter, unsupervised overnight access from Saturdays 8.00pm to Sundays 8.00pm._

>> _2_.     _With effect from 4 July 2020, the Defendant shall have the following interim access to T:_

>>> _a_.     _4 weeks of therapeutically facilitated sessions at W Clinic every Saturday from 10.00am to 12.00pm at the Plaintiff’s costs;_

>>> _b_.     _Thereafter, 8 weeks of unsupervised access every Saturday from 10.00am to 2.00pm at a public location; and_

>>> _c_.     _Thereafter, unsupervised overnight access from Friday after school to Saturday 8.00pm.”_

9       Two other interim applications were filed by the Plaintiff after the Consent Order was made. The Plaintiff filed FC/SUM 2468/2020, an injunction application on 27 August 2020 for interim care and control for both children after a COVID-19 scare occurred at the crisis shelter where the Defendant resided at. The Plaintiff also filed FC/SUM 3356/2020, a variation application, on 2 November 2020, for, _inter alia_, orders that the Defendant’s unsupervised access to T shall be in a 4-star hotel or equivalent accommodation and for other orders related to the costs of the accommodation and in-room service. Both applications were dismissed.

10     The Defendant filed for divorce (D2592/2020) on 30 June 2020. At the time of the hearing of this application, parties have already agreed to proceed with the divorce on an uncontested basis and a Registry Notice on 30 December 2020 was sent to parties to inform them that the matter has been fixed for uncontested divorce hearing on 15 January 2021.

## Hearing of OSG 60/2020 and SUM 1715/2020

### Plaintiff’s Submissions

11     The Plaintiff had cited various cases including the Court of Appeal decision in _CX v CY <span class="citation">\[2005\] 3 SLR(R) 690</span>_**[^8]** (“_CX v CY_”) and submitted[^9] that a sole custody order is appropriate in the following situations:

> (a)     That there has been physical, sexual or emotional abuse inflicted on the children;

> (b)     That there is no hope of cooperation between the parties such that the lack of cooperation is harmful to the children; and

> (c)     That the decision-making ability of the other party is questionable or flawed.

12     The Plaintiff has also submitted that there should not be a split care and control order and cited[^10] various Family Court decisions to support his argument. The Plaintiff also highlighted the case of _ABW v ABV (2014) SGHC 29_ (“_ABW v ABV_”) where Justice Judith Prakash (as she then was) opined:

> _“\[23_\]     _The decision as to what is in the best interests of any particular child depends on the circumstances of the individual case and the individual child. However, this does not mean that the decision is a subjective one for the judge hearing the case. Rather, a number of relevant circumstances should be taken into account when arriving at a decision. The stability factor is but one such circumstance._

>      _Others include:_

>> (_a_)     _The need for both parents to have an involvement in the child’s life;_

>> (_b_)     _Which parent shows the greater concern for the child;_

>> (_c_)     _The maternal bond;_

>> (_d_)     _The child’s wishes; and_

>> (_e_)     _The desirability of keeping siblings together._

> \[_24_\]   _The degree to which any one factor or the other is to be given pre-eminence is not fixed but depends entirely on the facts of each case.”_

13     The Plaintiff’s counsel had highlighted[^11] the case of _ARI v ARJ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGDC 135</span>_ (_“ARI v ARJ”)_ where the Family Court reversed a joint custody order to one of sole custody to support their argument that the Court should do the same in this case. The parties in _ARI v ARJ_ had dissolved their marriage in Serbia and both had applied for sole custody of the child. In awarding sole custody to the wife, the Court observed that the Husband had repeatedly raised unsubstantiated allegations of the wife abusing the child, resulting in a medical social worker, the police and the then Ministry of Community, Youth and Sports (“MCYS”) getting involved. The atmosphere of repeated upheaval for the child was created by the Husband and despite the Wife’s genuine intentions to cooperate with the husband, he was unable to make decisions in the child’s best interest.

### Defendant’s Submissions

14     The Defendant’s counsel cited[^12] the case of _CX v CY_ to reinforce the point that sole custody orders are only granted on an exceptional basis, and that “acrimony alone was not sufficient to justify a sole custody order”. The Defendant’s counsel also highlighted the case of _APE v APF <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 17</span>_ (“_APE v APF_”) where the High Court emphasised that the threshold for granting a sole custody order was a high one to support their position that there is no justification to deviate from a joint custody order.

15     The Defendant also cited the case of _ABW v ABV_ to set out the relevant factors that the Court should consider in determining what constitutes the “welfare” of the child but emphasised that the stability factor is but one such factor, and that the other factors that the Court should consider is the need for both parents to have an involvement in the child’s life, as well as the maternal bond.

16     The Defendant’s main submission is that it is not in the welfare of the children for any change in the care and control of either child to be implemented as both children had only resumed interaction with each other and with the other parent in July 2020.[^13] Parties have been exercising unsupervised overnight access to the children since 20 November 2020 and the children are only beginning to be accustomed to the current arrangements over the last 6 weeks[^14]. The Defendant has contended that it would be disruptive for the children to have to adapt to a change in this arrangement again.

### Orders Made

17     After hearing the parties on 4 January 2021 for both applications, I made the following orders:

>      _“That pending the determination of the ancillary matters in Divorce Suit No. 2592/2020:_

>> (_a_)     _Parties shall have joint custody of the children of the marriage, namely, T (BC No. TxxxxxxxE) (“T”) and S (BC No. TxxxxxxxI) (“S”), with care and control of T to the Plaintiff and care and control of S to the Defendant._

>> (_b_)     _The Plaintiff shall have unsupervised overnight access to S from Saturdays 8.00pm to Sundays 8.00pm._

>> (_c_)     _The Defendant shall have unsupervised access to T from Fridays after school to Saturdays 8.00pm._

> _2_.     _Costs of $1,500 inclusive of disbursements to be paid by the Plaintiff to the Defendant for FC/OSG 60/2020 and FC/SUM 1715/2020._

> _3_.     _Parties shall attend Children-in- Between counselling and a Custody Evaluation Report shall be prepared by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (“MSF”). The Plaintiff is at liberty to produce the reports by Dr W to the MSF.”_

18     The above orders were essentially preserving the status quo to give time to the children to build their relationship with both parents. I have also ordered that penal notices, that apply to both parties, to be inserted in the order.

19     The Plaintiff has filed a Notice of Appeal on 18 January 2021 against the following part of my decision as follows:

>      _“That pending the determination of the ancillary matters in Divorce Suit No. 2592/2020:_

>> (_d_)     _Parties shall have joint custody of the children of the marriage, namely, T (BC No. TxxxxxxxE) (“T”) and S (BC No. TxxxxxxxI) (“S”), with care and control of T to the Plaintiff and care and control of S to the Defendant._

>> (_e_)     _The Plaintiff shall have unsupervised overnight access to S from Saturdays 8.00pm to Sundays 8.00pm._

> _2_.     _Costs of $1,500 inclusive of disbursements to be paid by the Plaintiff to the Defendant for FC/OSG 60/2020 and FC/SUM 1715/2020.”_

20     I will now give my reasons for my decision.

### The Law

21     The parties have applied under Section 5 of the Guardianship of Infants Act (Cap 122, 1985 Rev Ed) (“GIA”) for the Court to make an order for custody care and control and access pending their divorce. In deciding custody and upbringing issues the Court must regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration, pursuant to Section 3 of the GIA.

### Custody

22     The Court of Appeal has stated determinatively in _CX v CY_ that in any custody proceedings, “the idea of joint parental responsibility is deeply rooted in our family law jurisprudence” and that

>> “_(t)here can be no doubt that the welfare of a child is best secured by letting him enjoy the love, care and support of both parents. The needs of a child do not change simply because his parents no longer live together. Thus, in any custody proceedings, it is crucial that the courts recognise and promote joint parenting so that both parents can continue to have a direct involvement in the child’s life_” (at \[26\]).

23     The Court of Appeal in _CX v CY_ had opined that a joint custody order should be made in that case because of the symbolism of such an order “may be used to remind the mother that the father has an equal say in more significant matters concerning the child’s upbringing.” (at \[20\]).

24     While the Plaintiff had submitted that a sole custody order is appropriate because there has been physical violence inflicted on the children, these allegations of physical violence towards the children were made by both parties against each other. More importantly, while parties have filed PPO applications for the children against each other, these applications were withdrawn by parties on 19 September 2019[^15]. If the Plaintiff was concerned that that the Defendant was indeed so violent towards the children to the extent that it necessitated a sole custody order then the PPO application should not have been withdrawn. I also note that despite the Plaintiff’s allegations of physical violence towards the children against the Defendant, the Plaintiff had agreed to the Consent Order in July 2020, having had reached the agreement with the benefit of independent legal advice, of which agreement included giving unsupervised overnight access of T to the Defendant.

25     The Plaintiff had highlighted the case of _ARI v ARJ_ in his submissions as well at the hearing to further his case that he should have sole custody of the children as he “can make good decisions on behalf of the child” and he doubts “whether the wife can do so”[^16]. The case of _ARI v ARJ_ can clearly be distinguished from our case.

26     In _ARI v ARJ_ the Court found that the decisions made by the Father showed that he did not consider the impact of his actions on the welfare of the child, and an example provided was when the Father had refused to agree to the referral by MCYS for the child to be seen by the Ministry’s recommended counsellor, psychologist or therapist.[^17] As a result of the Father’s insistence that an independent psychiatrist treat the child in that case, the child was unable to gain access to counselling or any other form of therapy that would have benefitted the child, which persuaded the Court to consider that having the Father’s consent as a joint custodial parent for medical matters would be detrimental to the child in view of his lack of insight and refusal to act in the interest of the child. There is no evidence before me that the Defendant had conducted herself in a similar manner.

27     On the point of animosity and lack of co-operation between the parties, the Court in _ARI v ARJ_ took this factor into consideration as the Court noted[^18] the Father was constantly litigious, repeatedly filing various civil and family applications against the Mother and had little or no regard for the Mother’s opinion and showed that he wanted to be the sole decision maker on issues pertaining to the child’s welfare. In our case, it was clear that it was the Plaintiff who was filing multiple applications which were dismissed and not the Defendant. It appeared from the submissions by the Plaintiff that he wanted to be the sole decision maker on issues pertaining to the child’s welfare as he has doubts that that the Defendant could do so. I am of the view that there is no evidence of any “exceptional” circumstances before me to warrant a departure from the Court’s role in promoting joint parenting in the children’s life.

### Care and control and Access

28     The Plaintiff had submitted that he should have the care and control of both children as split care and control is not in the children’s interest. While it is ideal for both children to live together to give each other support, I note that this arrangement has been in place since 2018 (notwithstanding the Plaintiff’s position that the Defendant has been the one who has created this situation) and the issue of custody, care and control in the longer term will be decided shortly by the Court at the ancillary hearing.

29     As I am guided by the High Court in _ABW v ABV_, the decision as to what is in the best interest of any particular child depends on the circumstances of the individual case and individual child. I took into consideration the number of relevant factors which included the stability factor, the need for both parties to have an involvement in the child’s life, the maternal bond and the desirability of keeping siblings together. The degree to which any one factor or the other is to be given pre-eminence is not fixed but depends entirely on the facts of each case.

30     While the desirability of keeping siblings together is important, it should not be given pre-eminence in this case. I accorded weight to the other factors such as the stability factor, the maternal bond and for both parties to have an involvement in the child’s life. I have given more weight to the stability factor and the maternal bond because there is sufficient evidence before me that Stephanie has had a history of separation anxiety and a sudden and abrupt removal of her from her mother would be detrimental to her well-being.

31     The Defendant had adduced a letter from S’s school[^19] stating their observation that S suffered from anxiety from her mother. The Defendant had also exhibited a Social Report from the Anglican Family Centre dated 23 June 2020[^20] which included a statement at paragraph 3.3 that S was “observed to have increased in her separation anxiety when she returned after the incident when (the Plaintiff) had snatched S away during supervised access on 2 March 2019. S was also noted to be less active and spoke less to the adults in the shelter, and was clingier to (the Defendant).”

32     Dr W and Ms F had also acknowledged S’s separation anxiety in their report and had stated[^21] that “it would be traumatic for S to be abruptly removed from her current care arrangement as she perceives (the Defendant) to be her primary attachment figure. This is especially so when S appeared to have already developed a fear of being forcefully removed from (the Defendant) based on past experiences. A step-up parenting plan in which S gets to maintain daily contact with (the Defendant) while working towards an equitable time-sharing arrangement would prepare S for the transition in a more gradual manner.”

33     It is not disputed that the Plaintiff only re-established regular access with S in July 2020, through the Consent Order, after an extended period of absence. It is also not disputed that the overnight access only commenced on 20 November 2020[^22], which is only about 6 weeks from the date of the hearing. It will be too disruptive for the school going children to make a sudden change to the current arrangements, especially for the 6 year old S, as a change in care and control may result in having to uproot her from her familiar surroundings, including her current school and her classmates.

34     I was of the view that an objective assessment of the children’s well-being through a Custody Evaluation Report was necessary before I decide whether to make any changes to the status quo.

35     I had accepted the Defendant’s argument that it is in the best interest of the children, at least for now, to preserve status quo and stability in the children’s lives pending the conclusion of the divorce proceedings while slowly rebuilding the parties’ relationship with both children.

36     I decided that T should remain under the care and control of the Plaintiff, with the status quo to remain to give her time to re-build her relationship gradually with the Defendant.

### Penal Notice and Costs

37     I agreed with the request of both parties for a Penal Notice to be inserted in the order to ensure strict compliance with the orders.

38     As costs usually follow the event, I made an order for the Plaintiff to pay costs of $1500 to the Defendant for both applications.
