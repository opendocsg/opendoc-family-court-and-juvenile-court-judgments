Family Law – Divorce – Unreasonable Behaviour

4 March 2021

### District Judge Cassandra Cheong:

1       This is the Plaintiff’s appeal against my decision to dismiss his Writ for Divorce filed on 10 August 2019. I shall refer to the Plaintiff as “the Husband” and the Defendant as “the Wife”.

## Background Facts:

2       Parties were married on 10 July 1999 in Malaysia and subsequently settled down in Singapore sometime in 2011. They have two children to the marriage, namely, a son aged 18 years old and a daughter aged 20 years old as at the time of the hearing. [^1]

3       On 10 August 2019, the Husband commenced divorce proceedings based on the fact that the marriage had broken down irretrievably in that the Wife had behaved in such a way that he could not reasonably be expected to live with her. The Wife filed a Defence on 10 September 2019 contesting the divorce as she was not agreeable to the dissolution of the marriage.

## The parties’ cases

### The Husband’s Case

4       The Husband had particularised the Wife’s alleged unreasonable behaviour as follows[^2]:

> (a)     The Wife does not show respect to the Husband and would criticise the Husband in front of the children. Since the Husband and the Wife moved to Singapore 6 years ago from Johor Bahru, the Wife has forbidden the children to visit their grandmother (the Husband’s mother) who is residing in Ipoh, Malaysia. On one occasion when the Husband returned to Malaysia to visit his mother, the Wife would humiliate him in the presence of his children, saying that he was going back to his mother “to suckle”.[^3]

> (b)     The Wife had on a few occasions embarrassed the Husband whenever he communicated with his female friends. On 19 March 2019, when the Husband’s female friend sent him birthday wishes, the Wife suspected the Husband of having an affair with the said friend. The Wife then contacted the said friend’s husband to inform him about the said friend’s actions, much to the embarrassment of the Husband. Both the said friend and her husband have known the Husband for many years, to the full knowledge of the Wife.[^4]

> (c)     There were many instances where the Wife made decisions on family trips and matters without first consulting the Husband. For instance, in December 2018, the Wife booked a trip to Europe without prior discussion with the Husband until she was at the tour agency when she contacted the Husband to check on his available dates. During one Chinese New Year occasion, the Defendant organised a buffet and invited her siblings to the house without first informing the Plaintiff.[^5]

> (d)     On 24 March 2019, when the Husband was about to leave the house for work, the Wife told him abruptly that she was going to sell the family car and buy a small car for their daughter as she was applying for a driving licence. That night, she texted the Husband via WhatsApp to inform him that she was buying the car for $99,000 and selling the family car. The Husband was infuriated by the Wife’s lack of respect for his wishes. During a conversation on or about that day, the Wife also told the Husband that she had transferred monies from their joint bank accounts to her own account without first seeking his approval.[^6]

> (e)     On the night of 24 March 2019, upon the Husband informing the Wife that he wanted to seek a divorce, the Wife was infuriated and told the Husband that if the Husband wanted to sell the matrimonial flat and split the sale proceeds, then the Husband should move out of the flat. She also expressed an intention to have the matrimonial flat to herself. The Wife then retained the Husband’s wallet, passport, keys to his van, joint-ATM card and Ipoh house keys and has demanded a sum of S$30,000 in exchange for the return of those items to the Husband. The Husband slept in the living room that night and left the matrimonial flat the next morning without returning.[^7]

### The Wife’s Case

5       The Wife filed only a Defence and no Counterclaim. She generally denied that the Plaintiff’s allegations were true or claimed that even if they were true, did not amount to unreasonable behaviour on the part of the Wife.[^8]

6       In defence to paragraph 1(a) of the Husband’s Statement of Particulars, the Wife denied the Husband’s allegations and stated that she has always respected the Husband and has always discussed family matters, including the children’s matters, with the Husband. The Wife denied criticising the Husband in the presence of the children or forbidding them to visit the Husband’s mother in Ipoh. The Wife further claimed that the Husband himself had been too preoccupied with his own business and personal matters to organise trips to Ipoh for the family to visit his mother and that she has always made known to the Husband that she is amenable to visiting the Husband’s mother in Ipoh together with him and the children.[^9]

7       The Wife also denied having behaved in the manner as alleged by the Husband in paragraph 1(b) of the Statement of Particulars and averred that she has never interfered with the Husband’s communications with his female friends as the Husband has kept his personal interactions with his female friends private.[^10]

8       Contrary to the Husband’s allegations in paragraph 1(c) of the Statement of Particulars, the Wife averred that she had always apprised the Husband of the annual family trips way in advance before the date of the family trips, which the Husband usually left to her to organise. The Husband would acquiesce to the proposed family trip either explicitly or by not voicing out any objections to it. With regards to the alleged incident in December 2018, the Wife had already informed the Husband way in advance before going to the tour agency to make the booking for the Europe Trip. As for the alleged incident regarding Chinese New Year, although no date was given by the Husband, the Wife averred that it is usual for the Husband’s next-of-kin, relatives and friends and similarly, her siblings to come to their house and celebrate Chinese New Year and eat together. The Husband has always been aware of this custom and organising a buffet was a more economical and efficacious means of enabling their next-of-kin, relatives and friends to eat together.[^11]

9       With regards to paragraph 1(d) of the Statement of Particulars, the Wife again denied behaving in the manner as alleged by the Husband. Based on the messages exchanged between parties, the Husband appeared to be amenable to the idea of buying a new Honda Car. The Wife did not ask the Husband to sell the family car but mooted the idea instead of changing to a suitable smaller and cheaper car in order to reduce his financial burden of paying for the car instalments. Such a car would also be safer and easier for the children to control and drive after getting their respective driving licenses, being new and inexperienced drivers. With regards to the transfer of monies from their joint account, the Wife clarified that the monies were transferred to the children’s bank accounts so as to put aside funds to pay for their educational expenses. Moreover, the interest earned on monies in the children’s bank accounts was higher. She had already informed the Husband of this prior to the said transfer and the Husband did not voice any objections to the proposed plan. [^12]

10     With regards to paragraph 1(e) of the Statement of Particulars, save for the allegation that the Husband had informed her that he wanted the divorce, the Wife denied the allegations made therein. The Wife clarified that when the Husband informed her of his intention to end the marriage, the Husband had also informed her that he wanted to give care and control of the children to her pursuant to the divorce and to sell the matrimonial home. The Husband also wanted the Wife to jointly maintain the children even though she told him that she had a significantly, smaller earning capacity of about $2000 compared to his earning capacity of about between $15,000 and $20,000 per month from his business, which she has helped to build and develop over many years. The Wife told the Husband that since she had been working for many years in the business helping the Husband, she is less marketable and hence, it would be harder for her to find a job elsewhere. Unless the Husband provides adequate maintenance for her and the children, she is unable to financially support the children and herself. It was in this context that the Wife asked the Husband to let her retain the matrimonial flat so that she and the children would have a roof over their heads. Since the Husband was going to leave the matrimonial home and abandon her and the children, the Wife further asked the Husband to leave a sum of $10,000 for her and the children to tide over whilst he was away as it was uncertain whether the Husband would return home to provide for her and the children. The Husband, thereafter, voluntarily issued a cheque for the sum of $30,000 in the name of the Wife and left it on the table in the home for her to bank in. However, he subsequently cancelled the cheque before the Wife could deposit it into her bank account. The Wife also averred the following [^13]:

> (a)     The Wife denies taking the Husband’s wallet or keeping the Husband’s keys to the house and the van

> (b)     Each party has their own set of keys to the house and the van and the Wife has kept her own set while the Husband kept his;

> (c)     The joint-atm card has always been kept and used by the Wife with the Husband’s knowledge and acquiescence;

> (d)     The Husband’s passport has always been kept by the Wife together with her passport and the children’s passports and he could retrieve his passport if he wanted.

> (e)     She further told the Husband that she has a share in his business because she had contributed to at least 50% to the start-up capital for the business and the Husband should have registered the business as a partnership between them. He has no rights to kick her out of the business and it is time for the Husband to give her her rightful share of the business profits.

## The Issues

11     The issues of this case to be decided by the Court are as follows:

> (a)     Whether the Wife had behaved as alleged by the Husband; and

> (b)     If she did, is that behaviour such that the Husband cannot reasonably be expected to live with her?

## The Law

12     It is trite law that under Section 95(1) of the Women’s Charter the sole ground for divorce is that the marriage has irretrievably broken down.

13     Section 95(3) of the Women’s Charter goes on to state that:

>     “The court hearing any proceedings for divorce shall not hold a marriage to have broken down irretrievably unless the plaintiff satisfies the Court of one of the following facts: …

>> (b)    that the defendant has behaved in such a way that the plaintiff cannot reasonably be expected to live with the defendant”

14     The test in determining whether the defendant has behaved in such a way that the plaintiff cannot reasonably be expected to live with the defendant was laid down in the seminal case of _Wong Siew Boey v Lee Boon Fatt_ <span class="citation">\[1994\] SGHC 35</span> and upheld in the case of _Teo Hoon Ping v Tan Lay Ying Angeline_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGHC 244</span>.

15     In _Wong Siew Boey v Lee Boon Fatt_ <span class="citation">\[1994\] SGHC 35</span> the late KS Rajah JC (as he then was) had opined at \[8\]:

>     “Whether the respondent’s behaviour has been such that the petitioner can no longer reasonably be expected to live with the respondent is essentially a finding of fact and the courts have avoided categorising conduct as guilty or blameless in the extract. The question whether the petitioner finds it intolerable to live with the respondent must be answered subjectively: whether his attitude is reasonable is irrelevant. In dealing with the behaviour, the question is whether the petitioner can reasonably be expected to live with the respondent and it is for the court, and not the petitioner, to answer this. The test becomes objective… The court must have regard to the personalities of the individuals before it, however far these may be removed from the theoretical norm, and it must assess the impact of the respondent’s conduct and the particular petitioner in the light of the whole history of the marriage and their relationship.”

16     The general test, the Court had stated at \[9\], was as follows:

>     “Would any right-thinking person come to the conclusion that this husband has behaved in such a way that this wife cannot reasonably be expected to live with him, taking into account the whole of the circumstances and the characters and personalities of the parties?”

17     The Court further emphasised at \[13\] that the cumulative effect of the behaviour must also be taken into account. Any conduct, active or passive, constitutes behaviour and includes behaviour towards other members of the family or towards outsiders, as long as the behaviour may have regard to the marriage. Any and all behaviour may be taken into account, including omissions, where it has reference to the marriage.

18     In the case of _Teo Hoon Ping v Tan Lay Ying Angeline_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGHC 244</span>, the Court reaffirmed the test and further clarified it as follows:

>     “The test requires the court to ask if the plaintiff, with his or her characteristics and personality, with his or her faults and other attributes, good or bad, and having regard to his or her behaviour during the marriage, can reasonably be expected to live with the defendant.

>     The test as stated is an objective one that requires the court to take into account the subjective qualities of the plaintiff. There appears to be no local case that has directly addressed the issue of whether the reasons for the defendant having acted as he did should be a factor in determining the reasonableness of his behaviour.

>     Both a literal reading of S 95(3)(b) of the Women’s Charter as well as the test in _Wong Siew Boey_ suggest that the focus of the analysis should be on whether the defendant’s behaviour was so unreasonable that the union has become impossible, rather than on any consideration of blameworthiness. Although it is common to describe S 95(3)(b) as allowing for the dissolution of marriage due to unreasonable behaviour, this is a misnomer. Section 95(3)(b) deals only with behaviour that is sufficiently grave for the court to conclude that one party cannot reasonably be expected to live with the other. Hence, the reasons for the defendant’s behaviour are secondary to the question of whether it is reasonable to expect a plaintiff to continue living with him or her.”

19     The onus is on the Husband to prove that the Wife had, on a balance of probabilities, acted in a way that he cannot reasonably be expected to live with her.

## The Court’s Findings

### Whether the Wife had behaved in the manner as alleged by the Husband?

#### Paragraph 1(a) of the SOP: Did the Wife disrespect the husband and criticise him in front of the children, forbade the children to visit the paternal grandmother and humiliate the Plaintiff in front of the children by saying he was going back to the paternal grandmother to suckle?

20     With regards to Husband’s allegations of the Wife disallowing their children to visit the Husband’s mother in Ipoh, apart from a bare statement made in his pleadings and affidavit, I find that there is insufficient evidence provided by the Husband of this for the following reasons:

> (a)     During cross-examination, the Husband had testified that when the children were young, he had asked the Wife if he could bring the children with him and she had told him no.[^14] I note that this was not mentioned either in the Husband’s Statement of Particulars or in his affidavit and only surfaced in the course of cross-examination. No particulars were provided by the Husband as to when this alleged incident had occurred.

> (b)     Upon further questioning the Husband conceded that he was unsure whether the Wife had told the children not to follow him to his mother’s place and claimed that since they have not followed him, there must be some reason why they didn’t want to follow him there.[^15]

> (c)     He further conceded that, now that the children were older, it was more out of habit that they did not follow him to visit his mother.[^16] His daughter and son are 20 and 18 years of age respectively and are considered to be matured and independent.[^17]

> (d)     The Husband admitted in his affidavit that he was not close to either of the children and that neither of the children have reached out to contact him or responded to his to meet for dinner.[^18]

21     The Wife denied forbidding the children to visit the Husband’s mother. Now that the children were older, she left it to them to decide whether to follow the Husband to his mother’s home.[^19] She further gave evidence that after parties moved to Singapore in 2011, they rarely visited their families in Ipoh. Parties would travel back on average, only once every two to three years.[^20] The Husband would make the arrangements for them to visit their families in Ipoh. He would drive them there and leave the Wife and their children at her mother’s place before driving to his mother’s place where he would stay for the rest of the duration in Ipoh.[^21] As it was difficult for the Wife to get transport from her mother’s place to the Husband’s place, she did not bring the children to visit the Husband’s mother.[^22] Neither did the Husband make any plans to fetch the children or the Wife to visit his mother at her place. He would make plans instead with his mother and siblings and would only visit the Wife and the children when they arranged to meet him for meals.[^23]

22     The Wife further gave evidence in support of her relationship with the Husband’s parents which was not disputed by the Husband:

> (a)     When the Husband was working in China six years ago, the Wife had brought the children to visit the Husband’s mother with the assistance of her uncle, who drove them there.[^24]

> (b)     When the Husband’s mother visited the Singapore in 2018, the Wife had arranged for the entire family to have a big seafood dinner with the Husband’s mother.[^25]

> (c)     When the Husband’s father fell ill in 2017, as the Husband was busy with work, the Wife flew to Ipoh for a day to check on the Husband’s father’s well-being. [^26]

23     The burden is on the Husband to prove that the Wife had to disallowed the children from visiting his parents. From the evidence provided however, I find that the Husband has not proven on the balance of probabilities that the Wife had forbidden the children to visit the Husband’s mother. Rather, it was now out of habit that the children did not follow the Husband to visit their paternal grandmother, given that they did not share a close relationship with the Husband. If the Wife had exerted any influence over the children, the Husband had conceded that this was when the children were younger.

24     I wish to add that, although no particulars were stated by the Husband in his evidence as to when he had asked the Wife if he could bring the children to visit his mother, it is noted from the context of the evidence given that any allegations of the Wife forbidding the children to visit the Husband’s mother would have taken place while the children were much younger. Parties would have cohabited for more than a period of six months since the last incident of the alleged behavior.

25     With regards as to whether the Wife had humiliated the Husband in front of the children by saying he was going back to the paternal grandmother to suckle, again I note no particulars were furnished by the Husband in his Statement of Particulars as to when the Wife had said or done this in front of the children.[^27] No evidence was also given in his affidavit in relation to this allegation.[^28]

26     The Wife admitted that when the Plaintiff had casually informed her about an upcoming trip to Ipoh, she had verbally teased him in mandarin “Return home to drink milk?”, the innuendo being to “suckle”, to which the Husband had playfully replied “Yes, so what if I do? I enjoy it?” According to the Wife, this was an isolated incident when she had made that remark.[^29] The Wife further testified that in the course of their 20 years of marriage, parties would sometimes employ sarcasm and dry wit in their conversations. This was one such occasion and the children were aware of the nature of parties’ relationship.[^30] As this was a one-off incident, I was not persuaded that the Wife had behaved in a way that the Husband cannot reasonably be expected to live with her.

27     Counsel for the Husband also relied on the text messages exhibited in the Wife’s own affidavit, where she names the Husband as “Big Pig’s Trotters Husband”, as an example of the Wife’s disrespectful behaviour towards the Husband.[^31] I note this was not raised in any of the Husband’s pleadings or his affidavit. No evidence was also given as to when the Wife had started naming the Husband with this term in her handphone, such as whether it was before or after the Husband had indicated his intention to end the marriage. As such, I did not place much weight on this particular piece of evidence in determining whether the Wife had been disrespectful towards the Husband in the course of the marriage.

#### Paragraph 1(b) of the SOP: Did the Wife suspect the Husband of having an affair, embarrassing him by communicating with his female friends and calling the husband of his female friend?

28     With regards to the allegation that the Wife had embarrassed him by communicating with his female friends and calling the husband of a female friend whom she had suspected him of having an affair with, apart from a bare statement, the Husband has not provided any evidence of this. As for the allegation that the Wife had suspected him of having an affair, the only evidence that the Husband has adduced is an exchange of text messages with the Wife dated 27 March 2019 (after the Husband had informed the Wife of his intention to divorce her) during which the Wife claims that she is not his girlfriend.[^32] It is unclear from the context of the text messages between parties if the Wife was simply being caustic or if she truly suspected him of having an affair. No other evidence was provided by the Husband as to how the Wife had been suspicious of him having an affair during the course of their marriage.

29     On cross-examination, the Husband admitted that the Wife had never accused him of having marital affairs,[^33] which was consistent with the Wife’s testimony.[^34] He further conceded that no evidence had been provided in support of his allegations, namely, that the Wife had embarrassed him whenever he communicated with his female friends or that she had contacted his female friend’s husband.[^35] As such, I find that the Husband has failed to provide any evidence to prove on a balance of probabilities the above allegations made against the Wife.

#### Paragraph 1(c) of the SOP: Did the Wife make decisions on family trips and matters without first consulting the Husband?

#### (1)   Family Trips

30     Although the Husband’s Statement of Particulars referred to an incident in December 2018, no evidence was given or led specifically in relation to that incident. Parties gave instead on broad terms as to the _modus operandi_ for the arrangement of family trips:

> (a)     The Husband’s evidence is that prior to December 2015, the Wife would discuss all family trips with him prior to making the relevant tour bookings. However, since December 2015, the Wife would only contact him when she was at the travel agency itself to ask for his available dates. This made the Husband feel disrespected by the Wife.[^36]

> (b)     The Wife’s evidence is that parties started going on annual family trips from December 2015 onwards. She denied the Husband’s allegations as the planning for such year-end trips would start as early as January or February. The Wife would usually moot an idea and the Plaintiff would either consent explicitly or acquiesce by not voicing any objections. He would leave it to the Wife to plan and arrange the trips. The Husband would be busy with work, so the Wife would attend travel fairs to search for deals and packages. Hence, it came as a shock to the Wife when the Husband raised this as an issue in his Statement of Particulars.[^37]

> (c)     It is undisputed by parties that since December 2015, the Wife would be the one who makes the relevant bookings for the family holidays. She would contact the Husband at the travel agency and ask for his available dates prior to the booking and the Husband would pay for all the family trips.[^38]

31     I find it difficult to conclude from the evidence provided that the Wife had booked their family trips without consulting the Husband. If this was the case, there would have been no necessity for her to check with the Husband on his available dates. The fact remains however that she had contacted the Husband to enquire on his availability for the said trips. It was open to the Husband at any point in time to inform the Wife that he did not wish to go for the said trip or that he disagreed with the proposed travel plans. I note further from that the Husband would accede to the Wife’s plans and not once did he inform her of her allegedly disrespectful behaviour.[^39]

#### (2)   Chinese New Year

32     The Husband had alleged in his Statement of Particulars that on one Chinese New Year, the Wife had organised a buffet and invited her siblings without informing him. Although no particular date was stated in his Statement of Particulars, it was subsequently added in his affidavit, where the Husband made reference to the Chinese New Year celebration in 2019.[^40]

33     The Husband’s evidence is that it was not customary for the Wife’s siblings to come over to their place for dinner during Chinese New Year. This custom only began in 2019. He felt disrespected by the Wife as he was only informed one day before, on Chinese New Year Eve, that the Wife had invited her siblings over to their place for dinner.[^41]

34     The Wife’s evidence is that her siblings had been visiting on Chinese New Year every year. Each year, when they visit, she would inform the Husband of this and not once has he voiced any objections. With regards to the organizing of dinners and celebrations, they would discuss it as a family and the Husband would give his opinion on the caterers and dishes he preferred.[^42]

35     On cross-examination, the Wife testified that she had informed the Husband very early of the buffet and of her siblings attending.[^43] She had even consulted him on the dishes[^44] and on the number of persons attending before ordering the buffet. She further testified that she did not invite the Husband’s younger brother, who was also residing in Singapore, as she had been busy with both the Chinese New Year celebration and their son’s birthday celebration which coincided.[^45] She invited her siblings, while her son invited his friends. She had asked the Husband to contact his younger brother but he did not.[^46]

36     The Wife’s evidence of the son’s birthday coinciding with the Chinese New Year celebration and of her having asked the Husband to contact his younger brother were not disputed on evidence or in the Husband’s counsel’s submissions. I note further from the Husband’s testimony during cross-examination that he could not recall whether the Wife had consulted him on the dishes to order for the buffet dinner. When pressed further by counsel, the Husband stated “I don’t think so. It’s the New Year Eve that I came to know about it” and “I think she informed me one day beforehand”.[^47] He appeared hesitant and uncertain in his answer.

37     Apart from their oral testimonies, no further evidence was provided by the Husband and the Wife in relation to the Chinese New Year incident. Given that the burden is on the Husband first to prove his allegations, I find that the husband has failed to prove on a balance of probabilities that the Wife had indeed failed to inform him of dinner with her siblings. In fact, it was not just a dinner with the Wife’s siblings in celebration of the Chinese New Year, but also a celebration of their son’s birthday where the son’s friends were also invited. Given the scale and nature of the celebration, I find it more probable that the Husband would have been aware of the buffet organised and of the Wife’s siblings attending.

38     Counsel for the Husband had submitted that by failing to invite the Husband’s brother for Chinese New Year celebrations and forbidding the children to visit the Husband’s mother, the Wife not only disrespected the Husband by her behaviour, but also alienated the Husband’s family from her own family.[^48] I find that difficult to conclude based on the present facts. There is insufficient evidence provided for me to conclude that the Wife had alienated the Husband from his family. In any event, I note that this was not specifically pleaded in the Husband’s Statement of Particulars.

#### Paragraph 1(d) of the SOP: Did the Wife disrespect the Husband’s wishes in relation to the family car and was the Husband infuriated? Did the Wife transfer monies out of their joint bank account without his approval?

#### (1)   The Family Car

39     From the evidence provided, I find that the Husband was in fact agreeable to the proposed plan in relation to the family car for the following reasons:

> (a)     When the Wife had informed him that he would need to sign the papers in relation to the sale of the family car, the Husband had responded “any time”.[^49]

> (b)     On cross-examination, the Husband testified that he had objected initially to the purchase of the new car. However, he had texted the Wife subsequently, stating “Never mind if you bought it. As long as we divide the money, it would be ok.” and clarified that what he meant in the text message was as long as the family car was sold and the money divided, it would be ok. [^50]

40     Given that the Husband had consented to the proposed plan, I find that the Husband has not proven on balance of probabilities that the Wife had disrespected his wishes in relation to the family car or that he was infuriated with her.

#### (2)   Transfer of Monies from the Joint Bank Account

41     The Husband alleges in his pleadings that the Wife had transferred the sum of $66,000 from their joint account without his approval into her own account.[^51] However, in his affidavit the Husband claimed instead that the Wife had transferred the entire sum of $66,000 into the children’s account without informing him.[^52] This was after the Wife had filed a defence clarifying that she had informed him she would transfer the monies to the children’s bank accounts for the educational expenses prior to the said transfer.[^53] In support of his allegations, the Husband exhibited a bank statement from parties’ joint account showing three consecutive outgoing transfers made on 23 August 2018 in the sums of $40,000, $13,000 and $13,000 respectively.[^54] The Husband further claimed that it was after he shifted out of the home a year later and transferred money to his daughter’s account that he knew of her account.[^55]

42     Of the $66,000 transferred out of the joint bank account, the Wife testified that $40,000 had been transferred erroneously into parties’ joint account from the Husband’s Company account.[^56] She had intended to transfer monies for the application of a Visa Credit Card which would generate higher interest. However, instead of transferring $2000, she had erroneously entered $20,000 instead.[^57] The Husband had to call the bank to either block the transaction or transfer the $40,000 back to his Company account.[^58] In support of this, the Wife highlighted 2 earlier bank transfers of $20,000 made on the same day into parties’ joint account. The Wife further testified that for the transfer to be made from the account, an OTP number would be sent to the Husband’s telephone number followed by a code, which would be required for any transfer transactions.[^59] As for the remaining $26,000, the Wife admitted having transferred to the children’s account the sum of $13,000 each.[^60] The Wife claimed that the Husband had been informed and was aware of the relevant transfers. I note further that all the transfers had taken place on the same day.

43     Counsel for the Husband submitted that the Wife had lied in her testimony. As parties joint account was an “and/or” account, the Wife would have been able to transfer monies out of the joint account unilaterally without the Husband’s involvement.[^61]

44     In order to have a better understanding of the evidence provided, it is important to reproduce the relevant extract here.[^62] When asked by the Husband’s counsel how the Wife had informed the Husband of the transactions, the Wife stated as follows:

I already told him before and that he had to be present. He will be informed by the bank before the _transfers_ could be done. Because he had to be around so that I could obtain the PPO number for the transfer. Since I made the wrong transfer he had to approve before the sums could be transferred back to _the account_. \[emphasis mine\]

Q:

 | 

Ms. Hong, please---Ms. Hong, please remember you are on oath here. Isn’t this an and/or account? That means any one of you can do the transaction.

 |
| 

A:

 | 

But _this account_, the PPO numbers were regis---was registered under his name.

 |
| 

Hussain:

 | 

Your Honour, I believe there is a correction again. It’s a OTP number I believe.

 |
| 

A:

 | 

The OTP number was registered under his telephone number. And there was also a code followed by the OTP number. On---only with that, both the OTP number and the code before a sum could be transferred. And he was aware that I have transferred wrongly, so he would have to call his bank to block the transfer. He was aware and he has to give his instructions before---before any transaction could be carried out.

45     From the Wife’s testimony, it is apparent that “the account” she is referring to is the Husband’s Company account, since it is the account to which the sums are to be transferred back. Her subsequent evidence therefore must be understood in the context of the Husband’s Company account. This is reinforced by her subsequent testimony that as she “had transferred wrongly, so he would have to call the bank to block the transfer”. I note further that the Husband’s counsel’s question does not redirect the Wife back to parties’ joint account but assumes instead that it is the account the Wife is referring to. I find this to be erroneous.

46     It is undisputed that the Husband is the sole proprietor of the Company. It makes complete sense therefore for the OTP number to be registered under the Husband’s telephone number and sent to the Husband’s telephone number for the authorisation of any transactions from the Husband’s Company account. I find it unbelievable therefore that the Husband would be unaware of the said transfers, given that the transfers were made from his Company’s account. It is worth noting from the text messages exhibited between the Husband and the Wife, that the Husband’s telephone number is not displayed in his personal name, but that of his Company.

47     In light of the above, I found the Wife’s evidence to be credible. As such, I find that, on a balance of probabilities, the Husband has failed to prove his allegations against the Wife.

#### Paragraph 1(e) of the SOP: After the Husband had informed the Wife of his intention to divorce her, did the Wife express an intention to have the matrimonial flat to herself and tell the Husband to move out of the flat? Did she then retain the Husband’s wallet, passport, keys to his van, joint-ATM card and Ipoh house keys and demanded a sum of S$30,000 in exchange for the return of those items to the Husband?

48     The Husband essentially painted a picture of the Wife as a woman who was more interested in the financial position of parties pursuant to the divorce than in salvaging the marriage. He painted a picture of the Wife as a person who would have consented to the divorce if he had acceded to her requests for money and the matrimonial flat. [^63]

49     With regard to the sum of $30,000, the Husband testified that after informing the Wife of his intention to end the marriage, he could not leave the house as the main door was locked and he did not have the key. In return, the Wife had asked him for the sum of $30,000 before she gave him the house key. The next morning, she opened the door and he issued a cheque for $30,000 to the Wife. [^64]

50     The Wife admitted that she had asked to retain the matrimonial flat. However, this was in response to the Husband’s proposals in relation to the division of the matrimonial assets. She denied retaining the Husband’s wallet or the keys to his van and the Ipoh House. With regards to the Husband’s passport, she admitted that she did not return it to him. As for the joint-atm card, it had always been in her possession. [^65]

51     With regard to the sum of $30,000, the Wife’s evidence is that she had told the Husband if he was going to leave the matrimonial home, to leave her and the children a sum of money for the family’s expenses. However, the Husband issued her a cheque of $30,000 on his own accord and left it on the table.[^66] While the Wife was upset and taken aback by the Husband’s request for a divorce, she was also concerned about what would happen to the family and whether the Husband would continue to support and provide for the needs of family once he left the matrimonial home.[^67] The Wife’s evidence was that she did not want the divorce.[^68]

52     The following is undisputed by parties:

> (a)     After the Husband left the house, he cancelled the cheque of $30,000 that had been issued to the Wife.[^69]

> (b)     In December 2019, the Wife ceased to work for the Husband’s Company, at the Husband’s request. She subsequently applied for and was granted a Maintenance Order for herself and the children sometime in December 2019. According to the MO, the Husband was ordered to pay her $2000 per month for each of the children, $500 per month for herself and up to 270 per month for the son’s maths tuition. He was also ordered to pay for the household utilities, cable TV and internet, and conservancy charges for the home.[^70]

> (c)     The Wife was upset when the Husband asked her for a divorce and had acted in the manner alleged by the Husband as she was venting her frustrations to the Husband.[^71]

> (d)     The Wife loves the Husband.[^72]

53     I note further from the text messages exhibited in the Husband’s affidavit between the Husband and the Wife, that although the Wife had indicated in an earlier message that “I want all”, she had also expressed her unwillingness to end the marriage by asking the Husband “You really want a divorce? You really want to give up this family?” and “Have you thought of the children”.[^73] She also sent various messages through text asking the Husband to return home to talk about the divorce.[^74]

54     In light of the evidence provided, I am unpersuaded by the Husband’s submission that the Wife’s behaviour, which occurred pursuant to him announcing his intention to end the marriage, was unreasonable. From the evidence provided, it is clear that the Wife was affected by the Husband’s decision to end the marriage. Her actions are consistent with that of a spouse who, while having to deal with her own emotions over the loss of a marriage, also has to cope with practical considerations such as the change in the household structure and family’s financial circumstances pursuant to the dissolution of parties’ union.

### Whether the Wife’s behaviour was such that the Husband could not reasonably be expected to live with her?

55     Overall, I found that the Wife’s behavior was not of such a nature that the Husband could not reasonably be expected to live with her. In fact, from the evidence provided, I found that the Husband either accepted or acquiesced in the Wife’s behaviour. It did not appear to me from the evidence that he had moved out of the flat because he found the Wife’s behavior intolerable. Rather, he moved out because she had asked him to, after he had informed her of his intention to end the marriage.[^75]

56     When prompted by the Court as to whether there was a deeper underlying reason for initiating the divorce after twenty years of marriage, the Husband answered “did not treat his parents well” and that he wanted to be filial to his parents and expressed grief that his mother had not visited his house in Singapore until today.[^76] It was clear to me that the Husband did desire for his immediate family to have a closer relationship with his parents. However, as mentioned earlier, there is insufficient evidence for me to conclude on a balance of probabilities that the Wife had behaved in a manner that alienated the Husband from his family. The desire of the Husband to be a filial son while commendable is not a ground in itself to grant a divorce.

57     As a closing note, counsel for the Husband had submitted that there must be reciprocity in a marriage in the way in-laws are treated and that a family nucleus in a marriage is not just limited to the couple and their children alone.[^77] Counsel for the Wife on the other hand submitted that at the end of the day, a marriage is between the parties solely and to impose such a positive duty on a spouse to his or her in-laws would be too onerous.[^78]

58     It is pertinent at this juncture to highlight Section 46 of the Women’s Charter which states as follows:

>     Upon the solemnization of marriage, the husband and the wife shall be mutually bound to cooperate with each other in safeguarding the interests of the union and in caring and providing for the children.

59     Both the Husband and the Wife have a duty to co-operate with each other in order to safeguard the interests of their marriage and in caring and providing for their children. How parties intend to carry this out is a matter of privacy between both parties. For example, whether or not to incorporate extended family members or to focus on the immediate family nucleus is a matter that only the couple themselves can decide on. What is important is the co-operation between parties in order to safeguard the interests of their union and in caring and providing for their children. Communication is key.

60     Where parties do not expressly communicate and reach a mutual understanding as to how they are to co-operate with each other in safeguarding the interests of the marital union and in caring and providing for the children, it is not uncommon that the role each plays in the marriage evolves over time and parties sometimes find themselves in a situation where each may take a more pro-active role in different aspects of the marriage, be it in caring and providing for the children, arranging holidays or visits to extended family etc.

61     There is insufficient evidence in the present case to show that the Husband had issues in the course of the marriage with the manner in which these decisions or arrangements were being made over time and that the Wife had acted unreasonably.

## Conclusion

62     For the reasons stated above, I found that the Husband has not proven his case on a balance of probabilities and I dismissed the Writ For Divorce.

63     For costs, the Wife prayed for $2000 including disbursements. The Husband did not object and accepted the amount prayed for. As such, I ordered the Husband to pay the Wife costs of $2000 including disbursements.
