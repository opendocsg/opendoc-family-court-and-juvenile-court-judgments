Family law – Summons for Stay of Executive of Judgement/Order

20 March 2020 - Judgment reserved.

### District Judge Chia Wee Kiat:

## Background

1       FC/SUM 148/2020 (“SUM 148”) is the Husband’s application for “a stay of the execution of the Judgment” pronounced by this court on 27 December 2019.

2       The parties were married on 1 March 2003 and an Interim Judgment of Divorce was granted on 26 September 2018 by reason of the Husband’s adultery. The parties have two children who turn 8 and 11 this year.

3       The ancillary matters (“AM”) first came up for hearing before me on 6 September 2019. The matters that required determination were:

> (a)     custody, care and control of the children;

> (b)     access to the children;

> (c)     division of matrimonial assets; and

> (d)     maintenance for the children.

4       At the further hearing on 25 October 2019, I reserved my decision to give full consideration to the parties’ submissions. On 27 December 2019, I rendered my written grounds setting out my orders with respect to each of the AM and the accompanying reasons. These written grounds are published in the redacted judgment _VDN v VDO_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGFC 146</span>.

5       The Husband filed Notice of Appeal on 9 January 2020 against the whole of the decision given on 27 December 2019.

6       On 13 January 2020, the Husband filed the present application (SUM 148) for a stay of execution. SUM 148 was heard before me on 5 March 2020 and judgment was reserved.

7       I now set out my decision in respect of this application and the accompanying reasons.

## Husband’s Position

8       The Husband’s position may be summarised as follows:

> (a)     Firstly, a stay of the judgment will not deprive the Wife of the fruits of her litigation[^1] for the following reasons:

>> i.       The Wife has not furnished any proposal or parenting plan pertaining to her weekday afternoon care of the children nor attempted to take over the care of the children on weekday afternoons.[^2]

>> ii.       The bulk of the children’s expenses and house expenses are still being borne directly by the Husband.[^3]

>> iii.       There are no orders or agreement on the mechanics of the division of matrimonial assets.[^4]

> (b)     Secondly, there are special circumstances to justify a stay[^5] as follows:

>> i.       The welfare of the children ought to be the court’s paramount consideration.[^6]

>> ii.       The care arrangements (and consequently maintenance orders) and the division of assets ought to be stayed pending the outcome of the Husband’s impending appeal to minimise unnecessary disruptions and impact on the children’s lives in the event that the Husband’s appeal is granted.[^7]

>> iii.       The children have expressed their wishes to maintain the status _quo quo_ due to insecurity and distress over the uncertainties in their weekday ferrying arrangements and care arrangements after school upon hearing of the judgment.[^8]

>> iv.       The detrimental effect on the children’s emotional wellbeing is irreversible.[^9]

>> v.       The appeal is not weak or hopeless.[^10]

>> vi.       The grant of a stay is unlikely to expose the children to danger or other serious prejudice.[^11]

>> vii.       Should the Husband move out of the matrimonial home and the paternal grandparents cease care of the children on weekday afternoons, there would be tremendous detriment and stress to the children’s physical, educational and emotional welfare in this period.[^12]

> (c)     Thirdly, the Husband’s appeal would be rendered nugatory if the stay is not granted because of the irreversible detriment due to the physical, emotional and psychological distress caused to the children.[^13]

> (d)     Fourthly, there would be no prejudice to the Wife resulting from a stay of the judgment.[^14] Given that parties are indeed maintaining _status quo_ in terms of living arrangements and the children’s care arrangements, granting a stay of the judgment would merely be putting on record the _de facto_ present arrangement to give certainty in view of the upcoming appeal.[^15]

## Wife’s Position

9       The Wife’s position may be summarised as follows:

> (a)     The alleged merit or strength of the Husband’s appeal does not constitute special circumstances which would warrant the granting of a stay[^16], and in any event, the Husband’s appeal is not strong.[^17]

> (b)     The Husband has merely repeated and reiterated arguments that had already been considered by the court.[^18]

> (c)     The Husband’s dissatisfaction with the care and control orders is not a reason for a stay to be granted.[^19]

> (d)     Contrary to the Husband’s assertion, it was the Husband who has refused to discuss any matters with the Wife and he has simply insisted on his ways thus impeding her time with the children.[^20] The Husband’s insistence on having his way has resulted in the Wife being unable to make any arrangements to help the children get accustomed to their new norms of their parents being divorced.[^21] The Husband should not be allowed to delay matters further and should allow the Wife and the children to get accustomed to the realities of their lives post-divorce.[^22]

> (e)     The stay is purely for the Husband’s satisfaction as he maintains that he intends to move out.[^23]

> (f)     There is no basis for the Husband to take the position that there should be a stay on the orders for maintenance given that he himself took the position that he would pay in the event that the Wife was granted care and control.[^24]

10     The Wife further submits that the Husband has not identified any special circumstances that would warrant a stay of execution of the orders. He has merely repeated his arguments for care and control.[^25] In fact, the circumstances that the Husband relies on for a stay evidence a pressing need for the orders to be carried out such that the Wife and the children can move on with their lives.[^26] The Husband has created a toxic environment in the matrimonial home and is delaying effecting the orders on the division of assets despite clearly stating that he intends to move out of the property.[^27] The environment is affecting the children and is clearly not in the children’s best interests.[^28] The Husband has even resorted to taking videos of the Wife in the morning to use it out of context. This is an invasion of the Wife’s privacy and is unhealthy for the children and the Wife to have to endure.[^29] The Husband’s presence in the house subsequent to the divorce has caused the children and the Wife to constantly be on edge as they are at the mercy of his moods.[^30] The Husband has involved the children and is now making them pick sides.[^31]

11     The Wife further submits that the appeal will not be rendered nugatory. Given that both parties work, the Husband would still enjoy weekly overnight access that would allow him time with the children.[^32] With regard to maintenance and division of assets, the court can order the Wife to repay any amount that it deems necessary in the event that the Husband is successful in his appeal.[^33] The prejudice that the Wife would suffer if the stay is granted would be tremendous as the children and her would have to continue to endure the current toxic environment.[^34]

## Analysis

12     Section 34(1) of the Family Justice Act 2014 (No. 27 of 2014) (“FJA”) provides as follows:

> An appeal from a Family Court exercising civil jurisdiction shall not operate as a stay of execution or of proceedings under the judgment or order appealed from, unless the Family Court or the High Court so orders.

13     In the Written Submissions, the Husband has repeatedly framed the application as a _stay of the judgment_.[^35] I should point out that this is, strictly speaking, incorrect as s 34 of the FJA refers to a stay of _execution of the judgment_ and not a stay of the _judgment itself_. There cannot be a stay of a judgment which has been rendered. The appropriate manner for a judgment to be challenged is _via_ the appellate process. This distinction is important as it means that an application for a _stay of execution of the judgment_ is not an occasion to re-litigate the correctness of the judgment.

14     The principles applicable for stay of execution pending appeal are summarised in _Strandore Invest A/S and others v Soh Kim Wat_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGHC 174</span> (“_Strandore_”) as follows:

> 7    The principles governing a stay of execution pending appeal are well settled and have been authoritatively set out in a number of decisions, including the decision of the Court of Appeal in _Lian Soon Construction Pte Ltd v Guan Qian Realty Pte Ltd_ \[1999\] 1 SLR (R) 1053. They are as follows:

>> (a)    While the court has the power to grant a stay, and this is entirely at the discretion of the court, the discretion must be exercised judicially, _ie_, in accordance with well-established principles.

>> (b)    The first principle is that, as a general proposition, the court does not deprive a successful litigant of the fruits of his litigation, and lock up funds to which he is _prima facie_ entitled, pending an appeal. There is no difference whether the judgment appealed against was made on a summary basis or after a full trial.

>> (c)    This is balanced by the second principle. When a party is exercising his undoubted right of appeal, the court ought to see that the appeal, if successful, is not nugatory. Thus a stay will be granted if it can be shown by affidavit that, if the damages and costs are paid, there is no reasonable probability of getting them back if the appeal succeeds.

>> (d)    The third principle follows, and is an elaboration of the second principle, that an appellant must show special circumstances before the court will grant a stay.

> All other rules follow and are derived from the application of these three principles to the individual circumstances and facts of each case. For example, the likelihood of success is not by itself sufficient, and a bald assertion of the likelihood of success in an affidavit is inadequate. Otherwise, a stay would be granted in every case because every appellant must expect that his appeal will succeed. Finally, it is neither possible, nor desirable, to give a catalogue of all the circumstances that would qualify to be considered as special. The court in every case will have to examine the facts to see if special circumstances justifying the grant of a stay of execution exist based upon the application of the three principles.

15     At paragraph 10 of the judgment, the court elaborated further as follows:

> In applying the above principles, it has been said time and again that **the fact that there are strong grounds for appeal is not a reason for granting a stay**, e.g, _Lee Kuan Yew v Jeyaretnam J B_ \[1990\] 1 SLR (R) 772, _Denis Matthew Harte v Dr Tan Hun Hoe & Gleneagles Hospital Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] SGHC 19</span>. **The special circumstances must be circumstances which go to the enforcement of the judgment and not to its validity or correctness**, see _Che Wan Development Sdn Bhd v Cooperative Central Bank Bhd_ <span class="citation">\[1989\] 3 MLJ 40</span> at 44 and _Dr Kok Chee Min v Kan Choy Yoong & Ors_ <span class="citation">\[1994\] 3 MLJ 210</span> at 217. However the converse is not necessarily true. If there is little merit in the appeal, it is a relevant circumstance that a Court can take into account. Many an appellant will harbour sanguine views on their prospects of appeal, but if a Court is able to assess objectively that there is little merit, that mut be a relevant consideration to put into the balance. It is usually not the only factor, but there can be circumstances where it can be a major factor.

> (emphasis in bold added)

16     In his supporting affidavit,[^36] the Husband states that the stay is “absolutely necessary” and proceeded to recount matters relating to the care arrangements of the children that had been canvassed at the AM hearing. The Husband also sought to introduce additional evidence including a handwritten note from \[H\][^37] (the older child) and a video recording[^38] - all of which, it would appear, is intended to show that the children would be better off being looked after by the Husband and his parents than by the Wife.[^39]

17     Insofar as these assertions and evidence are introduced to re-litigate the matter, they are irrelevant. As noted in _Strandore_ (at \[10\]), the special circumstances justifying the grant of a stay of execution _must be circumstances that go to the enforcement of the judgment and not to its validity or correctness_. Insofar as these assertions and evidence are introduced to show that there are strong grounds for appeal, they are also irrelevant: _Strandore_ (at \[10\]); _Lee Kuan Yew v Jeyaretnam J B_ \[1990\] 1 SLR (R) 772 (at \[6\]).

18     The fundamental question that needs to be answered is this - Are there special circumstances that go to the enforcement of the AM orders?

19     It would appear that the main argument put forth by the Husband that goes to this specific issue lies in his assertion that irreversible harm would be caused to the children if there is a change to their daily routine and that it would be in the best interests of the children to maintain the _status quo_ in terms of their living and care arrangements.

20     However, it is necessary to point out that a stay of the execution of the AM orders does not mean that the living and care arrangements of the children will continue in the manner dictated by the Husband. In the absence of any court order regulating custody, care and control, the law expects both parents to co-operate to promote the children’s best interest. This would require both parties to agree on the living and care arrangements of the children pending the outcome of the appeal.

21     It is encapsulated in the AM orders that parties may work out the access arrangements themselves. As I have explained in the Grounds of Decision (“GD”), no one is in a better position to help the children lead normal and happy lives in the post-divorce family than the parents themselves. Decisions made by the parties themselves allow for greater flexibility that is necessary to cater to changes to the schedules of the parties, the changing needs of the children and the vicissitudes of life that can never be fully anticipated in a court order. At paragraph 22 of the GD, I stated as follows:

> For the above reasons, my orders on access are intended first and foremost to encourage the parties to work out the access arrangements themselves. This will require both parents to co-operate but I have no reason to doubt that they would not place the needs of the children before their own. Hence, it is only in the event that they are unable to agree will the specific access orders prescribed by the court prevail. Whilst it would have been preferable for the parties to decide for themselves, these specific access orders would nonetheless provide a pragmatic way for the parties to move forward should they face an impasse.

22     No purpose is served by staying the AM orders when the effect of the stay leads the parties back to the same outcome provided in the AM orders, _i.e._ that parties are to work out the access arrangements themselves. In the event that the parties are unable to co-operate, the specific access orders set out in the AM orders help provide clarity in terms of how they may move forward. This will minimise dispute and acrimony should they face an impasse. Hence, I find no special circumstances to warrant a stay.

23     More importantly, the parties need to understand that the wellbeing of the children is in their hands. As noted in the Report of the Committee to Review and Enhance Reforms in the Family Justice System dated 13 September 2019 at page 11:

> 21.    Divorces are traumatic for all parties, especially for the children involved. Studies have shown that depending on the child’s maturity and understanding of what has taken place, the impact of the parents’ divorce continues to be felt by the child in each developmental stage. It may affect the child’s personality, the ability to trust and cope with change and expectations about relationships.

> 22.    The ability of divorcing couples to anticipate the changes that will arise from the divorce, to manage their own emotional and mental stress, and to communicate well with each other can have a significant bearing on the outcomes of children caught in divorce.

24     As observed by Debbie Ong J in _AZB v AZC_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHCF 1</span> (at \[3\]), the discharge of parental responsibility requires the hard work and personal sacrifices of both parents in reducing conflict and minimising their acrimony, if any, between themselves. As emphasized in _VDZ v VEA_ \[2020\] SGHCF2 (at \[46\]), an important aspect of parental responsibility is facilitating the child’s relationship with the other parent.

25     The process of self-healing and protecting the children from the negative effects of family breakdowns is never easy, but the parties can cushion the blow for the children and help them transit to the post-divorce life if both parents could encourage the children’s relationship with the other parent positively through their words and deeds.

26     Unfortunately, the supporting affidavit of the Husband reveals an intent on the part of the Husband to frustrate the court orders on care and control by triangulating the children into the conflicts of the adults. I note that there is also a propensity on the part of the Husband to take photos and videos of the Wife and the children at home for court proceedings. The lack of insight on his part into such damaging behaviour is troubling. Both parties have alleged that it was the other party who has refused to discuss. In my view, the parties will benefit from counselling to help them understand the impact of divorce on their children, address dysfunctional familial relationships and manage co-parenting issues.

27     In summary, I find that there are no special circumstances to justify the granting of a stay. As such, the application is dismissed.

28     In exercise of my powers under s 26(9) of the FJA, I am making an order for the parties to undergo counselling by the Family Justice Courts’ Court Family Specialist. For the avoidance of doubt, I should make it clear that the sole purpose of the counselling is to help the parties understand the impact of divorce on their children, address dysfunctional familial relationships and manage co-parenting issues. I should remind parties that counselling is a confidential process. What is said and disclosed by any party during the counselling, including any documents or other forms of information exchanged, shall not be disclosed or used in any court proceedings.
