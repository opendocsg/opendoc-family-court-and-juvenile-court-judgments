Family law – Variation of Order

18 November 2019

### District Judge Chia Wee Kiat:

## Introduction

1       FC/SUM 2859/2019 (“SUM 2859”) is the Plaintiff’s application for a variation of orders dated 26 April 2017 and 16 August 2017 (“26 Apr and 16 Aug 2017 orders”) relating to the custody, care and control of a child whom I shall refer to in this judgment as “E”.

2       The Plaintiff is the father and the Defendant the mother. They are not married. In this judgment, I shall refer to them as the “Father” and the “Mother” respectively.

3       The Father is an Australian citizen and a Singapore Permanent Resident. The Mother is a Japanese citizen. The child E holds both Australian and Japanese citizenship. When E was 2, the parties relocated to Singapore with E. E spent the next 7 years in Singapore and in December 2014, the parties arranged for E to study in Japan.

4       The parties have been embroiled in protracted litigation over E since 2015 when the Mother filed an application on 28 December 2015 in MSS5536/2015 for child maintenance. This was soon followed by the Father filing OSG 40/2016 on 8 March 2016 seeking _inter alia_, the return of the child to Singapore.

5       To date, there have been no less than 6 published judgments relating to the parties: _UHB v UHA_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGFC 131</span>; _UHB v UHA_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGFC 134</span>; _UHA v UHB_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHCF 27</span>; _UHB v UHA_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGFC 26</span>; _UHA v UHB_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGFC 63</span>; _UHA v UHB_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHCF 12</span>. E is now 14 years of age; the Father is now married, though not to the Mother.

6       SUM 2859 was heard before me on 18 October 2019. In addition, three other applications were also placed for hearing before me in the same month: FC/SUM3051/2019 (“SUM 3051”), FC/SUM3606/2019 (“SUM 3606”) and FC/SUM3635/2019 (“SUM 3635”).

7       In SUM 3051, the Father applied for an order of committal of the Mother for contempt of the 26 Apr and 16 Aug 2017 orders made by the learned District Judge Wong Keen Onn (“the DJ”). I heard the committal application on 11 and 23 October 2019 and found the Mother guilty of contempt of court for her breach of paragraph 2 of the order of court dated 16 August 2017. The Mother was sentenced to a fine of $2,000 in default 4 days’ imprisonment. She paid the fine in full.

8       SUM 3606 was also the Father’s application. In this application filed on 17 October 2019, the Father applied for a stay of the DJ’s orders made on 28 August 2019 (“28 Aug 2019 orders”), which varied the earlier 26 April and 16 Aug 2017 orders. Under the 28 Aug 2019 orders, the DJ granted the Mother care and control of E and permitted the Mother to bring E to Japan on or after 31 October 2019.

9       SUM 3635 is the Mother’s application filed on 21 October 2019 to vary aspects of the 28 Aug 2019 orders relating to the child’s passports. She filed this application soon after the Father filed SUM 3606.

10     SUM 3606 and SUM 3635 were both fixed for urgent hearing before me on 29 October 2019. The Mother was due to relocate with E on 31 October 2019 and E was due to start school in Japan on 5 November 2019. Having considered the submissions of the parties, I was unable to find any special circumstances to warrant a stay or material change to warrant a variation. Accordingly, I dismissed both applications on the same day.

11     With respect to SUM 2859, I made no order on the application and provided brief oral grounds explaining my decision. As the Father has appealed against my decision in SUM 2859, I now set out my reasons in full.

12     This judgment is confined to SUM 2859 as the parties did not appeal against my decision in SUM 3051, SUM 3606 and SUM 3635.

## Background

13     This case is intensely litigated. For the purpose of this judgment, I shall refer only to the facts and circumstances that are necessary to provide the context to SUM 2859.

14     At the hearing of OSG 40/2016 on 26 April 2017, the DJ ordered the Mother to return the child to Singapore by 1 July 2017 and granted the parties joint custody and shared care and control of the child (“26 Apr 2017 orders”). The Mother appealed against the DJ’s decision _vide_ HCF/DCA 122/2017 (“DCA 122”) after obtaining an extension of time to file the appeal. In the meantime, in compliance with the 26 Apr 2017 orders, the Mother returned the child to Singapore on 1 July 2017.

15     On 16 August 2017, pursuant to an application made by the Father in FC/SUM 2759/2017 (“SUM 2759”), the DJ made further orders that provide, _inter alia_, for the Father to be allowed to decide on the primary school where the child is to be registered (“16 Aug 2017 orders”). The Mother appealed against this decision _vide_ HCF/DCA 119/2017 (“DCA 119”).

16     The 26 Apr and 16 Aug 2017 orders are the subject matters of the Father’s application in SUM 2859.

17     DCA 122 and DCA 119 were dismissed by the Family Division of the High Court on 15 May 2018.

18     On 7 December 2018, the Mother filed FC/SUM 4370/2018 (“SUM 4370”) to vary the 26 Apr and 16 Aug 2017 orders due to a material change in circumstances. In brief, SUM 4370 is a relocation application to bring E to Japan.

19     The DJ was informed that since August 2018, E has not been able to attend school as she has not been granted a student pass to study in Singapore. The Immigration and Checkpoint Authority of Singapore (“ICA”) has ordered E and the Mother to leave Singapore which date was originally set on 7 January 2019, but that has been extended temporarily due to the court proceedings.[^1] Not unexpectedly, the Father resisted the Mother’s application.[^2]

20     SUM 4370 was heard on 27 February 2019 and 7 August 2019 and scheduled for delivery of decision on 23 August 2019. Hearing dates on 2 and 4 July 2019 were vacated as the Father was on medical leave.[^3]

21     On 20 August 2019, the Father filed FC/SUM 2859/2019 (“SUM 2859”) to vary the 26 Apr and 16 Aug 2017 orders to allow him, _inter alia_, to have care and control of the child. It is significant to note that this was just three days before the DJ was scheduled to deliver his decision in SUM 4370. With this application, the Father now tussles for sole care and control.

22     On 22 August 2019, the Father filed FC/SUM 2860/2019 (“SUM 2860”) seeking for the DJ’s decision in SUM 4370 to be reserved until after, or to be given together with the decision in respect of the Father’s application in SUM 2859.

23     On 28 August 2019, the DJ dismissed SUM 2860. The DJ noted that the application was filed very late. The Mother’s application has already taken 8 months as various summons applications were filed by the Father to adduce further affidavits. The DJ has also called for a Custody Evaluation Report. The Father did not offer any satisfactory reason why he took so long to file SUM 2859. As E has not been in school for more than a year, it is in the best interests of E to quickly resolve the impasse and to consider the realistic options immediately available to send E to school. The DJ found the late filing by and insistence of the Father that his summons be heard first to be an abuse of process.[^4]

24     The DJ granted the Mother’s relocation application in SUM 4370. The Mother was also granted care and control of the child. In his oral grounds, the DJ noted that E herself has expressed her wish to go to Japan to study. E, at 14 years of age, was intelligent and of sufficient maturity to articulate her views.[^5]

25     As such, the original custody, care and control orders encapsulated in the 26 Apr and 16 Aug 2017 orders have been substantively varied and superseded by the 28 Aug 2019 orders.

26     The Father filed an appeal _vide_ HCF/DCA 113/2019 (“DCA 113”) on 11 September 2019 against the DJ’s decision in respect of SUM 4370.

27     It is against this backdrop that SUM 2859 came up for hearing before me on 18 October 2019.

## Preliminary Issue

28     At the hearing on 18 October 2019, the Father raised a preliminary issue “in terms of case management” as to whether SUM 2859 should be heard at this stage, or be adjourned and transferred to be heard by the Family Division of the High Court together with DCA 113, as a result of the determination of SUM 4370 and pending the hearing of the appeal.[^6] The Father submits that it will be more appropriate for the application to be transferred to be heard together with the appeal.

29     Section 29(1) of the Family Justice Act (Act 27 of 2014) (“FJA”) provides as follows:

> The High Court or a Family Court may, either on its own motion or on the application of any party, order any proceedings in a Family Court to be transferred to the High Court, if it appears to the High Court or Family Court (as the case may be) that those proceedings, by reason of involving some important question of law or of being a test case, or for any other sufficient reason, should be tried in the High Court.

30     Rule 843(1) of the Family Justice Rules (“FJR”) provides as follows:

> An application under Section 29(1) of the Family Justice Act (Act 27 of 2014) must be made by summons to the Registrar.

31     As the Father is making an application under s 29(1) of the FJA, he ought to have filed a summons as required by rule 843(1) of the FJR. As the Father did not file a summons, there is no properly constituted application for the court’s consideration.

32     The court is therefore left to consider the matter “on its own motion”. I did not however find any reason to transfer the proceedings to the Family Division of the High Court. The Father’s application in SUM 2859 involves neither a test care nor some question of law. There is also no reason to transfer SUM 2859 “in terms of case management”. The delay in filing SUM 2859 was a result of the Father’s own doing. As noted above, the DJ has found the late filing by and insistence of the Father that his summons be heard first to be an abuse of process.

33     By seeking to have SUM 2859 transferred to the Family Division of the High Court to be heard together with DCA 113, the Father is in effect seeking to achieve what he has failed to achieve before the DJ. This is unacceptable; this court simply cannot countenance such an abuse of process.

34     Furthermore, it should be noted that the parties will have a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal if SUM 2859 is heard at first instance in the Family Division of the High Court. In contrast, any further appeal from the decision of the Family Division of the High Court in DCA 113 requires leave of court. Having both SUM 2859 and DCA 113 heard together complicates matters unnecessarily and might even be prejudicial to the parties as different rights of appeal apply. From a case management perspective, such a situation is unsatisfactory and should be avoided as far as possible.

35     Having dealt with the preliminary issue, I turn now to the substantive application.

## Applicable legal principles

36     Section 5 of the Guardianship of Infants Act (Cap. 122) (“GIA”) provides as follows:

> The court may, upon the application of either parent or of any guardian appointed under this Act, make orders as it may think fit regarding the custody of such infant, the right of access thereto and the payment of any sum towards the maintenance of the infant and may alter, vary or discharge such order on the application of either parent or of any guardian appointed under this Act.

37     Whilst s 5 of the GIA provides for the variation of a custody order, it is silent as regards the requirements: see _ATZ v AUA_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 161</span> (at \[102\]). This may be contrasted with s 128 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353) (“WC”) which provides as follows:

> The court may at any time vary or rescind any order for the custody, or the care and control, of a child on the application of any interested person, where it is satisfied that the order was based on any misrepresentation of fact or mistake of fact or where there has been any material change in the circumstances.

38     Under s 128 of the WC, the test for variation is based on misrepresentation of fact, mistake of fact or material change in circumstances. The Father submits that although s 128 of the WC is not applicable to the present case as the parties were never married and E is not a “child of the marriage” under s 92 of the WC, it has nevertheless been applied in a case involving unmarried parents: _UVM v UVN_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGFC 56</span> (at \[6\]) and \[10\]).[^7]

39     I agree with and accept the Father’s submission that the relevant test applicable to the present case is whether there has been a material change in circumstances. Although s 128 of the WC is strictly speaking not applicable to the present proceedings, there is no reason why the test enunciated in s 128 of the WC could not be adopted in a variation application under s 5 of the GIA. Fundamentally, the subject matters are the same - both are concerned with variation of custody, care and control and access orders relating to children. In principle, whether an application is taken out under s 5 of the GIA or s 128 of the WC, there should not be any significant difference in approach. This is especially so given the fact that the GIA and WC speak with one voice, which is that the paramount consideration is the welfare of the child (see s 3 of the GIA and s 125 of the WC).

40     More pertinently, I should point out that there is in fact judicial authority that considered the power of the court to vary an order for the custody of a child under s 5 of the GIA. This arose in _Soon Peck Wah v Woon Che Chye_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 3 SLR(R) 430</span> where the Court of Appeal framed the issue (at \[23\]) as follows:

> The crux of the appeal was whether there was a change of circumstances such that it merited a variation of the custody order.

41     The test as framed by the court clearly envisages the change of circumstances to be material as it would not otherwise merit a variation of the custody order. This decision lends support to the view that the test applicable to the present case is material change in circumstances.

42     Finally, I should also point out that the burden is on the applicant seeking a variation to prove that there has been a material change in circumstances: see _ATS v ATT_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGHC 156</span> (at \[10\]).

## Material change in circumstances

43     The Father submits that the main issue to be determined is:[^8]

> Whether the Original Order[^9] and the Further Order[^10] should be varied to allow the Child to remain in Singapore.

44     With respect, I do not think this is a correct framing of the issue. Bearing in mind that SUM 2859 is an application to vary the 26 Apr and 16 Aug 2017 orders, the issue correctly framed is as follows:

> Whether there has been any material change in circumstances to warrant a variation of the 26 Apr and 16 Aug 2017 orders.

45     When framed in this manner, the problem with the Father’s application in SUM 2859 becomes immediately apparent - there are no 26 Apr and 16 Aug 2017 orders that are capable of being varied. This is because the 26 Apr and 16 Aug 2017 orders have been substantively varied and superseded by the 28 Aug 2019 orders. By framing the issue the way he did, the Father is in effect seeking a variation of the 28 Aug 2019 orders for which an appeal is already pending.

46     However, SUM 2859 is not concerned with the 28 Aug 2019 orders. SUM 2859 is concerned only with the 26 Apr and 16 Aug 2017 orders which are no longer in existence at the time of the hearing. Until and unless the Father succeeds in the appeal, the only orders before this court are the 28 Aug 2019 orders.

47     In the circumstances, I was on the view that the appropriate order to make in respect of the Father’s application in SUM 2859 is no order. I shall explain why.

## Why no order is appropriate

48     An order of “no order” is somewhat of a misnomer as it is an “order”. In _Sinwa SS (HK) Co Ltd v Nordic International Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGCA 63</span> (“_Sinwa_”), the Court of Appeal made the following observations (at \[41\]):

> Second, we respectfully disagree with the Judge’s statement that there was no order which the Appellant could appeal (at \[10\] of the GD (\[21\] _supra_)). The Judge’s decision to make no order on the Appellant’s application for summary judgment itself constituted an “order” from which the Appellant could appeal. In the same way that an order of “no order” had legal effect from the date it was made, it must equally be capable of being the subject matter of an appeal provided that the right of appeal is available.

49     In _Sinwa_, the Court of Appeal held (at \[28\]) that O 14 r 3(1) of the Rules of Court which stipulates that the court “_may_” give summary judgement for the plaintiff does not preclude the court from making no order on the application. In the present case, s 5 of the GIA provides that the court “_may_” alter, vary or discharge a custody order. By a parity of reasoning, s 5 does not preclude the court from making no order on an application for variation.

50     Indeed, it is not uncommon for an order of “no order” to be made in guardianship proceedings: see _Re Aliya Aziz Tayabali_ <span class="citation">\[1992\] 3 SLR(R) 894</span>; _Re G (guardianship of an infant)_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 1 SLR(R) 229</span>.

51     As there is a variety of situations that may give rise to “no order”, the effect of an order of “no order” depends on the particular circumstances of each case. For example, in _Tohru Motobayashi v Official Receiver_ \[2000\] 3 SLR (R) 435 (cited at \[38\] & \[41\] in _Sinwa_), the Court of Appeal held that the effect of “no order” made by the Judicial Commissioner below was that he had disallowed the application. In _Sinwa_, it was held (at \[38\]) that an order of “no order” made in respect of a summary judgment application was in substance similar to an order giving leave to defend. In _CX v CY_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 3 SLR 690</span>, the Court of Appeal held (at \[18\] & \[19\]) that “no custody order” is not tantamount to depriving both parents of custody and that the practical effects of a “no custody order” and “joint custody order” are similar. In _APE v APF_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGCA 47</span>, the Court of Appeal held (at \[2\]) that an order to the effect that there was “no order” on the wife’s application for maintenance would have resulted in a rejection of the wife’s application for maintenance and would have therefore precluded her from applying for maintenance should such a need to do so arise in the future. In matrimonial proceedings, it is also not uncommon for the court to make no order as to costs. A relevant consideration in such cases is the courts’ desire to minimise acrimony and discontent between the parties. The effect of such orders is that parties would bear their own costs: see _JBB v JBA_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHCF 6</span> (at \[24\]-\[26\]).

52     In the present case, SUM 2859 was filed before the 26 Apr and 16 Aug 2017 orders were varied by the 28 Aug 2019 orders. As such, I do not think it is correct to dismiss SUM 2859 notwithstanding the fact that the 26 Apr and 16 Aug orders have since been varied by the 28 Aug 2019 orders to the extent that there are no longer any 26 Apr and 16 Aug 2017 orders that are capable of being varied. In my view, the more appropriate order and fairer approach to take is to make no order. This is simply to reflect the fact that SUM 2859 has been overtaken by events.

53     In making no order, I made it clear that I have not made any determination as to the substantive merits of the application. The order is made without prejudice to the Father making a fresh application in the event that he succeeds in his appeal to set aside the 28 Aug 2019 orders.

54     Given the above circumstances, I also made no order as to costs.
