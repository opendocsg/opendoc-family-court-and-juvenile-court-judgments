Civil Procedure – Service – Substituted service

Civil Procedure – Judge-led approach

12 October 2020

### Assistant Registrar Tan Zhi Xiang:

## Introduction

1       This was an application for substituted service made under rather unusual circumstances. The Wife (the applicant in this case) and the Husband filed writs for divorce against each other at roughly the same time. The Husband first served his writ on the Wife after obtaining an order for substituted service. The Wife _then_ sought to serve her writ on the Husband by way of substituted service. However, she expressly stated in her application that she did not object to both divorce proceedings being consolidated and heard together.

2       In these circumstances, I did not think it was necessary for the Wife to serve her writ on the Husband, given that she is entitled to file a counterclaim in the proceedings commenced by the Husband. Applying the judge-led approach, I dismissed the Wife’s application for substituted service. As the Wife has appealed against my order, I furnish the detailed grounds of my decision.

## Background

3       As this was an _ex parte_ application, I assume that the facts stated in the Wife’s affidavit are accurate.

4       On 21 August 2020, the Husband filed his writ for divorce in Divorce No 3586 of 2020 (“D 3586”).

5       On 25 August 2020, the Wife received a letter (dated 21 August 2020) from the Husband’s solicitors informing that they had instructions to commence divorce proceedings against the Wife. However, the letter did not specify the suit number of the Husband’s writ, and the Wife assumed that the Husband had not in fact filed his writ.

6       On 28 August 2020, the Wife filed her writ in Divorce No 3724 of 2020 (“D 3724”).

7       On 31 August 2020, the Wife’s solicitors wrote to the Defendant’s solicitors asking if they had instructions to accept service of the Wife’s divorce papers on behalf of the Husband. The Husband’s solicitors responded to state that the Husband had already commenced D 3586. However, they did not confirm whether they had instructions to accept service on behalf of the Husband.

8       The Wife then made two attempts to serve the papers personally on the Husband on 3 and 8 September 2020, but these attempts were not successful.

9       The Husband obtained an order for substituted service and effected service of his divorce papers on the Wife (in D 3586) on 9 September 2020.

10     About a week later, on 17 September 2020, the Wife filed the present application for substituted service.

11     The Wife then entered an appearance in D 3586 on 22 September 2020.

## The Wife’s case

12     In her supporting affidavit, the Wife stated that she instructed her solicitors to file the present application because “substantial work had already been done in the preparation of my divorce papers and legal fees had already been incurred.”[^1] At the hearing, ccounsel also cited the example of a not uncommon situation where two parties file cross applications (originating summonses or summons), and the Court allows both applications to proceed to hearing simultaneously.

## The law

13     The Family Justice Rules 2014 (S 813/2014) (“FJR”) do not set out precisely the requirements for an application for substituted service. It is only set out in general terms at r 901:

> **Substituted service**

> **901**.—

>> …

>> (3)    Substituted service of a document, pursuant to an order made under this rule, is effected by _taking such steps as the Court may direct to bring the document to the notice of the person to be served_.

>> (4)    For the purposes of paragraph (3), the steps which the Court may direct to be taken for substituted service of a document to be effected include the use of such electronic means (including electronic mail or Internet transmission) as the Court may specify.

> \[emphasis added\]

14     It is also stated at paragraph 79(1) of the Practice Directions:

> (1)    In any application for substituted service, the applicant should persuade the Court that the proposed mode of substituted _service will bring the document in question to the notice of the person to be served_.

> …

> \[emphasis added\]

## My decision

15     The principal ground on which I dismissed the application was that service of the divorce papers in D 3724 was unnecessary and would have resulted in the incurring of additional legal costs for no good reason. The Wife has already entered an appearance in D 3586. Divorce proceedings are therefore already well under way and the service of further divorce papers would only result in further duplication of work.

16     I consider that this is a decision which I was entitled to make under the judge-led approach:

> **Power to make orders and give directions for just, expeditious and economical disposal of proceedings**

> **22.**—(1)    Despite anything in these Rules, the Court, when dealing with any cause or matter, is to adopt a judge led approach —

>> (a)    to identify the relevant issues in the cause or matter; and

>> (b)    to ensure that the relevant evidence is adduced by the parties to the cause or matter.

> (2)    In adopting a judge led approach, the Court may, at any time after the commencement or at the hearing of any proceedings, of its own motion or on an application by any party to the proceedings, direct any party or parties to those proceedings to appear before it, for the Court to make such order or give such direction as it thinks fit, for the just, expeditious and economical disposal of the cause or matter.

> …

17     It is clear from the opening words of r 22(1) that the judge-led approach applies notwithstanding the other rules in the FJR. Thus, _even if_ r 901 can be interpreted to mean that the Court _must_ grant an application for substituted service as long as the broad requirements are made out, the said rule is still subject to the Court’s overarching case management powers under r 22(1). It is also evident from the above extract that under the judge-led approach, the Court has the power to identify the relevant issues in the proceedings and make any direction as it thinks fit for the just, expeditious and economical disposal of the cause or matter. I dismissed the application as I took the view that service of the papers in D 3724 became moot after the Wife was served in D 3586. I also took the view that this outcome would be most expeditious and economical for the disposal of the proceedings.

18     If I had allowed the application, additional work would be done and legal costs would be incurred for no good reason. Conversely, the dismissal of the Wife’s application will not prejudice the Wife. There is no first-mover advantage in divorce proceedings. This applies to both stages of proceedings – the divorce and the ancillary matters. At the first stage, the Wife, as the defendant in D 3586, is very much entitled to file a counterclaim on the same terms as the claim which she had intended to serve in D 3724. Like any plaintiff in divorce proceedings, she will have a final right of reply in the reply to defence to counterclaim (if necessary). I thus disagreed with the submission that the application should be allowed because work has already been done in D 3724 – any work that has already been done can be used for the counterclaim in D 3586 (if any).

19     Furthermore, at the second stage of the divorce proceedings, where the Court deals with the ancillary matters, the Court will have regard to the welfare of the child as well as the factors set out in sections 112 and 114 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed). In other words, the Court will take a holistic view of the facts. It therefore does not and will not matter whether the Wife is the plaintiff or defendant, or whether the Wife has served divorce papers on the Husband.

20     As stated above, counsel also cited the example of a non-uncommon situation where two parties file cross applications (originating summonses or summons), and the Court allows both applications to proceed to hearing simultaneously. However, as I explained at the hearing, this will typically be the case where both applications have been served. This case is different because the writ in D 3586 has been served, while the writ in D 3724 has not. In the circumstances, I see no reason for the Court to perpetuate the duplication of work by giving directions for the service D 3724. There is only one marriage and there can only be one divorce. It would make no sense for the Court to set in motion a second set of divorce proceedings when the first is well under way.

21     I note that the Wife has no objection to having both D 3586 and D 3724/2020 consolidated and heard together. However, it is the Court’s practice to consolidate divorce suits under the one that is filed first in time, which in this case would be D 3586. Thus, there would be no point in allowing D 3724 to proceed when the outcome, regardless of how this application is decided, is that the proceedings would be heard under D 3586.

22     I am aware that the judge-led approach “is not a licence for the court to interfere with the substantive rights of parties, or take away any procedural rights which affect the parties’ substantive remedies”: _UDA v UDB and another_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1433</span> at \[37\]. However, I have explained at \[18\] and \[19\] above that the dismissal of the application would have absolutely no effect on the Wife’s substantive rights in the divorce proceedings.

## Conclusion

23     I accept that the Husband could have acted more graciously in accepting service of the papers in D 3724, and I can understand why the Wife feels very strongly that she should be allowed to serve her divorce papers on the Husband. But ultimately, these are not good reasons for the Court to perpetuate the duplication of work done, which would result in the incurring of legal costs unnecessarily and indeed, the unwarranted expenditure of Court resources. In my judgment, if the judge-led approach is to have any teeth, it must be interpreted as enabling the Court to prevent any party from taking steps which ultimately add absolutely nothing substantive to the issues at hand. Accordingly, I dismissed the application.
