Ancillary Matters – Shared Care and Control of young children – division of matrimonial assets – maintenance

14 February 2020

### District Judge Geraldine Kang:

## Brief Background

1       For ease of reference, parties shall be referred to Husband (34 years old) and Wife (32 years old) in this written grounds of decision.

2       Briefly, parties were married sometime in July 2011 and there are 2 young children borne to their union – a 7 year old son and a 5 year old daughter. Interim judgement was granted sometime in August 2018 on the basis of the respective claims and counterclaims of unreasonable behaviour. At the time of the hearing before me, the son was in Primary 1 and the daughter was attending kindergarten at a childcare centre in the immediate vicinity of the matrimonial flat.

3       During the course of the marriage, both parties worked and relied on either 3rd parties to provide support and help towards the caregiving arrangements of their two young children – be in the form of childcare centres, domestic helper and/or the maternal grandmother.

4       Sometime in July 2018 the Wife moved out of the matrimonial flat with the children, and into her mother’s home (ie. The children’s maternal grandmother); which was approximately 20 minutes away from the matrimonial.[^1] The Husband continued to reside in the matrimonial flat.

5       During the course of the marriage, it would appear that the Husband was the primary breadwinner, contributing to the finances of the family. The Husband took on several odd jobs such as debt collector, providing valet services, and at the time of the hearing was a waiter at a nightclub earning approximately $1,200 per month (excluding tips and allowance). In an effort to supplement his income, the Husband had applied for a vocational taxi licence[^2]. After moving out, the Wife took on part time employment as a waitress in a pub. The irregularity and late working hours led her to change employment by the time of the hearing before me – she was employed as a corporate sales officer but did not adduce any evidence in support until sought by the court.

6       Parties were however able to reach a mediated consent access order in relation to their young children before a District Judge sometime in July 2018 (“**Interim Consent Order**”). Briefly, the recorded consent terms are summarised below:

> (a)     The Husband to have access to the children every Saturday from 10am to Sunday 10am, with liberty to have the domestic helper accompany the children.

> (b)     The Husband is to fetch the children from the maternal grandmother’s house every Saturday.

> (c)     The Wife is pick the children from the matrimonial home every Sunday at 10am and return that same evening by 9.30pm to let the children sleep in the matrimonial home so that the children can go to school conveniently the next day.

7       Having heard their respective submissions, a summary of the ancillary orders made by myself is as follows:

> (a)     Parties are to have joint custody of their 2 children.

> (b)     Parties shall have shared care and control of the children, with each parent to have care and control of the children for 2 weeks at a time. Each parent is to maintain their children while they are in their respective care and control.

> (c)     There shall be no maintenance for the Wife.

> (d)     The Wife to transfer her share of the matrimonial flat to the Husband, upon the Husband paying her a sum of $87,341.97 (reflective of a 40% share of the matrimonial assets awarded by the court) within 3 months from the date of the order. The Wife was to refund her own CPF from this sum.

> (e)     If the Husband was unable to make the above cash payment to the Wife, the matrimonial flat was to be sold in the open market within 6 months from the date of the order. Parties were to have joint conduct of the sale and the net proceeds of the sale were to be apportioned 60% to the Husband and 40% to the Wife; and each party were to make their respective CFP refunds from their respective shares of the sale.

> (f)     Each party to retain their respective assets in their own name.

8       The Wife is now appealing against the entirety of my decision.

## (1)   The Wife’s Proposal

9       In this regard, the mother sought for the Interim Consent Order to be followed. She wanted care and control of the children awarded to her, with weekend overnight access to the Father and for the children to reside at the matrimonial home on Sunday evenings for their ease of convenience in getting to school the next Monday morning.

10     The Wife urged the Court to consider the status quo in so far as the children’s caregiving arrangements had been in place since July 2018 – when she moved out with the children and subsequently entered into the Interim Consent Order.

11     She cast aspersions on the Husband’s parenting ability and level of involvement by citing his nonchalance in so far as letting the pet dog attack the son, amongst other allegations of him being nonchalant and uncaring towards the children’s needs.[^3]

12     She sought a sum of $1,200 as monthly maintenance for herself; and a monthly sum of $1,700 as maintenance for the 2 children. In addition, she sought that the Husband reimburse her 50% of the children’s education and medical related expenses within one month upon her production of receipts.

13     In respect of the matrimonial flat, she sought that it be sold in the open market and that the net proceeds of the sale be divided 70% to herself and 30% to the Husband, with each party making their respective CPF refunds with accrued interests from their share of the net sale proceeds.

14     The Wife’s Counsel informed that whilst the Wife was not eligible to retain the matrimonial flat, she had plans to buy or rent one in the same vicinity.[^4]

## (2)   The Father’s Proposal

15     The Husband was seeking to reverse the Interim Consent Order and sought care and control of the children, with reasonable access to the Wife instead. He argued that the status quo was one that was unilaterally imposed on him and that was not to be cast in stone. Further he also claimed that the Wife was uncooperative and that he faced difficulties with his access to the Children under the Interim Consent Order, to the extent that he had to initiate a separate summons for the insertion of a penal clause to ensure her compliance.

16     The Husband took pains to highlight to the court that the Mother has since the marriage broke down, got involved in 2 new relationships and introduced the children to her new partners. The Husband’s submission on this point was that he was better able to provide the children a more stable and nurturing environment. He alleged that it was not in the children’s interests for care and control of the children to be awarded to the Wife as she was simply not committed to spending time at home with the children but instead pursuing her own relationships outside the home and delegating the care of the children.

17     He disagreed that he should be paying her any maintenance but was agreeable to paying a monthly sum of $400 as maintenance for both his children should care and control not be awarded to him.

18     In respect of the matrimonial flat, his proposal was for the Wife’s share in the matrimonial flat to be transferred to him so that he could continue living in it with the children (again premised on his desire to have care and control of the children). If however, care and control was granted to the Wife, he would like the option of buying over the Wife’s share of the matrimonial home; or if it to be sold in the open market should be he unable to retain it. In this regard, he was seeking an apportionment of 80% to himself and 20% the Wife.

## (3)   Children’s Interests – The Law

19     It is trite law that Section 125 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353) was the applicable law when the court has to make orders for the welfare of children in situations of marital breakdown. The case authorities in this area are often cited and continue to evolve.

20     The seminal decision of the Court of Appeal in **_CX v CY (minor: custody and access)_** **<span class="citation">\[2005\] 3 SLR(R) 690</span>** explains the concepts of “custody” and “care and control” (at \[31\]):

> … where parties are splitting up, custody as a general concept is divided into two smaller packages, _ie_, ‘care and control’ and residual ‘custody’. … \[R\]esidual ‘custody’ is the package of residual rights that remains after the grant of a care and control order that dictates which parent shall be the daily caregiver of the child and with whom the child shall live. To put it simplistically, ‘care and control’ concerns day-to-day decision-making, while residual ‘custody’ concerns the long-term decision-making for the welfare of the child.

21     “Custody” thus pertains to decision-making over the major aspects of a child’s life, such as the child’s education and major healthcare issues. Where joint or no custody orders are made, both parents must consult each other and co-operate to make the major decisions for the child. Such orders ensure that the child continues, even after the parent’s divorce, to have the guidance of both parents in his or her life.

22     “Care and control”, on the other hand, relates to which parent the child should live with primarily, with that parent as the daily caregiver. Consequently, that parent is generally responsible for making day-to-day decisions for the child, such as how the child is to dress or what the child is to eat. In most cases, the child will also spend regular periods of time with the other parent through an arrangement known as “access”. Access can take many forms. Where the child is not yet completely comfortable spending time alone with that parent, access may be supervised by professionals such as counsellors who will also assist in strengthening the parent-child relationship. Access may also be overnight, where for example, the child stays at the residence of that parent for one or some nights a week. When the parent with access is with the child, he or she can make some of the day-to-day decisions for the child, as it would be otherwise impractical for the parent with care and control to be consulted on every decision, such as what the child should eat during periods of access.

23     In **_TAU v TAT <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHCF 11</span>_**, Justice Debbie Ong embarked on an insightful discussion on shared care and control orders. Such orders are not common but there is a place indeed for such orders; and every case is to be determined on its own facts and merits.

> _Shared care and control_

> \[11\]  It is common that a parent is granted sole care and control of a child while the other parent has access to the child. **In appropriate cases, the court may grant both parents shared care and control if this is feasible and determined to best serve the child’s welfare.** In such cases, the child may spend about three days of the week with a parent and the remaining four days with the other parent. **Each parent will be responsible for day-to-day decision-making for the child when the child is living with him or her.** The child will effectively have two homes and two primary caregivers in this arrangement: _AQL v AQM_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 840</span> at \[8\]. To be clear, shared care and control is different from joint custody; the former relates to the child living with both parents, while the latter is about joint decision-making over major decisions affecting the child.

> \[12\]  As I have explained above, the legal constructs of custody, care and control, and access are used to support families where the child’s parents have separated. Intact, functioning families do not need such interventions. The ideal state is understandably for a child to be in an intact family where he or she lives with and is lovingly cared for jointly by both parents. Yet, upon the breakdown of a marriage, this is simply no longer fully achievable. The family justice system nevertheless aspires to achieve the ideal state of affairs for the child, or the closest to it possible. But to ignore the realities, including the parental conflict, the parties’ emotional baggage and the new dynamics of the various relationships, and impose in all situations a modified version of the perceived ideal (such as equal-time shared parenting or shared care and control) can do more harm than good. **Thus in considering whether shared care and control would be in the child’s welfare, the court will have to consider factors such as that particular child’s needs at that stage of life, the extent to which the parents are able to co-operate within such an arrangement, and whether it is easy for that child, bearing in mind his or her age and personality, to live in two homes within one week.**

> **…**

> \[20\] **There is thus neither any legal principle against shared care and control, nor a legal presumption that this arrangement is always in a child’s welfare. Where such an arrangement is suitable for a child in his or her developmental stage of life, considering his or her relationship with each parent and all relevant circumstances, such an order may be made for the child’s welfare.** Whatever the arrangements ultimately made, parents must recognise that they must “place the needs of their children before their own”: _TAA v TAB_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 2 SLR 879</span> at \[18\].

**\[my emphasis added\]**

24     Justice Ong declined to make an order for shared care and control for the 4 year old child in question.

## (4)   My orders

25     A shared care and control order was not sought by either party but in my opinion, such an order were in the children’s best interests and the circumstances of the present case allowed for this order to be implemented.

26     On the facts of this case and in the interests of both the children, I granted both parents shared care and control. It bears reiterating that every family is different. The circumstances they face are unique to them, more so in such periods of transition; and yet the only constant is that the welfare of the children must take precedence over the rights and convenience of the parents.

27     Despite the allegations that both parents were making of each other’s parenting and lifestyle choices, the level of acrimony that was postured in the affidavits and legal submissions, did not take away the fact that **_both_** of them were able to put aside their differences to co-parent in the interests of the children. The Wife acknowledges the stability that both children need and the convenience to them; and hence she has no issues with the children continuing to reside with the Husband at the matrimonial flat. Clearly, the Father was not an unfit parent and was able to see to the needs of the children attending school on a school day. The Wife had no issues with the children picking the children up on a Sunday morning and returning them to him again that very same evening, as it was for their convenience of going to school the next Monday morning.

28     I echo Justice Ong’s observations and concerns with respect to shared care and control orders, and that such orders are not the common or typical orders but it doesn’t mean it is not in the children’s best interest. Even under the Interim Consent Order, the reality was that the children were indeed staying in two households within the week. The fact that they resided at the matrimonial flat over the weekends (including Sunday evenings) and during the weekdays, they stayed at the maternal grandmother’s. They would still have to pack their homework, sets of uniforms and other school necessities as they returned to the respective residences. There was no evidence to suggest that both children were not in fact adjusting well to the arrangements in the 2 households at present.

29     Despite the breakdown in their marriage and the allegations made of each other in the affidavits, the reality is that they appeared to be able to co-parent effectively in the interests of the children. For instance, the Wife picking up the children on Sunday morning and returning them to the matrimonial home in the same evening for the children’s benefit, and even involving the maternal grandmother, the domestic helper and childcare centre – as the saying goes, it takes a village to raise children. And if the support network exists post-divorce, it would certainly still be in the children’s interests for all parties (even 3rd parties caregivers) to continue to play the supporting role(s) they played prior to the breakdown of the marriage.

30     In this instance, both parties are working parents who rely on 3rd party caregivers (be it grandparents, domestic help or childcare centres) to help out with their children – this was not a bad thing and neither does it reflect any shortcomings on their part as parents who are able to discharge their parenting responsibilities. Thus, I viewed this as a neutral point which even intact families may also rely on.

31     Save for little domestic disagreements, I do not see any compelling reason why the Husband should not be granted equal time with the children especially since there is no compelling reason to order otherwise. There were no allegations of abusive, unfit or neglectful parenting. It would certainly be in the interests of the 2 young children to spend equal amount of time with both parents where both parents expressed a genuine desire and commitment to them even after the breakdown after the marriage. If there was no desire or commitment from a parent to spend time with the child, I do not see any court making a shared care and control order as that would simply not be in the child’s interest – you can bring a horse to the river stream but you simply cannot force it to drink from it. As I observed, the Husband did express a desire to play an involved role in his children’s lives and was prepared to make adjustments to his work commitments as well.

32     The ages of the children was also a significant consideration. As the children grew up and progressed in formal education, it would come to a point that CCAs and/or other activities would fill up their day. Before it reached this point, and if both parents are willing and committed to be a more involved parent, I did not see why either parent should be deprived of this opportunity to be more involved in the day to day arrangements and interactions. Further, the issue of maintenance was also to be shared equally in this situation as there was no significant disparity in their respective incomes.

33     In my opinion, a share care and control would be in the interests of both children as this would give them time to know and spend time with both their parents and for both parents to discharge their parent responsibility to their children as fairly as possible in these transitional times where adjustments on all fronts are expected.

## (5)   Division of Matrimonial Assets - The Law

34     The law relating to the power of the court to order division of matrimonial assets is stipulated in Section 112 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353):

> (_1_)     _The court shall have power, when granting or subsequent to the grant of a judgement of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage, to order the division between the parties of any matrimonial asset or the sale of any such asset and the division between the parties of the proceeds of the sale of any suchy asset in such proportions as the court thinks just and equitable._

> (_2_)     _It shall be the duty of the court in deciding whether to exercise its power under subsection (1) and, if so, in what manner, to have regard_ to all the circumstances of the case, including the following matters:

>> (_a_)     _the extent of the contributions made by each party in money, property or work towards acquiring, improving or maintaining the matrimonial assets;_

>> (_b_)     _any debt owing or obligation incurred or undertaken by either party for their joint benefit or for the benefit of any child of the marriage;_

>> (_c_)     _the needs of the children (if any);_

>> (_d_)     _the extent of contributions made by each party to the welfare of the family, including looking after the home or caring for the family or any aged or infirm relative or dependant of either party;_

>> (_e_)     _any agreement between the parties with respect to the ownership and division of the matrimonial assets made in contemplation of divorce._

>> (_f_)     _any period of rent-free occupation or other benefit enjoyed by one party in the matrimonial home to the exclusion of the other party;_

>> (_g_)     _the giving of assistance or support by one party to the other party (whether or not of a material kind), including the giving of assistance or support which aids the other party in the carrying on of his or her occupation or business; and_

>> (_h_)     _the matters referred to in section 114(1) so far as they are relevant._

35     The Court of Appeal in **_ANJ v ANK <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span>_** gave guidance in relation to the structured approach for the division of assets under which courts will first ascribe a ratio that represents each party’s direct financial contributions towards the acquisitions of the matrimonial assets, relative to that of the other party. Next, the court will ascribe a second ratio which represents each parties’ indirect contribution to the well-being of the family. If the necessary, the court has a discretion to make further adjustments to this average ratio after taking into account the other factors set out in s 112(2) of the Women’s Charter as well as all relevant circumstances to arrive at a just and equitable division of the matrimonial assets.

## (6)   The Matrimonial Pool and its division

36     The matrimonial flat was purchased in parties joint names and they resided as a family in the flat up until the time the Wife moved out with their two children.

37     As indicated earlier, the Wife’s counsel informed that she was not eligible to retain the flat in her sole name but checks with by the Husband with the HDB indicated that the Husband was eligible to (upon certain conditions being fulfilled).

38     As at 12 September 2019, there was an outstanding loan of $181,145.08 and both parties were still financially contributing towards the mortgage of the matrimonial flat via their respective CPF accounts.[^5] Parties were not able to agree on a valuation of the flat and neither was a formal valuer appointed. Accordingly, the court was only able to base its calculations on an average of last transacted prices to arrive at an indicative value of the matrimonial flat.

39     A breakdown of their respective contributions towards the matrimonial flat is set out:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="0"><colgroup><col width="39.32%"> <col width="30.8%"> <col width="29.88%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Plaintiff</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Defendant</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Direct Contributions (Monthly mortgage via CPF)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$50,211.97</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>[36.1%]</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$88,940.51</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>[63.9%]</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Direct Payments – Home Renovations</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$5,000</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">(alleged)</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>[29.4%]</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$43,443.78</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">(substantiated)</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>[70.6%]</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Indirect Contributions</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">(Non-Financial)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>50%</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>50%</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Average</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">39.7%</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">60.3%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Adjusted</b></p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>40%</b></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>60%</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

40     The Husband was the primary breadwinner working full time and longer hours; whereas the Wife was working part time. They were fortunate that they did have a supportive network of help in the caregiving arrangements of their children. I ascribed an equal percentage of 50% each of their respective indirect contributions. Whilst it is not an exact science to ascribe a formula to determine indirect contributions (without it being an arbitrary figure), I made future adjustments in view of the undisputed external help that the couple had in terms of the maternal grandmother, domestic helper and childcare centre’s support and assistance whilst the couple was at work.

41     Save for the matrimonial flat, I did not regard the following items that were in their respective sole names as part of the matrimonial pool liable for division:-

> (a)     Insurance policies

> (b)     Single name bank accounts

Accordingly, I ordered that each party to retain these assets held in her respective sole name.

42     In conclusion, my orders were made against the context of a short marriage of lasting 7 years (as at the date of the Interim Judgement) but with 2 children borne to the union.

43     The proximity of the matrimonial flat to both the children’s schools and the convenience of it for the children were recognised by both parents. Accordingly, it would be ideal for the children as a matter of convenience and stability if they continued to reside at the matrimonial home. However, this factor alone was not also the determinative factor I took into account when awarding parties shared care and control of the children, and making the orders in respect of the matrimonial flat in favour of the Husband.

## (7)   Power of court to order maintenance

44     The law relating to the power of the court to order maintenance and the assessment of such maintenance is found in sections 113 and Section 114 (Cap. 353).

> Section 113

> (_1_)     _The court may order a man to pay maintenance to his wife or former wife, or order a woman to pay maintenance to her incapacitated husband or incapacitated former husband -_

>> _(a) during the course of any matrimonial proceedings, or_

>> _(b) when granting or subsequent to the grant of a judgement of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage._

> Section 114

> (_1_)     _In determining the amount of any maintenance to be paid by a man to his wife or former wife, or by a woman to her incapacitated husband or incapacitated former husband, the court shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the following matters:_

>> (_a_)     _the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future._

>> (_b_)     _the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;_

>> (_c_)     _the standard of living enjoyed by the family before the breakdown of the marriage;_

>> (_d_)     _the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage;_

>> (_e_)     _any physical or mental disability of either of the parties to the marriage;_

>> (_f_)     _the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family; and_

>> (_g_)     _in the case of proceedings for divorce or nullity of marriage, the value to either of the parties to the marriage of any benefit (for example, a pension) which, by reason of the dissolution or annulment of the marriage that party will lose the chance of acquiring._

> (_2_)     _In exercising its powers under this section, the court shall endeavour so to place the parties, so far as it is practicable and, having regard to their conduct, just to do so, in the financial position in which they would have been if the marriage had not broken down and each had properly discharged his or her financial obligations and responsibilities towards the other._

45     The Court of Appeal in _ATE v ATD <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGCA 2</span>_ enunciated specific principles in relation to the issue of nominal maintenance – put simply – it was sought to preserve the right of the wife to apply for substantive maintenance should the need arise in the future. It was clear to the Court of Appeal that:

> \[28\]  … **_The courts cannot – and ought not to – order nominal maintenance automatically or as a matter of course._**

> \[29\]… **_it will not suffice for the wife to argue – without more – that she is entitled to an order of nominal maintenance simply because her situation might change in the future_**. Indeed, it has, in general, never been the duty of the courts to compensate parties for **_the vicissitudes of life_**… This would be wholly _contrary_ to the very _purpose_ of awarding maintenance to a former wife in the first place – a point to which we will return shortly. For present purposes, it suffices to note that an application for nominal maintenance takes place in the context of a marriage that has already been **_terminated_**. In any event, it has never been – and ought not to be – the case that a party (let alone a _former_ spouse) has a duty to be a _general insurer vis-à-vis_ another party. Indeed, in order to provide for the vicissitudes of life, persons generally have recourse to the purchase of insurance policies.

**_\[Emphasis in original\]_**

46     At paragraph \[31\] of the same decision, the Court of Appeal also reiterated the underlying rationale and purpose for the award of maintenance generally to former wives was that of financial preservation. It was also observed with approval that an award of maintenance for a former wife takes into account the fact that a former wife ought to try to regain self-sufficiency and that an order of maintenance is not intended to create life-long dependency on the former husband.

## (8)   Wife’s Maintenance

47     As stated earlier, the Wife sought a monthly sum of $1,200 as maintenance for herself. I did not find that this was a reasonable sum given the Husband’s disclosed income on affidavits (for which no discovery application was taken out by the Wife and yet she invited the court to draw an adverse inference as to his income and ability to pay her the sought sum). It bears noting that she concedes that her present income was more than the Husband’s.[^6]

48     The Wife has also to her own credit, sought gainful employment after the breakdown of the marriage and was in a position to be self-sufficient and reliant.

49     Given that this was a short marriage of approximately 7 years and that parties were relatively young, in the prime of their employability and thus able to be self-sufficient and reliant. Against the background and totality of my shared care and control orders for the children, I believed that an order of no maintenance for the wife was also an appropriate one.

50     As for the children’s maintenance, I declined to impose a monthly maintenance obligation payable to either parent as I had ordered a shared care and control arrangement wherein the parent with the care and control should maintain the children whilst under their care. This was not only a practical and feasible arrangement, it would also impose parental responsibility on **_both_** parents for their children. Parental responsibility is one of the most fundamental family obligations in family law. Section 46 (Cap. 353) provides that “\[u\]pon the solemnization of marriage, the husband and the wife shall be mutually bound to co-operate with each other in safeguarding the interests of the union and in caring and providing for the children.” Needless to say, joint parental responsibility as imposes upon every parent the legal obligation to co-operate with the other parent in raising their children, even after the termination of their marriage.

## (9)   Decision

51     Accordingly, I made the orders I did and that each party were to bear their own costs.
