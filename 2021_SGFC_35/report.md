Family Law – Maintenance – Child – Due proof of neglect or refusal

29 April 2021

### Magistrate Sarah Chua:

## Introduction

1       This was an application by the complainant mother (the “Mother”) against the respondent father (the “Father”) for maintenance of their two-year-old twin boys (the “Twins”) under s 69(2) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed). The Mother alleged that the Father had neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the Twins since May 2019, and sought a sum of $6,500/month for both children.

2       The Mother’s case is summarised as follows:

> (a)     The children’s reasonable expenses amounted to $9,805/month, including actual and projected expenses.

> (b)     Parties should each bear the amount of maintenance directly proportionate to their relative income. Since the Mother’s take-home income was $2,785/month and the Father’s take-home income was $15,000/month, the parties’ income ratio was 15:85 (Mother: Father) and the Father should bear 85% of the children’s reasonable expenses.

> (c)     It was also relevant to consider that the parties had entered into an agreement known as the “Deed of Reconciliation”, under which the Father promised to pay the Mother “a minimum of $3,900” each month.

> (d)     The amount of reasonable maintenance which the Father should pay in this case was $6,500/month for the two children (comprising $3,250/month for each child), which was well within the 85% proportion that he should bear.

> (e)     Since the Father failed to provide such reasonable maintenance for the children since May 2019, a maintenance order should be made against him.

> (f)     The maintenance should also be backdated to account for the earlier shortfall.

> (g)     The maintenance should be deducted from the Father’s monthly salary in the form of an attachment of earnings order, in order to ensure timely payment.

3       The Father’s response was as follows:

> (a)     The children’s reasonable expenses were more accurately assessed at $2,183.05. The Mother’s figures were grossly inflated and were an attempt to unjustly enrich herself under the pretext of claiming for the children’s maintenance.

> (b)     The parties’ income ratio was more accurately reflected as 22:78 (Mother: Father).[^1] This was because the Father’s take-home income was effectively reduced to $12,585/month when his impending pay cut and annual Medisave contributions were taken into account. It was also appropriate to use the Mother’s gross income of $3,500/month as a basis for comparison.

> (c)     The Deed of Reconciliation should not be taken into account by the Court. It was a draft agreement that was exchanged on a without prejudice basis and was, in any event, not signed by the parties.

> (d)     The amount of reasonable maintenance which the Father should pay in this case was $1,500/month for the two children (comprising $750/month for each child). This was what the Father was able to afford, as his financial obligations amounted to $13,500/month.

> (e)     The Father reasonably provided such maintenance by purchasing daily essentials for the children in addition to transferring a monthly average of $1,390 in cash payments. Baby Bonuses amounting to $13,000 were also transferred to the Mother at the time. There was therefore no basis to make a maintenance order against him.

> (f)     Since the Father had not neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance, there was no reason to backdate maintenance. In view of the Father’s financial obligations, backdated maintenance would also cause serious financial hardship to him.

> (g)     There was also no basis to make an attachment of earnings order as it was a mechanism for enforcing an existing maintenance order. It could not be made where there was no maintenance order to begin with (as in the present case).

4       Having considered the evidence and submissions, I found that reasonable maintenance in this case was $1,500/month (rounded off from $1,482/month). On a practical approach, which involved a holistic consideration of the Father’s mode of provision and the circumstances in which maintenance was being provided, I found that the Father had reasonably provided such maintenance.

5       As the Mother had not shown due proof that the Father had neglected or refused to maintain the Twins, the legal threshold in s 69(2) of the Women’s Charter was not met for the Court to make a maintenance order against the Father. It was therefore not necessary for me to consider whether maintenance should be backdated or whether an attachment of earnings order should be made.

6       For these reasons, I dismissed the Mother’s application in its entirety. The Mother has since filed an appeal against my decision, and I set out my detailed reasons in these grounds.

## Background facts

7       The Mother and the Father, who were 34 years old and 37 years old respectively at the time of the hearing,[^2] had married in 2016.[^3]

8       From the start of their marriage, the parties were of an unequal financial footing. The Mother was from a well-to-do family. Her father was a multi-millionaire who owned a landed property worth about $3m, and had the capacity to provide his family with financial support.[^4] Before the Mother gave birth to the Twins, she had been working as a senior flight stewardess at a major airline where she was earning a wage of $6,500/month.[^5] The Father, on the other hand, was from a lower-income family where his elderly parents were retired and required financial support.[^6] Before starting work as a lawyer, he had spent some time completing his studies and took out study loans to do so.[^7] He first obtained a degree in Building, and later went on to complete a second degree in Law. It was not disputed that the Father had been in substantial debt since his first Building degree,[^8] and it was the Mother who had supported the Father financially prior to the marriage to assist him with his loans.[^9] The Mother had also paid for the Father’s share of wedding expenses, when he used up the monetary gifts from their wedding guests and did not have sufficient funds to pay the vendors.[^10] Although the Father now earns a substantial income of $15,000/month as a partner in a major law firm, he continues to face a considerable amount of fixed monthly liabilities (including loan repayments).

9       While the parties seemed to settle well into married life and started a family not long after their marriage, cracks in their family life appeared almost as quickly. In June 2018 (less than two years into their marriage), the Twins were born. In August 2018 (about two months after the birth of their Twins), the parties had a conflict which led to the Mother moving out of the matrimonial home (an Executive Condominium in District 19) with the Twins. The Mother and the Twins moved into the residence of the children’s maternal grandfather (the “Grandfather”), which was a multi-storey bungalow in District 15, where they continue to reside to-date. Litigation subsequently ensued between the parties, when the Mother filed an application for maintenance for herself and the two children in September 2018.

10     The parties’ subsequent attempts to reconcile were unsuccessful. In around November 2018, the parties exchanged drafts of an agreement on a without prejudice basis. The agreement was known as the “Deed of Reconciliation”, under which the Mother agreed to move back into the matrimonial home with the Twins. One of its terms stated that “\[the Father\] shall provide a minimum of at least $3,900.00 by way of monthly maintenance to the \[Mother\] for the expenses for her and the two children”. Further to the parties’ negotiations, the Mother also withdrew her maintenance application. The Deed of Reconciliation was, however, eventually not signed by the parties and neither party followed through on their respective obligations under the purported agreement. The parties’ relationship quickly turned acrimonious and they commenced divorce proceedings in the Syariah Court in May 2019.

11     Although the Father continued to transfer sums of money to the Mother and purchase daily essentials for the Twins during their separation, there were disagreements about whether this was sufficient for the children’s maintenance and whether the Father had neglected his maintenance obligations. Between January 2019 and June 2019, the Father had transferred sums of between $1,199 and $3,502 to the Mother almost on a monthly basis. The payments, however, ceased for a period of five months between July 2019 and November 2019.

12     As a result, further court proceedings ensued. The Mother filed the current maintenance application for the Twins in October 2019, on the basis that the Father had failed to provide reasonable maintenance for the children since May 2019.[^11] Although the Father resumed monthly payments of $1,500 to the Mother from December 2019, the circumstances leading to the arrangement were disputed by the parties. While the Mother alleged that the Father’s payments were made pursuant to an order granted at a court mention, the Father claimed that he was unaware of a court order being made. According to the Father, he was the one who had proposed making $1,500 monthly payments for the children at the court mention and the Mother had agreed to it.

13     By the parties' consent, the hearing before me proceeded by way of affidavit evidence and submissions (without cross-examination) further to r 115(9) of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (S 813/2014) (the “FJR”) and paragraph 26(1) of the Family Justice Courts Practice Directions.

## The Mother’s application

14     The Mother had applied for the following orders:[^12]

> (a)     That the Father pay maintenance of $6,500/month for the Twins (comprising $3,250/month for each child);

> (b)     That the Father make payment of backdated maintenance to account for the earlier shortfall; and

> (c)     That the maintenance amount be deducted from the Father’s salary every month.

## The issues

15     The key issues to be determined in the application were as follows:

> (a)     What was reasonable maintenance in the present case?

> (b)     Was there neglect or refusal to provide reasonable maintenance?

16     It was only if the Court found that the Father neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance and decided to make a maintenance order against him, that the further questions of whether maintenance should be backdated and whether an attachment of earnings order should be made would arise.

17     I address the issues above in turn.

## The law

18     The duty of parents to maintain their children is set out in s 68 of the Women’s Charter, which provides as follows:

> **Duty of parents to maintain children**

> **68**.    Except where an agreement or order of court otherwise provides, it shall be the duty of a parent to maintain or contribute to the maintenance of his or her children, whether they are in his or her custody or the custody of any other person, and whether they are legitimate or illegitimate, either by providing them with such accommodation, clothing, food and education as may be reasonable having regard to his or her means and station in life or by paying the cost thereof.

19     It is well-established in case law that both parents are equally responsible for providing for their children, although their precise obligations may differ depending on their means and capabilities (see _AUA v ATZ_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 674</span> at \[41\]).

20     In cases where a parent is found to have defaulted on his legal duty to maintain his child, the Court has the power to order that parent to fulfil his legal obligation. That power is found in s 69(2) of the Women’s Charter, which provides as follows:

> (2)    The court may, on due proof that a parent has neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for his child who is unable to maintain himself, order that parent to pay a monthly allowance or a lump sum for the maintenance of that child.

21     In ordering maintenance, the Court is required under s 69(4) of the Women’s Charter to consider all the circumstances of the case, including the following matters:

> (a)    the financial needs of the wife, incapacitated husband or child;

> (b)    the income, earning capacity (if any), property and other financial resources of the wife, incapacitated husband or child;

> (c)    any physical or mental disability of the wife, incapacitated husband or child;

> (d)    the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage;

> (e)    the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family;

> (f)    the standard of living enjoyed —

>> (i)    by the wife before her husband neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for her;

>> (ii)   by the incapacitated husband before his wife neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for him; or

>> (iii)   by the child before a parent neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the child;

> (g)    in the case of a child, the manner in which he was being, and in which the parties to the marriage expected him to be, educated or trained; and

> (h)    the conduct of each of the parties to the marriage, if the conduct is such that it would in the opinion of the court be inequitable to disregard it.

22     In _UHA v UHB and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 3 SLR 666</span> (“_UHA v UHB_”), the High Court emphasised that the court in making a maintenance order must first be satisfied that the parent has neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the child. Where one party takes out maintenance proceedings against another, it is easy to assume that there has been a neglect or refusal as the matter has escalated to the court. However, the burden is on the complainant to satisfy the court that the respondent has “neglected refused to provide reasonable maintenance for his child”. This is a legal requirement in s 69(2) of the Women’s Charter, and served as a safeguard against unnecessary intervention by the court in family matters. Where the legal requirement was not met, a maintenance order should not be made (see _UHA v UHB_ at \[43\], \[44\], \[72\] and \[73\]).

23     The High Court in _UHA v UHB_ also set out the following approach in determining whether the legal requirement in s 69(2) of the Women’s Charter had been met (at \[28\] and \[29\]):

> (a)     First, it was necessary to determine what “reasonable maintenance” was on the facts of the case.

> (b)     Second, after determining the quantum of reasonable maintenance, it was necessary to determine whether the other party had indeed provided such reasonable maintenance.

24     In assessing whether parties had reasonably provided such maintenance, the High Court in _UHA v UHB_ elaborated as follows (at \[45\] – \[50\]):

> (a)     The court takes a practical approach in assessing whether the parties had reasonably provided such maintenance.

> (b)     The court could consider “reasonableness” in several ways. First, the court could consider the reasonableness of the expenses in question. This went towards the quantum of maintenance. Second, the court could consider whether one party reasonably communicated the child’s needs to the other party. Third, the court could consider whether the paying party used a reasonable mode of provision of maintenance. The court would consider all the facts in making such assessments.

25     In _Foo Ah Yan v Chiam Heng Chow_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 2 SLR 506</span>, the Court of Appeal cited with approval (at \[22\]) the views of Professor Leong Wai Kum (“Professor Leong”) in her leading text, _Elements of Family Law in Singapore_ (LexisNexis, 2007), that the objective of s 69 applications is to provide “modest maintenance” to help the children overcome their “immediate financial need”.

26     In a later edition of her text, Professor Leong further observed that reported cases demonstrated that the amounts ordered for child maintenance are “fairly modest”, and that the most significant factors that a court is likely to consider are the financial needs of the child, and the ability of the parent, who is being sued for maintenance, to meet those needs (see Leong Wai Kum, _Elements of Family Law in Singapore_ (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2018) at paragraph 12.113).

## The decision

### What was reasonable maintenance in this case?

27     The factors which are relevant to determining the amount of reasonable maintenance are set out in s 69(4) of the Women’s Charter and in case law.

28     In the present application, the focus was primarily on the financial needs of the children, the parties’ respective financial positions, and the Deed of Reconciliation.

#### The children’s financial needs

29     I first begin with the children’s financial needs. In this regard, parties submitted a joint table of positions which was separated into “Children’s Expenses” (which I understood to mean “Current/Actual Expenses”) and “\[the Mother’s\] Projected Expenses”.

30     The breakdown of the claims, the parties’ positions and the Court’s assessment is as follows:

31     On the whole, I was unable to accept the Mother’s figures for a large number of items because they could not be justified on the facts and evidence presented to the Court. While it is not the case that the court requires proof of each and every single expenditure or expense, there must be sufficient evidential basis for the court to form a conclusion that the claim was justified in reality. The court’s decision must be firmly rooted in the evidence before it, and cannot rest on speculation or conjecture that is not borne out by objective facts.

32     I explain my assessment on each of the disputed items below.

##### (1)   Current/actual expenses

(A)   Food (including groceries)

33     The Mother’s position was that the children’s monthly expenses for food (including groceries) amounted to a ballpark figure of $750. According to the Mother, this was derived from her receipts and bank statements which she had submitted to the Court.[^14]

34     The Father’s position was that the amount should not exceed $300. According to the Father, the Mother had grossly inflated the expenses for the two two-year-old children, especially considering the fact that the Twins spent most of their time at the childcare centre where all their meals were provided for.

35     I agreed with the Father that a reasonable amount for this item was $300. On the facts, the Twins only had meals once at home in the evenings and on weekends,[^15] and the rest of their meals were provided for by the childcare centre where they spent 12 hours (7am to 7pm) each weekday.[^16] In addition, their milk expenses were covered under a separate claim in the table above. In addition, I was unable to accept the Mother’s figure of $750/month as the receipts and bank documents which she had submitted to support her claim were inconclusive. The Mother’s documents, which purported to set out the children’s expenses, contained payments which were unrelated to the children’s needs. If the Mother asserted that the children’s expenses were more than the $300 put forward by the Father, the burden was on her to prove her case with the necessary evidence and explanation — this was not done.

(B)   Milk

36     I accepted the Mother’s claim of $225 for milk expenses as it was supported by her receipts on the usual price of milk powder.[^17]

(C)   School fees

37     The Mother claimed an amount of $1,600 ($800 for each child) for school fees, which was based on the actual fees charged by the _private_ school in which the Twins were presently enrolled.[^18] According to the Mother, the children’s school was chosen due to its proximity to their current residence and it would not be in the children’s interest to be transferred to a different school to lower the maintenance amount.[^19] This was because the children had settled into the routine and lifestyle in the current school and neighbourhood.[^20] The Mother also claimed that the fees at the Twins’ current school was already relatively low compared to other private schools.[^21]

38     The Father submitted that $940.80 ($470.40 for each child), which was based on the fees charged by _public_ schools, was a reasonable amount for school fees.[^22] According to the Father, the amount claimed by the Mother was unfair for a number of reasons. First, the Twins were enrolled into the private school when they were barely one year old without his knowledge or consent.[^23] It was only pursuant to the Father’s application to the Syariah Court seeking disclosure of the name and location of the children’s school that he was informed of their enrolment.[^24] The Father relied on the case of _UHA v UHB_ to argue that it was not reasonable to expect him to provide more maintenance, when the Mother did not even inform him of the Twins’ enrolment. Second, the Father did not have the financial means to afford an expensive private school for the Twins.[^25] At the time the Twins were enrolled, the Father’s salary was about $10,000 and he had to service his outstanding loans and fixed monthly liabilities amounting to about $9,000.[^26] In the premises, it was unreasonable for the Mother to ask that the Father pay for a private school (which was almost double the fees charged by public schools).[^27]

39     I accepted the Father’s figure of $940.80 for the Twins’ school fees as the reasonable amount. Under s 69(4)(_g_) of the Women’s Charter, the Court is required to consider the manner in which parties to the marriage expected their child to be educated or trained. On the facts, however, there was little to no evidence to suggest that the parties expected the Twins to be educated at a private school. It was not disputed that the Mother had unilaterally decided upon the children’s private education and proceeded to enrol them into a private school when they were less than one year old, without the Father’s knowledge or consent. While I took into account the children’s routine and lifestyle (in particular, the fact that they were being raised by parents with a combined household income of about $18,000 and that they had been living in private housing from the time they were born), these were not enough for the Court to reach the conclusion that the parties _necessarily_ expected the children to be educated or trained in a private school. If the Mother asserted that the Twins were expected to be educated or trained in a private school, the burden was on her to prove her case with the necessary evidence and explanation — this was not done.

40     In the absence of evidence to show the parties’ intentions for the Twins’ education, it would be unfair to impose on the Father the expense of $1,600, which arose out of the Mother’s independent choice of school.

(D)   Transport

(I)    _The Mother’s position_

41     The Mother sought an amount of $900 for the Twins’ transport expenses, which consisted of $650 for the use of the Grandfather’s car (including petrol and miscellaneous car-related expenses) and $250 in private-hire car (Grab)/taxi fares.[^28] In support of the $650 claim for the use of the Grandfather’s car, the Mother submitted a letter, an IOU dated 5 July 2020, and monthly invoices which were purportedly issued by the Grandfather between August 2018 and July 2020 (hereinafter referred to as the “Grandfather’s Invoices”). These documents from the Grandfather purportedly set out the debts owed to him by the Mother for rental, utilities, shared costs and living allowances for the children’s necessities totalling $4,050 a month.[^29] According to the Grandfather’s Invoices, the Mother was being billed a total of $650/month for the use of the Grandfather’s car. In support of the $250 claim for in private-hire car (Grab)/taxi fares, the Mother tendered her bank statements and an Excel spreadsheet setting out taxi charges and numerous “Grab” transactions.[^30]

(II)    _The Father’s position_

42     The Father contested the $900 figure on the basis that it was for the Mother’s own use (and not the children’s), and submitted that $100 was reasonable for the Twins’ transport expenses.[^31] While he acknowledged that the Twins were ferried to and from school by the Grandfather, he stated that he was willing to ferry the Twins to and from school every day to save on transport costs.[^32]

43     The Father also disputed the authenticity of the Mother’s evidence, in particular the Grandfather’s letter, IOU and the Grandfather’s Invoices which purportedly set out the shared costs of living and the debts owing to the Grandfather as a result. According to the Father, these documents had been fabricated by the Mother in an attempt to inflate her maintenance claim.[^33] For example, it was telling that the date of the IOU (i.e., 5 July 2020) was the day before parties were originally directed to exchange their affidavits of evidence-in-chief.[^34] This demonstrated that the documents were only prepared as an afterthought, purely to support the Mother’s grossly inflated claims for these proceedings.[^35]

(III)    _My findings_

44     I did not accept the Mother’s claim as it was not supported by the facts. To begin with, I was unable to ascertain how the number of trips and distance travelled for the purpose stated justified the $900 figure. The Mother’s position was that the transport expenses were for sending the Twins to and from school every weekday (i.e., about 40 trips a month).[^36] This would mean that the transport expenses averaged at $22.50 per trip. Given that the Twins’ school was located in the proximity of their current residence,[^37] it was not clear to me why $900 was justified for this purpose.

45     Furthermore, I did not find that the Mother’s evidence was credible nor sufficient to support her claim. There was no objective documentary proof to show that the Mother was incurring $650 for the use of the Grandfather’s car. The Mother had relied only on the Grandfather’s letter, the IOU and the Grandfather’s Invoices, which were drawn up between herself and the Grandfather, to support this figure. During oral submissions, the Mother’s counsel confirmed that the Grandfather’s letter, the IOU and the Grandfather’s Invoices had been prepared in anticipation of the court hearing. [^38] In response to the Court’s queries about the unusual formality with which the Mother and the Grandfather conducted their family finances (i.e., by drawing up invoices and an IOU), the Mother’s counsel explained that the Mother had asked the Grandfather to “sign off” on these documents, in order for her to produce the evidential basis to support her claims.[^39] Given that the application was only filed in October 2019 and the monthly invoices were dated from August 2018 onwards, a reasonable inference was that the documents purportedly issued by the Grandfather were not contemporaneous evidence demonstrating actual expenses being incurred (as was suggested on the face of the monthly invoices), but rather was evidence produced as an afterthought to support the Mother’s case in court proceedings. Such an inference was also reinforced by other material discrepancies in the Mother’s documents on purported accommodation expenses, which I come to later in these grounds (see \[68\] below). Given that the Mother’s proposed figure of $650 for the use of the Grandfather’s car was based wholly on self-serving representations which were produced primarily to support the Mother’s claims in court proceedings, it could not be said that the claim was substantiated by any objective evidence.

46     As for the $250 claim in private-hire car (Grab)/taxi fares, it was not at all clear what proportion of taxi charges and “Grab” transactions was attributable to the children’s transport needs. The taxi fares ranged from about $10 to more than $20.[^40] The amounts for the “Grab” transactions varied even more widely, from as low as $1 to as high as $150.[^41] There was no explanation on how the proposed $250 figure was arrived at. For example, the Mother could have set out the approximate distance from their home to the children’s school and provided evidence of the average estimated transport fare on based on the travel distance, or highlighted recurrent transactions in her statements which were for the purpose of sending the Twins to and from school. Since there was no proper justification for the $250 figure, I was similarly unable to accept the Mother’s figure.

47     Given the state of the evidence before the Court, I accepted the Father’s position of $100 for the Twins’ transport expenses. There was simply very limited factual basis for me to arrive at a higher figure. Apart from the fact that the Twins’ school was located in the proximity of their residence, [^42] there was no _objective_ information presented to the Court to justify the transport expenses claimed (e.g. the approximate distance between the home and the school, whether the school was within walkable distance given its proximity, the actual petrol expenses (if any) that could be attributed to the children’s transport needs etc.). Indeed, if there were any objectively ascertainable facts on the costs incurred, I might have allowed a higher sum. But as I stated above, where the requisite facts were absent, it was not for the Court to fill the gaps of a party’s case based on its own conjecture or speculation.

48     In arriving at my determination, I also considered the fact that the Father owned a car and was willing to ferry the children around for school.[^43] This would allay some of the costs associated with the Twins’ transport needs.

49     All in all, since the Father accepted that an amount of $100 was justified for transport and there were no facts before me to indicate that the expenses incurred were more than that, I considered $100 to be an appropriate amount to be attributed to the children’s transport expenses.

(E)   Medical/dental

50     As for the children’s medical/dental expenses, I also accepted the Father’s position that $50/month was a reasonable sum. First, there was no evidence to suggest that the Twins had a chronic medical condition that required recurring or even frequent medical treatment. Second, although the Mother submitted documents on the hospitalisation fees and clinic charges for the children,[^44] the hospitalisation was an isolated incident and clinic charges were once- or twice-off payments. This reinforced the conclusion that the children’s medical needs were primarily of an ad hoc nature. Third, it was not disputed that the hospitalisation fees which were previously incurred had been fully covered by insurance (the premiums of which formed a separate claim in the table above). In other words, none of those hospitalisation fees had to be paid out-of-pocket. In the premises, there was insufficient evidence to support a recurring sum of $150/month proposed by the Mother for the children’s medical/dental expenses.

(F)   Toys/books

51     I accepted the Mother’s claim of $100 for toys/books. Under s 69(4)(_f_) of the Women’s Charter, the Court is required to consider the child’s standard of living. On the facts, I found that it was not unusual for the parties to spend about $100/month on these items for the Twins. The Father’s evidence was that he would also regularly buy toys and books for the Twins _in addition to_ a $50 budget for these expenses. There were times when he bought, for example, motorised bikes at $79.90[^45] and toy trains at about $120[^46] for the Twins. In the premises, I agreed with the Mother that $100 was a reasonable figure for this item.

(G)   Toiletries

52     I was unable to accept the Mother’s claim for $300/month in toiletries on the limited facts before the Court. Although the Mother submitted a large number of redacted bank statements and invoices from an online shopping platform to support her claim, the transactions which were attributable to the Twins’ financial needs were not at all clear from the pages submitted to the Court and a number of transactions (e.g. for false eyelashes, haircare and cosmetic products, etc.) were completely unrelated to the children’s needs. The bank statements were even more unclear. Given that the details and description of the transactions in the bank statements were redacted, I was unable to ascertain the purpose of the transactions and determine if they were in fact for the children’s needs. There was also no explanation as to how the figure of $300/month was derived. If the Mother asserted that the children’s expenses were $300/month, the burden was on her to prove her case with the necessary evidence and explanation — this was not done.

53     Since the Father accepted that a sum of $50/month was justified for the children’s toiletries and the Mother did not properly demonstrate to the Court why a higher amount should be allowed, I considered $50 to be an appropriate figure for this item.

(H)   Insurance

54     The Mother’s figure for insurance was also not substantiated by the evidence. The supporting document submitted simply showed that the total premiums for the Twins for four different insurance policies amounted to $907.52.[^47] There was no explanation, nor any other particulars provided, to show how the figure of $85/month for the Twins’ insurance was derived from the $907.52 amount.

55     On the facts, I allowed an amount of $75 for the children’s insurance. This was because a reasonable inference, that the $907.52 amount was for _annual_ insurance premiums, could be drawn. This would mean that the children’s monthly insurance premiums would be about $75.60 ($907.52 divided by 12 months). I therefore found that $75 (rounded off from $75.60) was a reasonable figure for this item.

(I)   The remaining undisputed items

56     As for the remaining items (diapers, ad hoc school-related expenses, vitamins/supplements, clothing/shoes/grooming), they were undisputed by the parties and I allowed them on the basis that the figures proposed were reasonably necessary for the children’s needs.

##### (2)   The Mother’s projected expenses

57     Apart from the current or actual expenses for the children, the Mother also included further claims under the label of “Projected Expenses”. As stated above at \[25\], case law states that the objective of s 69 applications is to provide “modest maintenance” to help the children overcome their “immediate financial need”. I did not consider it appropriate to take into account any of the items under “Projected Expenses”, as they fell outside the scope of this objective. I set out my reasons for each item below.

(A)   Children’s savings

58     The Mother did not provide any justification for why savings fell within the children’s “immediate financial need”. I therefore disallowed this claim.

(B)   Mobile

59     The Mother also asked for an amount of $55/month for mobile phone expenses, on the basis that it was essential for the Mother to contact the children’s school or for emergency needs.

60     The Father submitted that the mobile phone expenses should not be allowed, as this was an expense which the Mother would have incurred even if she did not have children.

61     I did not allow the Mother’s claim for mobile phone expenses. Having reviewed the Mother’s phone bills in support,[^48] I found that the Mother was seeking to attribute her monthly mobile subscription charges _in their entirety_ to the children’s needs. While I accepted that the Mother would have used her mobile phone for purposes associated with the children’s care, I was of the view that the Mother’s personal use of the mobile phone would be dominant and there was no reason for her to attribute the whole of her mobile expenses to the children. In addition, it was not suggested that the Mother was using her mobile phone for the children’s needs to such an extent that it justified at least a part of the total mobile phone bill to be attributed to their needs. I therefore found that this item was more appropriately characterised as the Mother’s personal expenses and declined to allow any part of it.

(C)   Shelter

62     I move on to the Mother’s request for “Shelter” or accommodation expenses at $3,200, which constituted the most significant component of the overall claim.

(I)    _The Mother’s position_

63     The Mother’s position was that shelter or accommodation expenses were reasonably necessary, as the Mother intended to find her own place to live with the Twins in District 15 (where the children were currently residing and where their routines had been established).[^49] Although the Twins were currently staying with the Mother at the Grandfather’s residence (a multi-storey bungalow),[^50] the Mother claimed that this was not an ideal arrangement as there were altogether ten people living together in the same property (including the Grandfather, the Mother’s siblings, and her sibling’s family).[^51]

64     To support the quantum of her claim, the Mother provided two sources of evidence. First, there were PropertyGuru listings on private apartments in District 15,[^52] which showed that the monthly rent for these apartments averaged at $3,277.[^53] Second, she relied on the Grandfather’s letter, IOU and the Grandfather’s Invoices setting out the costs of living for which she was purportedly being billed by the Grandfather (see above at \[41\]).[^54] According to the Grandfather’s Invoices, the Mother was being billed $3,200/month ($3,000/month for “Base Rent” and $200/month for utilities) for their stay at the Grandfather’s residence.[^55] The Grandfather’s letter to the Mother also expressed the Grandfather’s intention for the Mother to move out of his residence with the Twins.[^56]

(II)    _The Father’s position_

65     The Father’s position was that the claim for future accommodation should not be taken into account to meet the children’s “immediate financial need”. First, the Twins had the option of moving back into the matrimonial home. This was an offer which the Mother had not taken up. Second, the matrimonial home would soon be sold at the conclusion of divorce proceedings in the Syariah Court and the Mother would have more than sufficient funds to purchase her own property. Third, and in any event, the children were staying comfortably in the Grandfather’s multi-storey bungalow in the meantime.

66     The Father also disputed the authenticity of the Grandfather’s letter, the IOU and the Grandfather’s Invoices, on the basis that they were fabricated by the Mother in an attempt to inflate her maintenance claim (see above at \[43\]). The Father also highlighted that, if the proposed rental charges by the Grandfather were true and the Grandfather’s Invoices were supposedly available to her since August 2018, there was no reason for the Mother to have stated “$1,200” as rental in her Monthly Expenses Form which was submitted to the Court in December 2019.[^57] This was another fact which proved that the Mother’s documents were fabricated to support her grossly inflated claims for these proceedings.

(III)    _My findings_

67     I did not allow the Mother’s projected expenses for future accommodation or shelter, as I was not satisfied that they were reasonably necessary for the children’s “immediate financial need”. On the facts, there was alternative accommodation available to the Twins at the parties’ matrimonial home. It was not disputed that the Father had made a serious offer to move out of the matrimonial home in order for the Mother to move in with the Twins.[^58] There was also documentary evidence to show that the Mother was previously amenable to returning to the matrimonial home in as early as November 2018.[^59] The Mother’s reason for not moving into the matrimonial home now was essentially that the children’s school and routines have since been established in the Grandfather’s neighbourhood, and they should therefore continue to live in the same area.[^60] I did not agree with the Mother that it was reasonably necessary to incur an additional amount of $3,200 in accommodation expenses for this reason, and therefore disallowed this claim.

68     I then considered whether a reasonable amount should still be allowed for the Twins’ accommodation expenses at the Grandfather’s residence, but was unable to do so based on the limited facts before the Court. The only source of evidence before me on this item was the Grandfather’s Invoices, which stated that the Mother was being billed $3,000/month for “Base Rent” and $200/month for utilities. As I found above at \[45\], the Grandfather’s Invoices merely contained self-serving representations and were not supported by any objectively ascertainable facts (e.g. utility bills or similar). In this regard, I also accepted that it was counter-intuitive for the Mother to indicate rental as “$1,200” in her Monthly Expenses Form in December 2019 when she purportedly knew that she was being billed at least $3,000 for staying at the Grandfather’s residence since August 2018. Given that the Mother did not supply any alternative figures on the children’s share of the household expenses nor any evidence to demonstrate the real amounts, it was not possible for me to impute any reasonable figure to this item except by pure speculation and conjecture.

69     For the reasons above, I was unable to allow any part of the Mother’s claim for accommodation expenses.

(D)   Allowance/ad-hoc cash spending

70     The Mother also claimed $200 in “miscellaneous ad hoc expenses”, to repay the Grandfather for the Twins’ daily necessities.[^61] The Mother again relied on the Grandfather’s Invoices in support of this claim, under which she had purportedly been billed $200/month between August 2018 and July 2020 for “Additional Allowances for Ad-hoc Groceries, Food, Children’s Medication & Necessities (e.g. diapers, babywipes \[_sic_\], milk powder etc)”.

71     I did not allow the Mother’s claim as it involved double counting at various points. First, the Mother had already included expenses related to the Twins’ daily necessities (e.g. food (including groceries), medical expenses, diapers, toiletries and milk) under separate items of claim in the table above. Second, at the same time that the Mother was asking for _previous_ expenses from August 2018 to July 2020 to be included in the calculation of the Twin’s _current_ expenses, she was also asking that the final maintenance order be _backdated_ to August 2018.[^62] As this would result in a disproportionate and unduly inflated figure for the Twins’ expenses, I did not accept this claim.

(E)   Physical labour/domestic helper

72     I also did not allow the Mother’s claim of $1,000 for “Physical labour/Domestic helper”. There was no evidence that a domestic helper was in line with, or was required to maintain, the Twins’ standard of living. Notably, the parties had never hired a domestic helper.[^63] In addition, the children largely spent their time in childcare during the weekdays (from 7am to 7pm) and would spend the weekends with the Father.[^64] Outside of these times, the Mother’s family members were also available to help in the children’s care.[^65] I was therefore not satisfied that the expenses for hiring a domestic helper were reasonably necessary to meet the children’s “immediate financial need”.

(F)   Holidays/Recreational Activities/Staycations

73     I was unable to accept the Mother’s claim of $500/month for holidays and recreational activities as these expenses were not reasonably necessary to meet the children’s “immediate financial need”. Further, and in any event, there were no facts whatsoever to support this claim nor the quantum proposed. If the Mother asserted that the expense was reasonably necessary to meet the children’s “immediate financial need”, the burden was on her to prove her case with the necessary evidence and explanation — this was not done.

(G)   Excursions/Activities/Enrichments

74     For the same reasons in the preceding paragraph, I was unable to accept the Mother’s claim of $200/month for this item. It was not for the Court to fill the gaps of the Mother’s case based on its own conjecture or speculation, where no proper facts nor explanation was presented for the Court to ascertain the reasonable necessity of the claim.

75     All in all, I found that the Twins’ reasonable expenses amounted to $2,280/month (rounded off from $2,280.80/month). This was substantially lower than the $9,805/month which the Mother had sought.

#### The parties’ respective financial positions

76     Another key aspect in determining the amount of reasonable maintenance is the parties’ respective financial positions. In this regard, it was pertinent to consider not only the parties’ income/earning capacity but also their liabilities and expenses, which would provide a more holistic account of their respective financial positions.

##### (1)   The parties’ income/earning capacity

(A)   The Mother’s income/earning capacity

77     At the time of the hearing, the Mother was working as a community manager at a real estate company. I considered that it was appropriate to take into account the Mother’s monthly take-home salary of $2,785/month instead of her gross salary of $3,500/month, as it more accurately reflected the amount of disposable funds.[^66]

(B)   The Father’s income/earning capacity

78     The Mother’s position was that the Court should take into account the Father’s take-home salary at the time of the hearing, which was $15,000/month. The Father had been working at a major law firm in Singapore and was promoted to Partner in January 2020.[^67]

79     The Father, however, submitted that the correct figure should be $12,585/month. This was because his firm was implementing a 12.5% pay cut, such that his income would be reduced to about $13,125.[^68] In addition, as he was a partner in the law firm, his employers did not contribute to his Central Provident Fund (CPF) account and he was required to make his own annual Medisave contribution.[^69] According to the Father, his CPF contribution worked out to an average of $540/month.[^70] Altogether, this meant that his actual disposable income was more accurately reflected as $12,585/month.

80     I found that the appropriate figure to be taken into account was $15,000/month. This was because the Father was unable to confirm the effective date of the pay cut at the time of the hearing and was unable to provide documentary evidence on the same. I therefore took the Father’s income level at the time of the hearing. As for the Father’s CPF contribution, it was more appropriately characterised as a monthly liability (which I factor into my assessment below).

##### (2)   The parties’ liabilities and expenses

(I)    _The Father’s monthly loan repayments_

84     I accepted that the Father was incurring a monthly liability of $2,181.27 under the 4-year Debt Consolidation Plan. Although the Mother argued that the Father should re-finance his loan in order to lower his monthly repayments and avail more funds for the Twins,[^75] I found that this position was speculative as there was no objective evidence before the Court to prove that this was an option which the Father was eligible to exercise. The Mother also did not dispute that the Father was incurring this liability. I therefore saw no reason to make any adjustments to this figure.

85     I also accepted the Father’s other monthly loan repayments. The Mother similarly did not put forward any clear basis to dispute the loan amounts (including whether, and to what extent, the amounts should be adjusted). In fact, the Mother herself acknowledged that the Father had been in substantial debt since his university days and up until the present day.[^76] Since the Father’s monthly loan repayments appeared to be fixed liabilities owed and there were no facts to suggest otherwise, I did not see any reason to adjust the figures.

(II)    _The Father’s monthly expenses_

86     Similarly, I did not see any reason to revise the figures for the Father’s monthly expenses (except for “Biscuits/snacks (for children)” as they were already factored into the Twins’ reasonable expenses). I did not find that the Father’s monthly expenses were excessive, and the Mother did not provide any clear basis to show whether, and to what extent, the amounts should be adjusted.

(III)    _The Father’s other monthly liabilities_

##### (a)   Car lease

87     The Mother’s position was that the Father’s car lease (for a Mercedes Benz) was an unnecessary expense.[^77] Although she accepted that a car was a necessary mode of transport for the Twins, she suggested that there were cheaper lease options than the $2,095/month outlay for a Mercedes Benz.[^78]

88     The Father’s position was that the car lease was a reasonable expenditure. First, he needed his own car affixed with child safety seats to ferry the young children around safely.[^79] Second, it was not feasible for him to terminate the lease agreement at this juncture as he would incur $36,000 in early termination fees.[^80] Third, it could not be said that the car lease was extravagant nor excessive. The Father highlighted that the Mother’s own position indicated that a lease at $1,600/month for a Japanese car was reasonable.[^81] This was the figure which the Mother had originally relied upon to justify the Twins’ transport expenses.[^82] In comparison with the Father’s $2,095/month car lease, there was only a difference of about $400/month. [^83]

89     I found that a reasonable figure for the Father’s car lease should be $1,600/month. Both parties did not dispute the necessity of a car, and this was a figure which the Mother herself appeared to accept as reasonable. I also did not accept the Father’s position that it was not feasible to terminate the lease agreement at this stage on account of a $36,000 penalty. This position was not stated on affidavit (only in submissions) and there was no objective evidence was provided to substantiate this assertion. In the premises, I revised the $2,095/month figure downwards to $1,600/month for the Father’s car lease, which I found to be a reasonable expense on the facts.

##### (b)   Allowance for the Father’s parents and handicapped brother

90     The Father’s position was that he was contributing a sum of $800/month to his elderly parents who were no longer working.[^84] This included a sum of $200/month for them to support his handicapped brother.[^85]

91     The Mother disputed that the Father was giving his parents any money. According to the Mother, she was not aware of such an arrangement throughout the parties’ marriage and the Father had five other siblings who would also support his parents and handicapped brother financially.[^86] She therefore argued that this was the Father’s attempt to inflate his personal expenses and reduce his disposable funds.[^87]

92     I did not accept that the Father was incurring this expenditure. Apart from the Father’s bare assertion, there was no other evidence to show that this formed part of his regular monthly expenses.

##### (c)   The remaining items

93     Similar to the approach that I took for the Mother’s savings, I excluded the Father’s Unit Trust (Regular Savings Plan) from my assessment of his financial position. I did not consider savings to be an “expense” or “liability”.

94     As for the rest of the items, I did not make any adjustments as parties did not dispute that the Father was incurring these liabilities.

##### (3)   Summary of findings on the parties’ respective financial positions

95     My findings on the appropriate figures to be taken into account in assessing the parties’ respective financial positions were therefore as follows:

> (a)     The Father’s income was $15,000/month and his liabilities and expenses were $12,470/month.

> (b)     The Mother’s income was $2,785/month and her liabilities and expenses were $1,450/month.

#### Other relevant circumstances: the Deed of Reconciliation

96     Another key aspect of the Mother’s case related to a draft agreement between the parties known as the “Deed of Reconciliation”.[^88] The Deed of Reconciliation was drawn up in 2018 on a without prejudice basis in the course of earlier maintenance proceedings, which the Mother subsequently withdrew pursuant to the alleged agreement.[^89] Among other things, the Deed of Reconciliation set out the Father’s purported agreement to a maintenance amount of at least $3,900/month.

##### (1)   The Mother’s position

97     The Mother’s arguments on the Deed of Reconciliation were twofold. First, the fact that the Father agreed in 2018 to provide “a minimum of $3,900”[^90] every month indicated that he was willing and able to afford that sum. Second, it was only right for the Father to make good his promise to provide that amount because the Mother had withdrawn the earlier maintenance proceedings on the basis of that agreement.

##### (2)   The Father’s position

98     The Father’s position was that the Deed of Reconciliation should not prejudice him in any manner. First, the Deed of Reconciliation was a _draft_ agreement exchanged on a without prejudice basis.[^91] Second, the Deed of Reconciliation was eventually not signed by parties.[^92] Third, it was not true that the Father offered to pay a sum of $3,900/month for the Twins. The terms clearly stated that the $3,900/month was also for the Mother’s expenses.[^93] In fact, his $3,900/month offer was based on a breakdown of $1,500/month for the Twins, $1,500/month for the Mother and $900/month for the parties’ renovation loan.[^94] Fourth, the Deed of Reconciliation was not indicative of his actual ability to afford $3,900/month at the time. The Deed of Reconciliation was drafted in a desperate attempt to reconcile with the Mother, and the amount of $3,900/month was put up even though he knew it was not within his financial means.[^95]

##### (3)   My findings

(A)   Whether there was waiver of privilege

99     Although the Deed of Reconciliation was exchanged in the course of without prejudice negotiations for the purpose of settlement, I found that the parties had waived privilege in this case. This was because both parties had referred to the details of the Deed of Reconciliation to support their respective cases on whether an agreement was reached and on what terms. The Deed of Reconciliation was therefore no longer protected by privilege for the purpose of the present proceedings.

(B)   The effect of the Deed of Reconciliation

100    Nevertheless, I did not consider that it was appropriate to place any weight on the Deed of Reconciliation and its terms in determining what reasonable maintenance was in this case, as it was not at all clear that there was a valid agreement between the parties. On the facts, the document was not signed and neither party eventually followed through on their respective obligations under the Deed of Reconciliation.[^96] It therefore could not be said that the Deed of Reconciliation should be a determinative factor in the Court’s assessment.

#### Analysis: determining the amount of “reasonable maintenance” to be paid by the Father

101    To summarise my findings above:

> (a)     The Twins’ reasonable expenses amounted to $2,280/month.

> (b)     The Father’s income was $15,000/month and his expenses and liabilities were $12,470/month, whereas the Mother’s income was $2,785/month and her monthly expenses and liabilities were $1,450/month.

> (c)     It was not appropriate to place any weight on the terms of the Deed of Reconciliation in determining the amount of “reasonable maintenance” for the Twins.

102    Having regard to all the circumstances above, I determined that it was fair for the Twins’ reasonable expenses of $2,280/month to be apportioned between the Mother and the Father based on the ratio of their disposable funds:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="42.12%"> <col width="28.82%"> <col width="29.06%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b><em>Mother</em></b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b><em>Father</em></b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Monthly income</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$2,785</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$15,000</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Monthly liabilities and expenses</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$1,450</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$12,470</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Disposable funds</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$1,335</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$2,530</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Ratio of disposable funds (rounded off)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">35%</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">65%</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

103    This would translate into the Father paying a sum of $1,500/month (rounded off from $1,482/month, which was 65% of $2,280/month) for the Twins, which I found to be “reasonable maintenance” on the facts.

### Was there neglect or refusal to provide reasonable maintenance by the Father?

104    Having determined the quantum of reasonable maintenance at $1,500/month, the next step was to consider whether the Father had reasonably provided such maintenance.

#### The Mother’s position

105    The Mother’s case was that the Father had not provided reasonable maintenance from May 2019 onwards.[^97]

106    First, although the Father had offered to pay $3,900/month under the Deed of Reconciliation, the sums of money which he transferred to her in the following months fell short of this amount. Notably, there was a period of time between July 2019 and November 2019 during which the Father had paid nothing at all. The Mother set out the timeline of payments made by the Father and her position on the amount of shortfall in the following table:[^98]

107    Second, although the Mother did not dispute the fact that the Father continued to purchase essentials for the children between July 2019 and November 2019 (when no monies were being transferred), her position was that the purchases were insufficient.[^99]

108    Third, the Mother submitted that the additional $500 sums which the Father transferred for the Twins in June 2020 and August 2020 during birthday months should not be considered maintenance, as they were gifts.

109    Fourth, the Mother disputed the Father’s position that Baby Bonuses which were transferred to her should be considered in determining whether he had reasonably provided maintenance. This was because Baby Bonuses should not replace the Father’s contributions and legal obligations in maintaining his children.

110    Fifth, the Mother highlighted that the Father only started paying an amount of $1,500/month from December 2019 because he was ordered to do so by the Court.[^100]

#### The Father’s position

111    The Father’s case was that he had reasonably provided maintenance for the Twins from the time they were born. The Father referred to the High Court decision of _UHA v UHB_ to argue that “reasonableness” was not restricted to the quantum of monies provided and may be considered in several ways. In this regard, the Court can consider whether the paying party used a _reasonable mode_ of providing maintenance. On that basis, the Father submitted that the reasonableness requirement was satisfied when the broader context of the provision of maintenance (including the total quantum of payments, the purchase of daily essentials, the additional monetary gifts and the Baby Bonuses) was considered.[^101]

112    First, based on the timeline of payments set out by the Mother (which the Father did not dispute), the Father would have provided a total sum of $29,200 over the course of 21 months. This worked out to about $1,390/month.

113    Second, the $1,390/month did not include the costs of daily essentials which the Father continued to purchase for the Twins (e.g. milk powder, diapers, wet wipes, and toys) between July 2019 and November 2019.[^102]

114    Third, there was no reason why the additional sums of $500, which the Father transferred for the Twins during birthday months, should not be considered maintenance.[^103] These were monies which the Father had transferred to the Mother for the children’s needs.

115    Fourth, it was relevant to consider the Baby Bonuses which were transferred to the Mother, since the whole purpose of these government pay-outs was to alleviate the parents’ burden in maintaining their children.[^104] In this case, a total of $13,000 in Baby Bonuses was transferred to the Mother between December 2018 and December 2019.[^105] When the Baby Bonuses were factored into the calculations, the Mother had in fact received $42,200 (consisting of $29,200 from the Father and $13,000 from Baby Bonuses) over the course of 21 months. This translated into an average of about $2,010/month, which was being paid to the Mother to meet the Twins’ financial needs.

116    Fifth, the Father was always prepared to provide maintenance for the Twins voluntarily and without any court intervention.[^106] The Father had willingly and readily offered to pay $1,500/month at the court mention and had similarly proposed that he continue these payments at a subsequent court mention.[^107] In fact, he was unaware that an interim order on his proposed maintenance sum had been granted at the court mention and he nevertheless continued to make the monthly payments as proposed.[^108] To ensure that the Mother would be receiving maintenance promptly, he would also be making a standing instruction for the sum to be transferred to the Mother’s account automatically every month.[^109]

117    In the premises, the Father argued that there were no grounds to say that he was a neglectful parent and to justify a maintenance order against him.

#### The applicable principles

##### (1)   A contextual analysis

118    The relevant principles in determining whether a parent reasonably provided maintenance are set out in _UHA v UHB_ (see above at \[24\]).

119    Drawing on the principles laid down in _UHA v UHB_, it was appropriate for the Court to base its assessment on a holistic consideration of the parent’s conduct _within its context_. This was the legal position which was espoused by the Father in reliance on _UHA v UHB_, and which was not disputed by the Mother.[^110] It was also consistent with the directive under s 69(4) of the Women’s Charter to take into account all the relevant circumstances of the case in making a maintenance order. On this approach, factors such as the parent’s mode of provision and the circumstances surrounding the provision of maintenance must also feed into the analysis.

##### (2)   The treatment of Baby Bonuses

120    On the question of how the availability of Baby Bonuses should be treated, I was of the view that this was a qualitative (rather than a quantitative) factor that may be taken into account as part of the _circumstances_ in which the reasonableness of a parent’s conduct ought to be assessed. Although Baby Bonuses are ostensibly of a quantitative nature (in that they are of a measurable quantity), there were at least two difficulties with adopting a purely quantitative approach:

> (a)     First, it was difficult to determine, with precision, how the amounts should affect the proportion of maintenance payments to be made over time.

> (b)     Second, even if it were possible to do so, it posed problems from a policy perspective. To say that the amount of reasonable maintenance payable by either parent may be set off by the relevant proportion of Baby Bonuses would send a wrong signal that a parent’s legal duty to maintain their child may be relieved, or substituted by, government pay-outs and subsidies.

121    It was therefore more appropriate to consider the availability of Baby Bonuses _qualitatively_, in that the it would help to _cushion a parent’s financial contributions at the material time_. Such a qualitative approach to factors of a quantitative nature is broadly similar to the way in which other factors under s 69(4) of the Women’s Charter have been taken into account by the courts, such as a parent’s savings/financial resources. Therefore, in determining whether a parent has reasonably provided maintenance, the court may consider the availability of Baby Bonuses as part of the _circumstances_ in which that parent’s conduct is being assessed.

#### My findings

122    On the facts, I found that the Mother did not satisfy her burden of proof in establishing that the Father had refused or neglected to provide reasonable maintenance.

123    First, on a holistic consideration of the timeframe presented to the Court, it was not disputed that the Father had provided a total sum of $29,200 for the children over the course of 21 months. This translated to about $1,390/month.

124    Second, it was not disputed that the Father also purchased daily essentials for the children between July 2019 and November 2019. Although the Mother contended that the purchases were insufficient, the burden of proof was on the Mother to bring the evidence before the Court. As this was not done, I was unable to accept her bare assertion.

125    Third, it was appropriate to consider the additional sums of $500 which the Father transferred during birthday months as maintenance for the Twins. It was not disputed that the sums were for the children, and the Mother did not provide any clear explanation as to why the amounts should not be considered maintenance.

126    Fourth, there were Baby Bonuses available to cushion the Father’s financial contributions at the time. It was not disputed that $13,000 in Baby Bonuses was transferred to the Mother around this period.

127    Fifth, I accepted that the Father was making the payments of $1,500/month from December 2019 onwards _voluntarily_, and not because there was a court order requiring him to do so. It was apparent from the facts that the Father had been completely unaware that a court order requiring him to make payments of $1,500/month for the children existed,[^111] until it was disclosed in the Notes of Evidence after the hearing before me. He nevertheless continued to make those payments dutifully every month. Furthermore, it was clear from the Notes of Evidence that it was the Father who had proposed a payment of $1,500/month for the Twins at the court mention.[^112] In addition, to ensure that the Mother would receive the monthly maintenance regularly and on time, he had committed to making a standing instruction for the sum to be transferred to the Mother’s account automatically every month. It therefore could not be said that the Father started to make the regular payments of $1,500/month only because he was ordered by the Court to do so, nor that the Father refused to provide maintenance for his children.

128    Drawing together the threads of the analysis above, there was insufficient proof to conclude that the Father had neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance. As stated above, despite the Mother’s constant refrain that the Father should be held to the $3,900/month payments under the parties’ Deed of Reconciliation, I determined that reasonable maintenance in this case was $1,500/month. I proceeded to adopt a practical approach as set out in _UHA v UHB_ (at \[45\]), in assessing whether the Father had reasonably provided such maintenance. On a holistic consideration of the Father’s mode of provision and the circumstances in which maintenance was being provided, the facts showed that:

> (a)     the Father was transferring an average of $1,390/month in cash to the Mother;

> (b)     in addition to the cash payments, the Father continued to purchase daily essentials for the children for a number of months;

> (c)     Baby Bonuses of $13,000 was available at the time to help cushion the Father’s financial contributions; and

> (d)     the Father had _voluntarily_ been making payments of $1,500/month from December 2019 onwards for the Twins and would _continue_ to do so under a standing instruction to his bank.

129    In the circumstances, I found that the Mother failed to show due proof that the Father had neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the Twins. The legal requirement in s 69(2) for the Court to grant a maintenance order was therefore not met.

### Whether maintenance should be backdated and whether an attachment of earnings order should be made

130    Since there was no basis to grant a maintenance order in this case, it was not necessary for me to consider whether maintenance should be backdated or whether an attachment of earnings order should be made.

## Conclusion

131    In summary, I made the following findings:

> (a)     The children’s reasonable expenses amounted to $2,280/month.

> (b)     The Father’s income was $15,000/month and his liabilities and expenses were $12,470/month. The Father therefore had $2,530/month in disposable funds.

> (c)     The Mother’s income was $2,785/month and her liabilities and expenses were $1,450/month. The Mother therefore had $1,335/month in disposable funds.

> (d)     It was fair for the Twins’ reasonable expenses of $2,280/month to be apportioned between the Mother and the Father in a 35:65 ratio, based on the ratio of their disposable funds.

> (e)     The amount of reasonable maintenance to be paid by the Father was therefore $1,500/month (rounded off from $1,482/month, which was 65% of $2,280/month).

> (f)     On the facts, such maintenance was reasonably provided by the Father.

> (g)     As such, there was no basis to make a maintenance order against the Father.

> (h)     It was therefore not necessary for me to consider whether maintenance should be backdated or whether an attachment of earnings order should be made.

132    I therefore dismissed the Mother’s application in its entirety.

## Costs

133    The Father’s position on costs was that it should be awarded on an indemnity basis, at $13,003.42 (inclusive of disbursements).[^113] First, the Father’s counsel informed the Court that the Father had made an offer to settle in June 2020, under which he had offered to pay a sum which was higher than what the Court found to be reasonable maintenance in this case. This was not accepted by the Mother. Second, the Father highlighted that the Mother had conducted her case unreasonably and had prosecuted a number of frivolous and highly inflated claims. Third, there was also substantial preparatory work done, in the form of three rounds of affidavits, submissions to the Court, and multiple court attendances.

134    The Mother’s position was that no costs order should be made. This was because the Mother had been compelled to take out the present application in October 2019, after the Father had failed to transfer monies for the children’s expenses regularly between July 2019 and November 2019. The Mother’s counsel also highlighted that the substantive hearing of the application was only half a day.

135    Having considered both counsel’s submissions, I fixed costs at $8,000 (all in) payable by the Mother to the Father. First, it was not disputed that the Mother had rejected an offer to settle in June 2020 which was more favourable than the judgment. Since the first round of affidavits were exchanged in July 2020, the Mother’s acceptance of the offer to settle in June 2020 would have terminated the litigation at an early stage and saved the parties time and costs. Second, the Mother had prosecuted a number of highly inflated claims which had little basis in law or evidence, which unreasonably added to the complexity of the case. This included claims of about $5,000 in projected expenses such as $3,200 in future accommodation expenses and $1,000 in domestic helper charges which was not borne out on the facts. The Mother also sought to attribute her mobile phone expenses in their entirety to the children’s needs where there was no basis to do so. Third, there was some questionable conduct on the Mother’s part in creating documentary evidence to substantiate some of her inflated claims. In the premises, I was of the view that the costs should reflect the manner in which the Mother had conducted her case in addition to the amount of work done, and made my order accordingly.
