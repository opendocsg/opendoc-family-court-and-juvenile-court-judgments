Vulnerable Adults – Abuse – Neglect – Necessary for Protection and Safety

13 February 2020

### District Judge Lim Keng Yeow:

### Introduction

1       This was the first contested Vulnerable Adults Act 2018[^1] (“VAA”) case to be dealt with at the Family Justice Courts.

2       The VAA was passed by Parliament on 18 May 2018 and came into operation on 19 December 2018. Aimed at the safeguarding of vulnerable adults from abuse, neglect or self-neglect, the Act provides for two main categories of court orders:

> (a)     Orders sought by the State concerning the placement, supervision or safety of a vulnerable adult[^2], and

> (b)     Orders sought against a respondent, either by a private individual or by the State, for the protection of a vulnerable adult[^3].

3       This case involves an application for the latter type of orders. The parties are siblings. The Applicant sought orders under Section 14(1)(e) to (h) VAA[^4] against the his elder brother (“the Respondent”), for the protection of their elderly mother. The orders sought were as follows:

> (a)     Section 14(1)(e) Restraining Order;

> (b)     Section 14(1)(f) Exclusion Order;

> (c)     Section 14(1)(g) Non-access Order, and

> (d)     Section 14(1)(h) Non-visitation / Non-communication Order.

4       The trial for this application was heard before me on 21 November 2019. I delivered my decision on 9 December 2019, making two protection orders against the Respondent. There was no appeal against my decision.

### A “Vulnerable Adult”

5       Before any order can be made under the VAA, the person to be protected must first be shown to be a “vulnerable adult”. The VAA defines a “vulnerable adult” as an individual 18 years and above, who is “by reason of mental or physical infirmity, disability or incapacity, incapable of protecting himself or herself from abuse, neglect or self-neglect”[^5].

6       I noted the Mental Capacity Assessment Form (“MCAR”) submitted by the Applicant in relation to the parties’ mother. The signatories of the Form indicated the diagnosis of “Severe mixed vascular and Alzheimer’s dementia”, and certified that the mother would have _no_ mental capacity to give consent to the court interventions sought by the Applicant[^6].

7       I also considered the Tan Tock Seng Hospital’s (“TTSH”) medical report dated 17 June 2019, which stated that the mother was “not orientated to time, place and person, and unable to tell her address nor whom she stays with” and that she “lacked mental capacity in relation to personal welfare and self care”.

8       Both documents did show that, as a result of her mental state, the parties’ mother would be unable to protect herself from any abuse or neglect. No contrary evidence was presented by the Respondent, Hence, I accepted that she was a “vulnerable adult” as defined in the VAA (I refer to her as “the VA” henceforth).

9       For completeness, I add that the VA was already over 90 years ago, has been chair to bed-bound since 2014, and has for some time been dependent on caregivers for her activities of daily living and suffered from numerous other physical ailments[^7].

### The Requirements for Section 14(1) orders

10     Under Section 12 read with Section 14(1), the Applicant had to establish the following two requirements before any order under Section 14 could be granted:

> (a)     The VA has experienced, or is experiencing or at risk of, abuse, neglect or self-neglect; and

> (b)     The orders are necessary for the protection and safety of the VA.

In relation to the making of an order under Section 14(1)(e), it is specifically _abuse_ that is relevant, not neglect (or self-neglect, obviously). Either abuse or neglect can be the basis for orders under Sections 14(1)(f) to (h).

### Whether the First Requirement was satisfied

11     Concerning the first requirement, the Applicant’s allegations related to both abuse and neglect. Under Section 12, it is not necessary for an applicant to show that abuse or neglect is still occurring, or even that abuse or neglect has ever occurred. The first requirement is met even if it is only shown that the VA is _at risk of_ abuse or neglect (whether or not abuse and/or neglect has actually occurred, however, may be relevant when the second requirement is considered).

12     “Abuse” is defined broadly in the VAA[^8]. Apart from physical, emotional or psychological abuse, it includes “conduct or behaviour by an individual that unreasonably deprives, or threatens to unreasonably deprive, another individual of that other individual’s liberty of movement or wellbeing”. The final word, “wellbeing”, is also broadly defined. It is important to note that no bad faith needs to be established. A person’s actions may amount to “abuse” even where he has acted _without_ any ill intent. What is more important is the reasonableness of the person’s actions.

13     The same is true for “neglect”. It is defined as “the lack of provision to the individual of essential care (such as but not limited to food, clothing, medical aid, lodging and other necessities of life), to the extent of causing or being reasonably likely to cause personal injury or physical pain to, or injury to the mental or physical health of, the individual”. Again, neglect may be found to have occurred even where one has acted without untoward intentions.

14     I turn now to consider whether the first requirement was satisfied in this case as regards the VA. At all material times, the Respondent lived with the VA together with the current foreign domestic worker (“the maid”) hired to care for the VA. It was not disputed that: a) the Respondent would give the maid instructions on the care of the VA, and fully expected his instructions to be complied with, and b) both the Respondent and the Applicant had a very strife-ridden relationship and the Applicant would not go to the VA’s home when the Respondent was present there.

### Applying his own remedies and preventing the use of prescribed medication

15     The Applicant testified that the VA was at risk of skin rashes and bedsores, especially at her buttocks. This was apparently because she had to wear disposable diapers and was bed/chair-bound. His evidence was that the Respondent had insisted that the maid applied fish oil, cooking oil, sesame oil on the VA instead of the medically-prescribed cream for the skin.

16     When the maid resisted this and tried to use the prescribed medication, the Respondent went to the point of locking away the prescribed medication to prevent their use and required the maid to apply his methods in front of him to ensure that his instructions were complied with. As a result, the VA suffered physically. On 20 May 2019, the Applicant had to step in to convey the VA to TTSH. On that occasion, the hospital warded the VA for treatment.

17     The Respondent did not dispute the allegations. Instead, he sought to justify his actions, claiming that:

> (a)     A brother-in-law’s mother who had earlier suffered from bedsores had passed away despite use of medically-prescribed medication, and that showed that those measures would not be as effective as his own methods, and

> (b)     Doctors and nurses saw that his methods brought improvement and approved of them.

18     The Respondent’s actions in this regard can only be described as quite bizarre. I was wholly unable to accept his evidence that his methods were approved of by medical professionals to the point of being sanctioned for use in place of the prescribed medication. Apart from these claims being unsubstantiated, what he asserted would also be clearly and completely inconsistent with the TTSH’s medical report dated 17 June 2019[^9]. Of course, the other assertion concerning the other relative provided absolutely no justification for his actions.

19     I accepted that the Respondent’s actions in this regard unreasonably deprived the VA of her wellbeing such as to amount to “abuse” as defined in the VAA. His act of preventing the use of prescribed medication and doggedly insisting on his own remedies also amounted to “neglect”. These findings alone would mean that the first requirement was satisfied.

### Confining the VA at home and to her bed

20     The Applicant also testified that the Respondent would lock the VA and the maid at home when he went out. According to the Applicant, this act of confining them was habitual. It occurred on many documented occasions, including the dates as shown in page 54 to 82 of his main set of documents (totalling some 22 occasions). The Applicant also alleged that the Respondent would sometimes not return home the same day after he had locked them in. This, he submitted, posed serious dangers in the event of a fire. It also prevented the maid from wheeling the VA downstairs for a change of environment and to interact with neighbours, something which was good for her wellbeing.

21     The Respondent did not dispute having done what was alleged. His explanation was that, when he was not around, he did not want the maid to go out so as to “mix around” with her friends. He also mentioned how the _previous_ maid had gone out at night on her own, and presumably did not want this to happen with the current maid. Furthermore, he saw no need for the maid to wheel the VA downstairs. He interpreted this as merely a ploy to allow the VA and/or the maid to meet the Applicant outside the home, contrary to the Respondent’s wishes.

22     I noted that the Respondent did not allege that the current maid would or did step out of the home _on her own_, abandoning the VA and endangering her wellbeing. Whatever he felt about the previous maid, there was no evidence of the current maid doing anything of this sort. From his testimony, I understood that what he really did not want, was the maid taking the opportunity to meet other people (including the Applicant) when she did wheel the VA out. There was no indication that his motivations had anything to do with the welfare of the VA.

23     Furthermore, the confinement was clearly not a one-off occurrence, and each time it happened, it was absolute and anything but brief. I found the Respondent’s repeated instances of depriving the VA of liberty of movement to be wholly unreasonable. The concern over what would happen in the event of a fire could not be lightly dismissed. In the circumstances, I concluded that this satisfied the definition of “abuse”.

24     A related allegation was that the Respondent would, on occasion, tie the VA’s hands to her bed, or require the maid to do so. Photographs showing the VA’s hands tied to her bed were tendered in support of this allegation. The Respondent did not deny having done or instructed this, but stated that this was necessary to facilitate the application of the oils, presumably because the VA reacted against this.

25     The Applicant countered that he had no need to do so when proper medication was applied on the VA during the times he was there. I accepted the allegation to be established and the act of tying the VA hands to her bed to also unreasonably deprive the VA of liberty of movement at those moments, and to amount to “abuse”.

### Other allegations

26     The Applicant’s other allegations concerned events that took place a longer time ago or were at least partly disputed by the Respondent. I decided that reliance on those allegations was not necessary. With my finding that “abuse” and “neglect” had been experienced by the VA, the first requirement was amply satisfied.

### Whether the Second Requirement was satisfied

27     I turn now to the second requirement: only orders which are “necessary for the protection and safety” of the VA may be made. I go through the orders sought by the Applicant to explain my conclusions in relation to each of them.

28     The first order sought by the Applicant was a restraining order under Section 14(1)(e). This is only applicable where the VA has experienced or is experiencing abuse or likely to be abused, and is the most basic protection order under the VAA. In light of the abuse that has occurred and the extent to which the risk remained, I had no difficulty in finding this order to be necessary.

29     The second order sought by the Applicant was an exclusion order under Section 14(1)(f). This order grants a vulnerable adult exclusive occupation of the place s/he resides in to the exclusion of an abuser or some other person. While this causes obvious inconvenience and even some hardship to a respondent who has been residing at the same place as the vulnerable adult, the VAA does not explicitly require the court to consider this or prescribe for the impact on the respondent to be weighed. The critical consideration in the provision is whether the order is “necessary for the protection and safety” of the vulnerable adult.

30     On the facts of this case, I took into account, _firstly_, the fact that apart from the Respondent, no other family member either lived or was then living with the VA and the maid in recent times. While the Applicant said that he went there daily (which I accepted), it was not disputed that he would not be there most of the time, and certainly not when the Respondent was home. He would not be able to prevent the carrying-out of the Respondent’s direct instructions when he was not there. The VA, in her present condition, would obviously be totally unable to give any instructions to the maid or protect herself from instructions that could harm her.

31     All that put the Respondent in a position of dominance and control. As long as he resided there, he would effectively be _the_ person determining how the VA would be cared for, since he alone would supervise the maid, give instructions concerning the care of the VA, and ensure that his instructions are in fact carried out.

32      _Secondly_, I found the personal characteristics of the Respondent to be relevant. He was someone who was very fixed in his views, and was apt to be aggressive in maintaining them. This meant that even if the Applicant or any other family member tried to, they would hardly be able to put a check on his methods, or even be free to express to him a different view concerning the VA’s care. This was asserted not only in the Applicant’s evidence. It was obvious from how the Respondent conducted himself in court.

33     The Respondent’s conduct as a litigant-in-person during the trial was most regrettable. He had difficulty abiding by basic aspects of trial procedure and repeatedly remonstrated over what was not to his liking. For instance, he was unhappy over how he could not speak in a combination of English and Mandarin, repeatedly insisting that both were official languages. When the Applicant was going through the allegations as a witness on the stand, the Respondent protested against getting to cross-examine him only at the end of his testimony, contending that this was unfair. He wanted the Applicant’s testimony to be broken up so that he could cross-examine him allegation by allegation as the Applicant was going through them.

34     He also persisted in harping on reasons for his disdain for the Applicant, most of which related to incidents long past and were of little relevance to these proceedings. Despite being directed by me to refocus on the allegations against him instead, he refused to let up on insults and personal attacks against him.

35     Impervious and resistant toward guidance or caution from me, his conduct tended to divert attention away from the issues, needlessly prolonged the hearing, and made it far more hostile and unpleasant than it had to be. Sadly, throughout the process, he seemed to have but a minimal level of self-awareness and insight over his own conduct.

36     If, even within the formal setting of a courtroom before me, this was how he would conduct himself, I could see how impossible it would be for the Applicant or any other family member (especially with their history of animosity) to reason with him, or to countermand his instructions and put in place a different set of instructions relating to the care of the VA. As long as he resided with the VA, he would see to it that it his will would be done. Given how his actions and methods have already caused harm to the VA, the continued exertion of his will could only further threaten the protection and safety of the VA.

37     Taking into account the above considerations, I found that an order excluding the Respondent from the VA’s residence would be necessary for her protection and safety.

38     For completeness, I make mention of a third consideration that could provide support for the making of this order[^10]. I noted that the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) has had to act upon allegations against the Respondent of abuse of the maid who at the time of the hearing had been looking after the VA. As a condition for having a maid and allowing this particular maid to remain employed to care for the VA, MOM had stipulated that the Applicant was to prevent the Respondent from having any contact with the maid.

39     The relevant MOM letters dated 31 May and 10 July 2019 were tendered and these facts were not disputed by the Respondent. The Respondent, in fact, openly made reference to how this came about. This related to the incident where he saw her at TTSH after the VA was taken there on 20 May 2019. He said was so filled with rage against the maid for allowing the Applicant access to the VA (resulting in the VA being taken to hospital) that he sought to abuse her physically.

40     Given these circumstances, if the Respondent were free to reside with the VA, there was every probability that MOM could no longer allow the maid (or _any_ maid, for that matter) to be employed to care for the VA. I accepted as true the indications that the current maid has been heavily relied on to care for the VA and has been providing (at least) reasonably sufficient care for the VA. I also accepted that she has been a protective figure over the VA. If she could not continue to reside with the VA, or if no maid could be employed to give attention to the VA, this would certainly affect the care and wellbeing of the VA.

41     This consideration has to be balanced against three important qualifiers.

42     Firstly, it must be remembered that this factor may relate more to the provision of _day-to-day care_ to the VA rather than to her _safety and protection_. It is the latter that the VAA is concerned about, not so much the former. Of course, I also accepted, given the dire condition of the VA and her need for close personal attention, that there was a significant measure of overlap between the two such that shortcomings in her day-to-day care would threaten her safety and protection.

43     Secondly, having a maid would not necessarily be the only way the VA could be cared for. Even if I were to accept that a preference for homecare was understandable, there was no evidence before me to show that, in the event that hiring a personal caregiver was not possible, other forms of care (such as placement in a nursing home) were not viable. Hence, the true extent to which the absence of a maid would necessarily jeopardise the safety and protection of the VA was unclear.

44     Thirdly, while MOM’s warnings are clear and severe, the consequence of not being allowed to employ a maid (if the Respondent continued to reside there) was still a contingent one and had not crystallised. I could not allow projected actions of such an agency to direct or fetter the exercise of judicial discretion. Furthermore, the conditions related only to the period of time then, where police investigations were still ongoing.

45     In light of the above, I saw this consideration as relevant but insufficient to warrant the exclusion of the Respondent from the VA’s residence. By virtue of the other considerations, however, I remained fully prepared to make an order under Section 14(1)(f).

46     The Applicant also sought a third and fourth order. These come under Sections 14(1)(g) to (h), and, if made, will prohibit the Respondent from being in the vicinity of where the VA resided and also prevent him from any form of visitation of the VA and having any communication with her.

47     I was of the view that these orders were not necessary for the protection and safety of the VA. On the evidence before me, these two additional orders would be wider than truly necessary for the protection and safety of the VA and were not required in order to prevent interference with the care of the VA, especially in light of how the other two orders would be in place to ensure her protection and safety.

48     I was fully cognisant of a particular practical outcome of not making these orders: the Respondent would not be prevented from having contact with the maid. The orders I made will go only as far as ensuring that such contact will be in public places rather than within the confines of the home, while it was indeed in a public place (a hospital) that the Respondent had attempted to abuse the maid. MOM may well take the position that the Applicant may not be allowed to continue to hire the maid to care for the VA as a result.

49     Despite recognising the above, I was not prepared to make orders that would result in the Respondent being fully prevented from ever seeing his mother, and saw no reason to tailor these orders to whatever position that MOM might choose to take. In my judgment, what was critical was that the Respondent was excluded from the VA’s residence and that her day-to-day care and safety were not jeopardised. As long as that was assured, I was not satisfied that it was necessary to prevent the Respondent from having any form of access to and communication with his mother.

### Conclusion

50     In the circumstances, I made only the following orders under Sections 14(1)(e) and (f):

> (a)     The Respondent shall be restrained from abusing or further abusing \[B\],

> (b)     The Respondent shall be excluded from the residence of \[B\] at _\[address redacted\]_, with effect from 9 December 2019.

I did not see the need for counselling orders, and no other ancillary orders were made.
