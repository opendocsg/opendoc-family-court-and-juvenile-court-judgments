Section 72 Women’s Charter (Cap 353) Variation of Maintenance Order for the Maintenance of Child

8 September 2020

### District Judge Jason Gabriel Chiang:

## I.   INTRODUCTION

1       This case centred on the issue of whether there has been a material change in circumstances to warrant an upward variation of a maintenance order for the biological child of parties (“**Child**”).

2       In MSS 1454/2020, the Complainant Mother (“**Mother**”) sought the variation of Maintenance Order, VO(MO) xxx/2018, seeking that the Respondent Father (“**Father**”) pays monthly child maintenance of S$750.00 instead of S$660.00 (i.e. an upward variation of S$90.00). Parties were litigants in person and consented to the trial being conducted over Zoom.

3       The matter was heard over a half-day trial on 23 July 2020 and at the conclusion, I held that the Mother had only discharged her burden of proving that there had been an increase in the Child’s school fees by S$100.00 and that this was a material change in circumstances warranting a variation of maintenance order. Given parties’ agreement that the expenses of the Child should be divided equally, I ordered, in VO(MO) 158/2020, that the monthly child maintenance be increased to S$710.00 (i.e. increase of S$50.00), to be paid on the 12th day of the month to the Mother’s bank account and that this supersedes VO(MO) xxx/2018.

4       On 30 July 2020, the Father, being dissatisfied with my decision, filed an Appeal against the Orders. The full grounds of my decision are set out below.

## II.   BACKGROUND FACTS

5       The Child, parties’ daughter, was born in November 2012 and, at the time of the hearing, was 7 years old. According to the Mother, the Child was attending Primary 2 in a local school. The Child would have begun Primary 1 at the start of 2019.

6       The Mother and Father were never married and had long since parted ways. The Father has a new family with 2 children aged 2 and a half years and 4 months respectively. The Father is a Singapore Permanent Resident. The Mother and the Child are foreigners from a non-ASEAN country, i.e. the People’s Republic of China, but residing in Singapore. The Mother holds an S-Pass and is working for a local company.

7       The Mother first sought maintenance for the Child by filing MSS xxx/2012 on 14 December 2012. An order for maintenance was made in MO xxx/2013. Subsequently, on 25 April 2015, the Mother filed MSS xxx/2015, seeking an upward variation in maintenance. A consent order was recorded on 6 May 2015, that the Father would pay S$600.00 to the Mother for the Child’s monthly maintenance on the 12th day of every month. About 3 years later, the Mother sought an upward variation in child maintenance in MSS xxx/2018 filed on 7 April 2018. By consent, VO(MO) xxx/2018 was ordered on 23 April 2018, varying the Child’s monthly maintenance to S$660.00. Just over 2 years later, the Mother filed this current application, MSS 1454/2020.

## III.   THE ISSUE TO BE DETERMINED

8       The sole issue to be determined in this case was whether the Mother had discharged her burden to evidence a material change in circumstances warranting an upward variation in maintenance.

### A.   The Law

9       Pursuant to section 72 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353) (“**Women’s Charter**”), the Court may, on the application and proof of a change in circumstances of that person or the child, or for other good cause being shown to the satisfaction of the court, order that a maintenance order be rescinded or varied as the court thinks fit.

10     Section 73 of the Women’s Charter further provides that any agreement relating to maintenance for a child may be varied where the court is “_satisfied that it is reasonable and for the welfare of the child to do so_”. In the Court of Appeal case of **_AYM v AYL_** **<span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 559</span>** at \[16\], it was further held that this provision is wife enough to encompass a material change in the circumstances of the parents as a basis for varying the maintenance for the child.

11     In the present case, the Mother, who had applied for the variation of the maintenance order for the Child must show that there was a material change in circumstances to justify a variation of the current maintenance order on the child. This can be substantiated in a myriad of ways, for example: evidencing a substantial drop in her income or increase in the Child’s expenses.

### B.   Application of the Law to the Facts

12     While the Father provided significant supporting documentation, the Mother provided little to support her claims. Parties were asked to confirm whether they wanted to seek the leave of Court to submit further documents at the start of the trial, but both confirmed that they did not have any further documents to submit.

13     In support of her application, the Mother claimed to still be working in the same job that she was working in when the prior order was made, but due to the measures adopted by the company to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic and its effect on their business, her income was reduced by 40 to 50%. The Mother also alleged that as she was only working in Singapore under an S-Pass linked to her current employment and that she was unable to take on any part-time jobs to develop other sources of income. However, other than the Mother’s assertions, the Mother failed to provide documentary evidence that her monthly income of S$3,500.00 had decreased.

14     The Mother further claimed that the Child’s expenses had increased since the last order. Namely, the costs of room rental, transport, food and groceries, clothing, library membership fee, medical and dental expenses as well as education costs were either new expenses or had increased. However, save for a few recent receipts for groceries, toiletries, books and stationary supplies and clothing items, the Mother did not have any further supporting documents for such expenses, let alone, to show an increase in such expenditure. Moreover, with regard to room rental, the Mother alleged that this had increased from S$800.00 to S$880.00 since the last order, however, she claimed that this was paid in cash by hand. There was purportedly no written agreement or tenancy agreement for this room rental. No bank statements were provided to reflect any alleged increase in expenditure.

15     With regard to the increase in the Child’s education costs, the Mother claimed that she did not keep receipts for school fees. However, she alleged that as a non-ASEAN foreigner, the Child was subject to higher school fees, which were provided on the Ministry of Education’s (“**MOE’s**”) website.

16     In this regard, during the Father’s cross-examination of the Mother, the Father referred to a Straits Times article (the “**Article**”) on persons having to pay more for the next 3 years for primary school fees. Leave was granted for the Father to admit a screenshot of this article into evidence. According to the Article, the monthly primary school fees for international students not from ASEAN countries had been increasing, i.e. from S$600.00 in 2017, to S$650.00 in 2018, to S$700.00 in 2019 and S$750.00 in 2020. Leave was also granted to the Mother to admit a screenshot of MOE’s website showing that the monthly primary school fees for non-ASEAN international student, as well as a monthly S$13.00 miscellaneous fee had increased from S$663.00 in 2018, to S$713.00 in 2019 to S$763.00 in 2020. In any event, both pieces of evidence showed there was an increase of S$100.00 in the monthly school fees for a non-ASEAN international student between 2018 and 2020.

17     It was undisputed that in 2018, when the last maintenance order was made by consent, it was on the basis that the Child was in kindergarten and was about to enter primary school in Singapore. Hence, there were increased expenses for the Child for the monthly primary school fees for a non-ASEAN international student. The Mother purported that at that point in time when the last order was made in May 2018, she had relied on MOE’s declared monthly school and miscellaneous fees of S$663.00 for a non-ASEAN international student for the Child’s primary school admission in 2019. As such, any increase in the Child’s education expenses would not be a jump from a monthly sum of S$0 to S$763.00, but instead a S$100.00 increase from S$663.00 to S$763.00.

18     Parties were also in agreement that the proportionate sharing for the Child’s reasonable expenses was equal sharing.

19     In the circumstances, I found that while the Mother had failed to discharge her evidentiary burden on showing an increase in the Child’s expenses in other aspects, she had sufficiently evidenced that there was a S$100.00 increase in the Child’s monthly primary school fees as the Child was an international student from a Non-ASEAN Country, i.e. the People’s Republic of China. On the basis that parties were equally sharing the Child’s maintenance at S$660.00 per parent (i.e. an aggregate of S$1,320.00), a S$100.00 change in expenses would amount to an 7 to 8% increase in expenses, which I found to be a material change in circumstances. It further goes without saying that the Child obtaining an education at a local public school is in the welfare of the Child and is reasonable. Given the agreement on equal sharing, even though the Father was earning significantly more than the Mother, I ordered that the increase of S$100.00 in education expenses be shared equally between the Mother and the Father and increased the monthly maintenance sum from S$660.00 to S$710.00.

20     The Father argued that given that the Mother’s job was no longer as stable, in light of the Covid-19 situation, that the Mother and Child should relocate back to China, where the costs of living would be lower and she could reside in China at a property that she owns instead of renting a room. However, I accepted the Mother’s argument that the Child was already in the Singapore schooling system and there would be no guarantee that the Mother would be able to find a well-paying job in China under these current circumstances. At least in Singapore, the Mother was still gainfully employed.

21     The Father works as an IT professional at a large company. Based on his Notice of Assessment for the Financial Year of 2020, including bonuses, the Father was earning an average of S$11,870.25.00 a month. His earlier Notices of Assessment for Financial Years 2018 and 2019 showed that the Father experienced about a 10% increase income between 2018 and 2019 as well as 2019 to 2020. The Father claimed to have monthly expenses of S$4,884.00 before paying for the expenses of the Child and his 2 other children. The Father further estimated that the expenses for his 2 other children would amount to about S$1,100.00 per month. Even if the Court accepted the Father’s claimed expenses, the Father appears to have sufficient funds to pay an additional S$50.00 a month for the Child’s increased school fees.

22     Near the close of proceedings, the Father raised his doubt over whether the Child actually attended the purported local school, as the Father had led cross-examination questions on whether the Mother was aware of the student concession card and reduced library fees available to the Child as well as certain facilities that the local school offered such as a school dental clinic and the Mother did not appear to be cognisant of such cheaper rates and free services. The Father attested that he had chosen not to exercise his right to access to the Child, as such he did not have any direct evidence from the Child. He had also not previously requested for evidence that the Child was attending the local school.

23     The Mother swore on oath that the Child was indeed studying in Singapore in the particular alleged local primary school. The Mother was further encouraged to share information on the Child’s schooling with the Father. Given that there was no evidence provided to prove that the Child was not studying in this local school, and that the Father merely voiced an unfounded suspicion, I found no reason to disbelieve the Mother that the Child was studying in a local primary school in Singapore and thus the Mother was paying the monthly primary school fees for a Non-ASEAN international student.

## IV.   CONCLUSION

24     In this case, on a balance of probabilities, I found that the Mother had discharged her burden of proving that there had been an increase in the Child’s school fees since the last order, which was a material change in circumstances warranting an upwards variation of the maintenance order from a monthly sum of S$660.00 to S$710.00 payable by the Father to the Mother on the 12th day of every month. I further found this to be reasonable and in the welfare of the Child.
