Ancillary Matters, Division of Assets, Adverse Inference and Wife’s Maintenance

26 April 2021

### District Judge Toh Wee San:

## Background facts

1       The parties were married in France on 1 June 1991. There are three daughters to the marriage, aged 26, 24 and 21. The daughters live in XXX, XXX. The daughters are working, except the youngest who is in university.

2       The Plaintiff-wife is 58 years old and holds dual XXX citizenship. She is currently unemployed. The Defendant-husband is 57 years old. He is a XXX citizen and the XXX of a Multinational Corporation. Both parties became Singapore Permanent Residents in September 2012. The Plaintiff shall be referred to as the “Wife” and the Defendant shall be referred to as the “Husband”.

3       During the marriage, parties resided at various countries such as XXX for the Husband’s work. Parties moved to Singapore in August 2010. By mid-2015, all the children were no longer residing in Singapore and were based in XXX. Sometime in February 2017, the Wife moved out of the matrimonial home and travelled between XXX and Singapore, staying with friends and family.

4       On 9 January 2019, the Wife commenced divorce proceedings. Interim Judgment (IJ) was granted on 2 May 2019 based on the Wife’s unreasonable behaviour. Parties had also recorded their agreement on the minor child’s care and living arrangements and maintenance for the child in the Interim Judgment.

5       The remaining ancillary matters were contested and the issues to be determined included the following: -

> (a)     Division of matrimonial assets; and

> (b)     Maintenance for the wife.

6       The matter was placed before me for hearing on 13 November, 14 December and 21 December 2020. After reviewing evidence before me, I made the ancillary matters orders on 14 January 2021. In short, I ordered equal division of the assets and some maintenance for the Wife before the AM hearing. A copy of the orders is attached.

7       The Husband filed an appeal against my decision and I now provide my decisions and reasons below, according to the issues contested by them.

## Issue 1: Operative date for the determination of the list of assets

### The Husband’s case

8       The Husband submitted that the operative date should be the date of separation (i.e. February 2017) when the Wife moved out of the matrimonial home.

9       The Husband referred to _Wong Kien Keong v Khoo Hoon Eng <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGHC 275</span>; <span class="citation">\[2014\] 1 SLR 1342</span> (“Wong Kien Keong”)_ at \[100\] where the High Court reiterated that there were multiple dates that the Court could adopt as the operative date. In that case, the High Court adopted the date that the Deed of Separation was signed as the date of separation and the operative date for determination of the matrimonial pool.

10     The Husband argued that the present case was similar to _Wong Kien Keong_ in that parties’ relationship had already deteriorated sometime in mid-2012[^1]. The Husband had also started sleeping in the daughter’s bedroom when she moved to university. Notwithstanding this, the Husband argued that it was clear that parties were no longer a union and had moved on with different partners when the Wife moved out in February 2017[^2].

### The Wife’s case

11     The Wife disagreed with the Husband and submitted that the operative date should be the date of the IJ (i.e. May 2019) as there were no cogent reasons to depart from the default position as reiterated by the Court of Appeal in _BPC v BPB and another appeal <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGCA 3</span>; <span class="citation">\[2019\] 1 SLR 608</span>_ at \[23\].

12     The Wife also referred me to _ARY x ARX and another appeal <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGCA 13</span>; <span class="citation">\[2016\] 2 SLR 686</span>_ where the Court of Appeal stated at \[40\] that separation is an ordinary factual concomitant of a failed marriage. If the date of separation was accepted, then it would the operative date for every divorce which would confuse the position at law. The Wife also distinguished the present case from _Wong Kien Keong_ whereby the parties in that case had signed a Deed of Separation that signified parties’ very intent to separate.

### The Court’s decision on operative date

13     I adopted the IJ date i.e. 2 May 2019 as the operative date of list of assets. This is the default position unless exceptional facts merit a departure. The Husband’s counsel argued that parties separated before IJ and led separate lives with their new partners, hence meriting a departure. I was not persuaded. If this was the case, all divorces based on separation would have to adopt the separation and not the IJ date as the operative date. This is not the legal position. Moreover, parties were looking after their joint property in XXX. They were also in contact and caring for their children who reside overseas.

## Issue 2: Division of matrimonial assets

### Parties’ position on list of matrimonial assets and value

14     Parties’ position on the pool of matrimonial assets and their respective values are based on the Joint Summary (dated 9 December 2020) filed on 17 December 2020. They are as follows: -

### Husband’s position on the division of assets

15     In respect of the division of matrimonial assets, the Husband referred to _TNL v TNK <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 15</span>_ (“_TNL v TNK_”) where the Court of Appeal clarified that in long single-income marriage, the Courts tend towards an equal division of matrimonial assets[^3].

16     Despite this, the Husband argued that it would not be just and equitable in this present case to accord an equal division of the matrimonial assets to the parties. His reasons were as follows[^4]: -

> (a)     The Wife did not make substantive contributions by increasing the value of the matrimonial assets and had in fact placed parties in the position of a loss for the XXX property as it was the significant investment that the Wife wanted to acquire;

> (b)     Little of the Wife’s income during her part-time work up to 2016 was used towards the family’s expenses;

> (c)     Even though the Husband was the primary breadwinner, he raised the children and took care of the family with the Wife;

> (d)     The Wife had the assistance of the Husband’s mother or the assistance of a helper coupled with a chauffeur for 7 years;

> (e)     Credit ought to be given to the Husband for the investments he made which increased the pool of assets; and

> (f)     An adverse inference should be drawn against the Wife for her failure to disclose documents that were incriminating towards her.

17     Accordingly, the Husband submitted that the pool of matrimonial assets should be divided in the proportion of 60% in favour of him and 40% in favour of the Wife[^5].

### Wife’s position on the division of assets

18     The Wife similarly referred to _TNL v TNK_ and submitted that since this was a single-income marriage that subsisted for 28 years, the ratio for division would minimally be 50:50[^6].

19     The Wife claimed that she had made significant non-financial contributions to the family when she gave up her promising career prospects and followed her Husband to his home country. The Wife argued that she was a trailing spouse who had relocated several times during the marriage for the Husband’s job which facilitated and enabled the Husband’s career success at the expense of her own[^7]. In addition, the Husband travelled frequently and she was often the parent who had to run the household and provide care for the three children[^8]. The Wife had also invited the Court to draw an adverse inference against the Husband for being uncooperative during the discovery process and remained evasive about the full extent of his assets[^9].

20     Accordingly, the Wife submitted that she should receive an uplift of 10% and for the ratio of division of assets to be 60:40 in her favour[^10].

21     The Wife also took the position that the Husband had made several withdrawals from his bank accounts and these monies ought to be accounted for[^11]:-

> (a)     Husband had withdrawn a sum of S$40,05909 from his XXX Account in July 2019 and had not accounted for S$17,759.09 which therefore should be added back into the pool for division;

> (b)     Husband had siphoned away matrimonial funds from November 2014 to July 2019 amounting to S$923,574 which should be added back into the pool for division; and

> (c)     Husband made large withdrawals from his HSBC accounts, UOB accounts and BNP account from January 2015 to October 2019 amounting to S$271,895 that ought to be added back into the pool for division.

### Court’s decision on the ratio for division of matrimonial assets

22     As this was a long marriage of 28 years, I ordered for parties to have an equal share from the division of the matrimonial assets subject to the following rulings on the issues in dispute which I shall deal with in the paragraphs below.

## Issue 3: XXX property held in joint names and the rental proceeds

23     It is not dispute that the XXX property was a matrimonial asset within the definition of s 112(10) of the Women’s Charter (WC). However, both parties disputed the value and division of the XXX Property and the rental proceeds.

24     The XXX property was acquired in April 2012 by a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands which Husband and Wife each have 50% share of. The XXX property was a holiday home for the family and was rented out on a short-term basis[^12].

### The Wife’s case

25     The Wife valued the XXX property at S$578,000 (equivalent to USD425,000) which was based on the purchase price of the said property[^13]. The Wife submitted that the XXX property ought to be sold in open market and the sale proceeds to be divided in the ratio of 60:40 in her favour[^14].

26     The Wife also argued that the total rental proceeds from the XXX property amounted to THB 1,398,750 from December 2015 to January 2019[^15] and THB 150,000 per month for a period of one year commencing 10 August 2019[^16]. The Wife claimed that the rental proceeds were deposited into the Husband’s Thai bank account and the Husband had agreed in principle to divide in equal shares the rental income received from August 2019 onwards less the running costs[^17]. Accordingly, the Wife also asked for an order for the Husband to pay her half-share of the net rental proceeds from August 2019.

### The Husband’s case

27     The Husband took the position that the XXX Property was valued at S$450,000[^18]. This was based on the estimated value from a “distressed sale” considering the ongoing land-lease issues[^19]. The Husband submitted that the XXX property ought to be sold and divided in accordance to the division of the total pool of matrimonial assets, being 60:40 in his favour.

28     In respect of the rental proceeds, the Husband argued that the running costs of the XXX property amounted to about THB 4 million from May 2015 to October 2020[^20] and the rental proceeds over these five years amounted to approximately THB 2.8 million[^21]. As such, the Husband claimed that he had to transfer more than THB 1.4 million from his personal HSBC account in Singapore to pay for the running costs that was not covered by the rental proceeds[^22].

29     The Husband clarified that he was in principle agreeable to share in equal proportions the rental income less the running costs. However, in this case, the running costs were significantly higher than the rental income. In fact, the Husband argued that the Wife ought to bear her half share of the remaining running costs that the rental proceeds could not cover[^23].

### The Court’s decision

30     In view of the foregoing, I decided in principle, both parties shall be entitled to an equal share of the net proceeds received in relation to the XXX property.

31     Parties shall jointly sell off the property within 6 months. They may also jointly value the property if need be. The net proceeds refer to both the sale and rental proceeds after deducting the costs incurred in connection with this property before its disposal. I opine that this approach is just and consistent with the philosophy behind the Wife’s request for 50% of the net rental proceeds from August 2019 to August 2020.

32     The rental proceeds were deposited into the Krungthai bank account in the Husband’s name. However, parties shall be entitled to an equal share of the monies after closing the account. The outstanding monies from the property should be equally divided between parties. For illustration, the net sale proceeds from this property is around S$500,000 and the net rental proceeds from this property is around S$30,000. Parties should receive about S$265,000 each after division.

## Issue 4: Husband’s XXX stock options

33     Both parties agreed that the gross value of the Husband’s XXX stock options was S$291,104.73. However, parties could not agree whether all the Husband’s stock options fell within the matrimonial pool for division, whether tax liability should be deducted from the said value and whether the Wife was entitled to a share of the stock options.

34     The Husband’s XXX stocks can be categorized as follows[^24]: -

> (a)     The first batch of shares amounting to 2,392 shares which were awarded on 10 May 2017 vested three years later in February 2020 (the “first batch of shares”);

> (b)     The second batch of shares amounting to 2,152 shares which were awarded on 16 May 2018 (the “second batch of shares”); and

> (c)     The third batch of shares amounting to 2,625 shares were awarded on 15 May 2019 (i.e. two weeks after date of IJ) which will vest in January 2022 (the “third batch of shares”).

### The Husband’s case

35     The Husband referred to _Leong Mei Chuan v Chan Teck Hock David \[2001\] SGHC 801_ where the High Court had classified stock options into three categories, namely, (a) stock options which were vested and exercised by the date of IJ with profits made (“Category 1 stocks”); (b) stock options which were vested but not yet exercised on the date of IJ (“Category 2 stocks”); and (c) stock options which were not vested in the date of IJ (“Category 3 stocks”).

36     The Husband also referred to _Chan Teck Hock David v Leong Mei Chuan <span class="citation">\[2002\] SGCA 3</span>_ (“_Chan Teck Hock David_”) where the Court of Appeal held that the Category 2 stock options are considered as matrimonial assets while Category 3 stocks are choses in action and therefore also matrimonial assets.

37     In respect of the first and second batches of shares, the Husband submitted that whilst they form part of the matrimonial pool, the Wife should not be entitled to them as the shares were awarded to him long after the marriage had broken down which was about three months after the Wife left the matrimonial home. In this regard, the Husband argued that the Wife’s direct and indirect contributions towards the asset would be zero. The Husband also submitted that in any event, the shares were vested on the Husband after the date of the IJ[^25]. In respect of the third batch of shares, the Husband submitted that as these were awarded two weeks after the date of IJ, it would not fall within the matrimonial pool for division[^26].

38     Separately, the Husband submitted that the tax liability that would be payable from Year of Assessment for 2021 amounting to S$64,043.04 ought to be deducted from the gross value of the stock options. He explained that the first award of the Signify stock was in May 2017 and vested three years later in February 2020. Hence, the tax is payable from YA 2021. As his salary, allowances and bonus are above S$320,000 per annum, the tax rate of 22% would apply and his tax liability would be S$64,043.04, being 22% of S$291,104.73[^27].

### The Wife’s case

39     The Wife argued that the Husband’s XXX stocks fell within Category 1 and Category 2 and were matrimonial assets: -

> (a)     The stock options that were granted from 2014 to 2016 which were vested three years later and exercised / sold by the Husband in June 2019 and August 2019 for €60,755 and €370,368.45 were Category 1 stocks. The sale proceeds were also deposited into the Husband’s XXX account and therefore fell within the matrimonial pool[^28].

> (b)     The stock options that were granted from 2017 to 2019 but had not been vested on him were Category 2 stocks which were acquired during the marriage[^29]. Specifically, the first and second batches of shares were vested on the Husband before date of IJ and the third batch of shares was granted very close to IJ (i.e. only two weeks after)[^30]. Documents showed that the third batch of shares were granted to incentivize the employee to continue working in the company and the Wife argued that it was logical to deduce that the stock options were granted to reward the employee for the previous year’s work which was already done[^31]. In particular, even though the third batch of shares were vested after IJ, it was granted for work done by the Husband from May 2018 to May 2019 which was a period largely before the date of IJ and in line with the definition of matrimonial assets under s 112(10)(b) of the WC[^32].

40     The Wife disagreed with the Husband’s argument that she was not entitled to any share of the stock options even if they fell within the matrimonial pool of assets. The Wife argued that there was no basis for a different percentage to be applied to the division of assets acquired during the period of separation as compared to the assets acquired before that and submitted that the Court should consider holistically the contributions made by both parties when determining an overall division of all the matrimonial assets[^33].

41     In view of the above, the Wife submitted that all three batches of the Husband’s stock options should be included in the matrimonial pool and divided equally given that it was a long marriage as per _TNL v TNK_[^34]_._

42     As for the tax liability, the Wife submitted that the last known average tax rate of 17.8% should apply. Therefore, the tax liability was 17.8% of S$291,104.73 = S$51,816.64[^35].

### The Court’s decision

43     I considered the evidence before me and took the view that all three batches of the Husband’s stock options fell within the matrimonial pool to be divided. The first two batches were issued before the IJ date. The third batch was issued shortly after the IJ date but for work done largely before the IJ date and I was persuaded by the Wife’s submissions to include them.

44     However I was not persuaded to adopt the values per se, put forth by the Wife. Instead I determined the values of these options by using the time rule approach advocated by the higher Courts with modification. Instead of the number of stock options, I multiplied the value of the stock options in question by the ratio of the duration of the employment to IJ date against the duration of the employment to vesting date. I deducted the tax payable at 22% of the option values upon acceptance of the Husband’s submissions. The sale proceeds from the options differed from and were in addition to Husband’s regular employment income thus attracting the higher tax rate. In conclusion, the options’ values were as follows: -

45     Accordingly, the total value of the Husband’s stock options to be included in the matrimonial pool is S$162,885, being the sum of S$62,946, S$36,121 and S$63,818.

## Issue 5: Husband’s tax liabilities for XXX securities

### The Husband’s case

46     The Husband stated that he continued to pay tax until May 2021 and his outstanding tax liability of S$76,171.63 as at October 2019 ought to be deducted from the matrimonial pool. The tax liability of S$76,171.63 was derived from the following[^36]: -

> (a)     Grant of 4,620 shares in 2015 valued at S$261,132 (€164,148.60) was vested in 2018 with tax payable from YA2019. As the Husband’s salary, allowances and bonus were above the ceiling of S$320,000 per annum, the rate of tax payable was 22%. Therefore, the tax payable for the said shares amounted to S$57,449.04. However, as at October 2019, the tax payable was not paid in full. There was an outstanding amount of S$29,955 that remained unpaid.

> (b)     Grant of shares in 2016 valued at S$210,075.60 was vested in 2019 with tax payable in YA2020. Tax payable was therefore S$46,216.63, being 22% of S$210,075.60.

> (c)     In view of the above, the outstanding tax payable was S$76,171.63, being the sum of S$29,955 and S$46,216.63.

### The Court’s decision

47     I considered the Husband’s submissions and adopted the tax rate at 22% which was consistent with my decision above too. The tax payable at S$76,171.63 shall be deducted from the HSBC Accounts and the final amount in the said accounts is S$648,161.19.

## Issue 6: Husband’s XXX Club membership

### Parties’ position

48     The Husband argued that the XXX Club membership was valued at S$37,450 which was based on the membership fees that he had paid[^37].

49     On the other hand, the Wife submitted that the Husband had undervalued the XXX Club membership. The Wife explained that XXX Club had introduced a Membership Transfer Scheme that allows Ordinary Members to sell their membership back to the Club. The Member would stand to gain S$64,690 from the sell-back[^38]. As such, the Wife submitted that the value of the XXX Club membership should be S$64,690.

### The Court’s decision

50     I considered the evidence before me and adopted the net value provided by the Club to be S$ 64,690.

## Issue 7: Husband’s inheritance monies from Husband’s father and sister

51     The Husband’s inheritance monies amounted to €90,882.16 (S$137,741), being €66,082.16 from his father’s inheritance and €24,800 from his sister’s inheritance. It was not disputed that part of the inheritance monies were utilized towards payment of parties’ first matrimonial home, the XXX property, which was held in parties’ joint names. It was also not disputed that the sale proceeds from the XXX property amounting to €570,834.96 was deposited into parties’ XXX joint account[^39]. The issue in dispute was whether the said inheritance monies ought to be excluded in the matrimonial pool for division.

### The Wife’s case

52     The Wife submitted that since the inheritance monies were used to acquire the XXX property, this piece of asset was transformed into a matrimonial asset. She further submitted that there had been intermingling of the inheritance monies and matrimonial funds which may have been subsequently utilized to purchase the XXX property. As such, the inheritance monies should not be excluded from the matrimonial pool[^40].

### The Husband’s case

53     The Husband argued that whilst the inheritance sum was used towards the acquisition of the XXX property, the Wife had expressly acknowledged at the time of the purchase that she would not contest the ownership of those funds[^41].

54     The Husband also stated that while the sale proceeds from the XXX property were deposited into the BNP joint account and have intermingled with the matrimonial funds therein, it was the Husband who invested these net proceeds and generated investment profits. He further argued that the inheritance sums had not been substantially improved during the marriage by the Wife as the XXX property was purchased using the Husband’s own income and savings[^42]. Accordingly, the Husband submitted that the inheritance monies should not form part of the matrimonial pool.

### The Court’s decision

55     I considered the submissions made by both parties and declined to exclude the inheritance from the matrimonial pool. Such monies were put into parties’ joint account and subsequently used to acquire a matrimonial property i.e. the XXX property many years ago. Under Singapore law, the monies qualify as matrimonial assets and should be included.

## Issue 8: Husband’s unaccounted withdrawal of S$17,759.09 from XXX account

56     It was undisputed that the Husband had withdrawn a sum of S$40,059.09 from his XXX account in July 2019. However, parties are in dispute on whether the Husband had fully accounted for the said sum.

### The Husband’s case

57     The Husband argued that he had accounted for the S$17,759.09 and had referred to his UOB statement for August 2019 where it reflected that a sum of S$4,700 was paid towards his IRAS income tax, a sum of S$4,443.90 was paid towards his girlfriend’s son’s school fees and a sum of S$4,000 was paid towards his girlfriend as additional allowance. He further averred that the remaining monies were used to pay towards miscellaneous expenses and ATM withdrawals[^43]. Accordingly, he submitted that the S$17,759.09 should not be added back into the matrimonial pool.

### The Wife’s case

58     The Wife argued that out of the S$40,059.09, the Husband had transferred S$15,300 into his UOB SRS account and S$7,000 into his CPF accounts.[^44] However, there was still a balance of S$17,759.09 that remained unaccounted which should be added back into the matrimonial pool for division.[^45] The Wife further argued during the hearing that the Husband did not have a legal duty to pay for the girlfriend’s expenses.

### The Court’s decision

59     Having considered parties’ respective submissions and the evidence before me, out of the S$17,759, I declined to add back S$4,700 into the matrimonial pool as the Husband had used this sum to pay for taxes. As for the remaining S$13,059 (allegedly used for the Husband’s girlfriend and her related expenses), I took the view that these should be added back to the pool as they did not fall under matrimonial expenses.

## Issue 9: Husband’s withdrawal of S$923,574 from HSBC bank accounts

### The Wife’s case

60     The Wife averred that from November 2014 to July 2019, the Husband had transferred a total of S$923,574 from his HSBC (Singapore) bank accounts to female companions and into his UOB bank account where he made subsequent transfers of monies to his girlfriend. The Wife referred to bank statements reflecting that the Husband had transferred an average of S$14,646 per month to the girlfriend[^46].

61     As such, the Wife argued that out of S$923,574, a sum of S$629,768 was paid to the Husband’s girlfriend and parked under her name to ringfence it from division and the remaining S$293,806 remained unaccounted for and likely to have been siphoned away to other women[^47]. Accordingly, the Wife submitted that the total sum of S$923,574 should be returned to the matrimonial pool for division[^48].

### The Husband’s case

62     The Husband does not dispute that he had transferred monies to female companions and the S$5,000 every month to his girlfriend after he went into a relationship with her. In addition, the Husband explained that there were occasions where he had paid his girlfriend more than S$5,000 a month. However, these additional payments were meant to reimburse the girlfriend when she ran errands for him and incurred household and shopping expenses on his behalf. The Husband also averred that he had assisted the girlfriend to pay for other expenses such as her children’s school fees and daily expenses, and her family’s hospitalization expenses and financial support[^49].

63     In any event, the Husband referred to _UYZ v UYA <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGFC 84</span>_ (“_UYZ v UYA_”) at \[46\] where the Court had found the husband in that case to have expended S$190,000 on a woman and held that it amounted to dissipation of assets which ought to be returned to the asset pool. However, the Husband distinguished the present case from _UYZ v UYA_ and highlighted that unlike that case, parties’ marriage was no longer functioning as early as September 2012 and the Wife had already started leading her own life as evident in her bank and credit card records. As such, the Husband submitted that the expenses expended by him for the girlfriend cannot be considered as illegitimate expenses or expenditure amounting to dissipation as it was not a situation where the Wife was kept in the dark of the Husband’s new partner or vice versa[^50].

64     In respect of the remaining S$293,809, the Husband referred to bank statements showing that a large part of the monies transferred from the HSBC (Singapore) accounts to the UOB account were used to pay for administrative payments such as income tax, road tax, etc[^51]. Accordingly, the Husband submitted that he should not be required to return the S$923,574 to the matrimonial pool.

### The Court’s decision

65     The Husband’s explanation was he had spent S$713,245.76[^52] on female companions, his girlfriend and his personal expenses which were paid through his girlfriend. The remaining S$210,328.24 was spent on personal expenses such as taxes.

66     Matrimonial assets are generally valued at the ancillary matters hearing date but not bank account balances. In the present instance, the amounts in the bank account would be determined at the IJ date[^53]. As such, I would only claw back the monies dissipated before the IJ date. From 14 March 2015 to 1 May 2019, the Husband allegedly transferred a total of S$653,796 to other women and his girlfriend. I was prepared to accept that from such withdrawals, the Husband had used an average of S$2,000 per month for legitimate personal expenses or his share of such expenses, through his girlfriend from April 2016 to April 2019. This would amount to S$72,000. As for the remaining amounts spent on other women and his girlfriend, I agreed with the Wife’s submissions that they did not amount to legitimate personal expenses. However, I accepted that the Husband had spent S$210,328.24 on legitimate expenses such as taxes. In conclusion, the amount to be added back was S$653,796 less S$72,000 = S$581,796 (rounded off).

## Issue 10: Husband’s withdrawal of S$264,495 from his HSBC and other accounts from January 2015 to October 2019

67     Initially, the Wife had submitted that the Husband had withdrawn S$271,895 from his various bank accounts from January 2015 to October 2019. However, the Wife’s counsels highlighted that there had been an error in the calculations and the total amount should be S$264,495 instead[^54].

68     It was not disputed that a total sum of S$264,495 was withdrawn from the various bank accounts. However, parties are in dispute as to whether the sum ought to be returned to the matrimonial pool for division.

### The Wife’s case

69     The Wife averred that during the discovery process, the Husband had claimed that the S$264,495 was utilized to pay for expenses such as cigarettes, eating and drinking and small shopping expenses.

70     However, the Wife took the view that it was untenable for the Husband to require so much cash withdrawals especially when parties mostly paid for their expenses _via_ credit card. Using the initial value of S$271,895, this would mean that the Husband utilized S$4,687 (being S$271,895 divided by 58 months) per month on such expenses[^55].

### The Husband’s case

71     However, the Husband took the position that a sum of S$4,687 per month was not unreasonable and are genuine withdrawals for his own purposes. The Husband had also referred to the Wife’s bank statements and claimed that her spending of S$378,249 from 2015 to 2019 amounted to approximately S$6,500 worth of spending a month[^56].

72     Accordingly, the Husband argued that it was unreasonable to conclude that the S$271,895 was siphoned off by him and for it to be returned to the pool for division.

### The Court’s decision

73     For the same reasons above in relation to the Husband’s withdrawal of S$923,574, I would only claw back monies dissipated before the IJ date. From January 2015 to 1 May 2019, the Husband withdrew a total of S$248,695. The Husband’s story was he spent the monies on petty cash items. However, the Husband had only listed S$1,000 per month for his petty cash spending in his list of expenses[^57]. Accepting this, the Husband’s permitted cash spending would be S$52,000 from January 2015 to April 2019. After deducting S$52,000, S$196,695 should be added back to the pool.

## Issue 11: Husband’s XXX account, two inheritance French properties and retirement fund

### The Husband’s case

74     In respect of the XXX account, the Husband averred that it was a dormant brokerage account with no value. It was merely maintained in order to gain access to their online stock news and research. According to the Husband, the last balance of S$40,059.07 was transferred into his UOB account on 23 July 2019 and was used largely for voluntary contributions to his SRS and CPF[^58].

75     As for the two inheritance French properties, the Husband submitted that pursuant to French law, the two properties belong to his mother until she passes away and the Husband cannot sell or collect rent from the said properties nor does he have any responsibilities for the upkeep of the said properties. Accordingly, the two French properties should not be included in the pool of matrimonial assets[^59].

76     In relation to the Husband’s French retirement fund, the Husband averred that his current contribution was €2,454 per quarter and that he had to contribute for 42 years in order to benefit from the retirement payout. The estimated payout would range from €4,053 to €4,922 per month, depending on whether he retires at 62 or 67 years old[^60].

### The Wife’s case

77     In respect of the XXX account, the Wife took the position that the Husband had only provided statements that indicate that the last stocks were acquired on 4 February 2014. However, he had not furnished any documentary proof to support his claim that the account was dormant with nil balance as at October 2019[^61].

78     In relation to the two French inheritance properties, the Wife argued that the title searches indicate that the Husband has “joint bare ownership” of the said properties and submitted that they should be considered as part of the matrimonial pool[^62].

79     As for the French retirement fund, the Wife noted that the Husband had contributed a portion of his monthly salary into the said fund which guaranteed him a monthly payout upon his retirement until he dies. The Wife also highlighted that it was the Husband’s own evidence that he paid S$1,235.18 (€818) per month towards the said fund. However, as the Wife was not able to value the retirement fund, she submitted that she should have an uplift in her ratio for division especially since she would not be receiving a division of the payout[^63].

### The Court’s decision

80     I took the view that the Husband’s XXX account was comparable to the Wife’s Bali bank account. Parties did not disclose any conclusive documents in each of their affidavits.

81     The Husband’s two French inheritance properties did not fall under the legal meaning of matrimonial asset for division and were not included into the matrimonial pool.

82     In relation to the French retirement fund, I took the view that the portion of the funds accumulated throughout the marriage would qualify as matrimonial asset. The Husband had admitted that he contributed S$1,235.18 per month presently, of which about 27% was for medical insurance and 73% for retirement savings[^64]. In the absence of clearer evidence, I assumed that throughout the 28-year marriage, this would amount to about S$300,000 of the Husband’s retirement savings (rounded off) which should be added to the pool.

## Issue 12: Division of matrimonial assets

83     In view of the above, and considering the Joint Summary (dated 9 December 2020) filed on 17 December 2020, the division of matrimonial assets are as follows: -

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="9.44%"> <col width="52.82%"> <col width="37.74%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>S/n</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Asset</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Value</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="b" colspan="3" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><em>XXX property and joint HSBC account</em></b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">50% of the indicative net XXX property proceeds</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">50% x S$500,000</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">= S$250,000</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">50% of Krungthai bank account</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">50% x S$31,032.91</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">= S$15,516</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">50% of HSBC joint account</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">50% x S$451.28</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">= S$225.64</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="right" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Each party will receive</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>S$265,000 (rounded off)</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="b" colspan="3" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><em>Other assets</em></b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Husband’s assets in sole name (including the amounts clawed back)</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">S$3,724 584.28</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">5.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Wife’s assets in sole name</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">S$35,732.42</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="right" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Total value of other assets</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>S$3,760,316.70</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>50% share for the Wife while still allowing her to retain her assets in sole name, means the Husband should pay to the Wife S$1,844,425.90 (rounded off).</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

84     The Husband should pay the Wife S$1,844,425.90 (rounded off). However, the Husband should deduct the S$355,500 given to the Wife as advance payments[^65]. In conclusion, the Husband shall pay the Wife S$1,488,926. Adding her share from the XXX property proceeds, the Wife will receive a total of about S$1,750,000 from asset division.

## Issue 13: Maintenance for the wife

### The Wife’s case

85     The Wife sought an order for maintenance of S$10,000 per month. The Wife referred to the factors in s 114(1) of the WC and _Quek Lee Tiam v Ho Kim Swee (alias Ho Kian Guan) <span class="citation">\[1995\] SGHC 23</span>_ and argued that she should be maintained at a standard of living commensurate with what she had enjoyed during the marriage[^66]. She also argued that her share of the division of matrimonial assets would not be so large such that an order of maintenance was not necessary[^67].

86     The Wife averred that the Husband had provided a comfortable standard of living for her prior to the breakdown of the marriage. Her personal expenses charged to her supplementary credit card amounted to S$6,000 to S$8,000 per month. In addition, the Husband would pay for her share of the household expenses and would budget for her to travel, dine out, entertain and purchase gifts, etc. The Wife further averred that the sum of S$5,000 that the Husband had provided her during the time of their separation was entirely insufficient to meet her needs[^68]. The Wife claimed that her reasonable expenses amounted to S$10,000 per month, regardless whether she chose to reside in Singapore or in XXX[^69].

87     The Wife further argued that it was not realistic to expect her to secure gainful employment. She did not complete her university education and was out of the workforce for most years of the marriage. In addition, the Wife was 58 years old which is close to the retirement age, reducing her chances of being employed especially given the present job market[^70].

88     In contrast, the Wife averred that the Husband had always been the primary breadwinner and earned an average of S$48,292.04 per month. He has passive income which amounted to approximately S$4,560.92 per month and would receive his French retirement fund payout in 2025[^71]. The Wife also took the position that the Husband’s expenses of S$39,971 per month was inflated[^72].

89     The Wife further submitted that the maintenance order of S$10,000 ought to be backdated to June 2017 when the Husband had repeatedly refused her request for more maintenance and that she should not be prejudiced for failing to make an application for interim maintenance. Accordingly, the Wife submitted that the total backdated maintenance from June 2017 to November 2020 payable by the Husband to her amounted to S$205,000[^73].

### The Husband’s case

90     The Husband referred to _BG v BF <span class="citation">\[2007\] 3 SLR(R) 233</span>_ at \[75\] where the Court of Appeal held that the Court had to take into account each party’s share of the matrimonial assets when determining maintenance for the wife. Reference was also made to _ARX v ARY <span class="citation">\[2015\] 2 SLR 1103</span>_ which stood for the proposition that the ex-wife’s expenses must be scaled down for reasonableness[^74].

91     The Husband submitted that the Wife had an earning capacity of at least S$1,800 per month and that she was capable of securing employment as a real estate agent in XXX where the average salary was S$177,798 per annum. The Husband also took the position that the Wife had acquired qualifications to teach English as a foreign language and had acquired skills when she was employed by the XXX government that were relevant in human resources or sales. However, the Husband averred that the Wife had not made any attempts to secure employment in XXX. Accordingly, the Husband took the view that the Wife was perfectly capable of seeking employment and sustaining herself financially. In any event, the Husband argued that the Wife would be receiving a substantial portion of the division of matrimonial assets which would be sufficient to maintain herself[^75].

92     In respect of the Wife’s standard of living prior to the breakdown of the marriage, the Husband averred that the Wife had led a typical expat-wife jet-setter lifestyle as evident in her credit card statements and travel records. The Husband cited _NI v NJ \[2007\] 1 SLR (R) 75_ where it was held that the Court should adopt a common-sense holistic approach that accords with and take into account the new realities that follow a failed marriage. The Husband also took the view that the Wife had grossly inflated her monthly expenses of S$10,000 and a sum of S$5,000 would be more appropriate[^76].

### The Court’s position

93     I considered the submissions put forth by both the Husband and the Wife. As the Wife’s maintenance post-AM orders is complementary to asset division, I opined that the Wife has received 50% of the asset pool and a fair outcome. I order no maintenance for the Wife with effect from February 2021.

94     As for whether the Wife’s maintenance amount pre-AM orders was sufficient, I opined that S$5,000 per month for the Wife was on the low side compared to before. On balance, I opined that it would be reasonable for the Husband to maintain the Wife at S$8,000 per month with effect from 1 May 2019 to 31 January 2021.

95     The Wife returned to Singapore around May 2019 after her partner’s demise and should be better supported. If she needed more funds, she should have sought employment and it would be reasonable to expect her to be able to earn at least S$1,500 to S$2,000 per month. Moreover, the lower maintenance sum led to a bigger asset pool for division, so it was not that unfair to her. Since the Husband paid the Wife S$5,000 per month, the shortfall would be S$3,000 for 20 months. The Husband has to pay the Wife S$60,000 for maintenance arrears.

## Conclusion

96     In conclusion, the Wife will receive about S$1,810,000 from the conclusion of the divorce, excluding the monthly maintenance and advancement from the Husband while retaining her assets in her name and possession.

## Costs

97     As both sides did not get what they asked for squarely, I declined to order costs against either.
