Ancillary Matters – Care and Control – Access – Division of Matrimonial Assets – Wife Maintenance – Children’s Maintenance

22 April 2019

### District Judge Suzanne Chin:

## Introduction

1       The Ancillary Matters in the divorce proceedings between the parties first came before me on 22 January 2019. After hearing from the parties, on 22 February 2019, I made ancillary orders in respect of the division of matrimonial property, care and control and access to the child of the marriage who was 4 years old (“AM orders”). The Defendant Husband has appealed against part of the AM orders, namely the orders relating to care and control and some of the access provided for, the division of matrimonial property and medical and dental coverage for the child.

## Brief Background

2       The parties were married on xxx 2014. The Plaintiff Wife who was 33 years old at the time of the proceedings and worked as a receptionist commenced divorce proceedings on 14 September 2017 citing the Husbands’ unreasonable behaviour as grounds for divorce. The Husband, a forty-year old Supply Chain Professional, filed a Defence and Counterclaim. Eventually however, parties agreed to proceed with the divorce on an uncontested basis on both an amended Claim and Counterclaim on the grounds of each parties’ respective unreasonable behaviour. Interim Judgement was granted on 26 February 2018 making this a marriage of 3 years and 5 months.

3       Parties lived apart for most of the marriage. Immediately after the marriage, the parties continued to live separately in their respective parents’ homes as the construction of the matrimonial home had not been completed. The child of the marriage was born on the 1 March 2015 and these arrangements continued with the child residing with the Wife at her parents’ home.

4       In May 2016, the parties moved into the matrimonial home with the child. Unfortunately, six months later in November 2016 the marriage had broken down and the Wife left the Matrimonial Home with the child and returned to her parents’ home.

5       In February 2017, the Husband commenced OSGxxx/2017 applying for the return of the child as well as a determination of the custody, care and control and access of the child. OSGxxx/2017 was heard and orders were made on the 23 October 2017 granting joint custody of the child to the parties, with care and control to the Wife and very liberal prescribed access to the Husband. The orders also included payment of child maintenance by the Husband to the Wife (“OSG Orders”). The Husband appealed against the OSG orders and the appeal was dismissed by the High Court Division of the Family Justice Courts on 23 April 2018.

## AM orders and the Husband’s appeal

6       During the hearing of the ancillary matters, I made the following orders:

_A_.     _Custody, Care and Control and Access_

_12_.     _The Plaintiff shall sign the ECDA childcare subsidy forms and all other forms relating to child care subsidy within 7 days of the Defendant providing this to her._

_13_.     _Liberty to apply._

7       The Husband has appealed against my orders granting sole care and control of the child to the Wife as well as all of my orders providing him with access to the child of the marriage. In addition, he has appealed against my decision on the division of the matrimonial assets and my orders relating to the medical expenses for the child.

8       I will explain below, the reasons for my decision on the orders which the Husband has appealed against.

## Care and control and access

#### The Husband’s case

9       The Husband contended that care and control of the child should be reversed and granted to him instead of the Wife as access had been made difficult on 1 or 2 occasions. The child had apparently been fussy and the Wife had done nothing to facilitate access. He added that he had been denied access during public holidays. In addition, the Husband explained that the Wife had originally not wanted the child and had wanted to undergo an abortion. Without his persuasion, the child would not even exist[^1]. He also maintained that the Wife had always viewed the child as being a burden to her and did not invest time in the child often not attending the child’s school activities and spending time with the child only before and after work[^2]. He also referred to the unilateral decisions that the Wife had made in respect of the child, specifically, her removing the child from the matrimonial home, taking the child out of the country without his knowledge or consent on many occasions, changing the child’s schools, refusing to sign the requisite forms for school fees subsidies and not allowing him to have access to the child during public holidays. He claimed that the Wife often used the child as a pawn between them and not acting in the best interests of the child. He contended further that she was a negative influence on the child and had made many false allegations against him.

## The Legal Principles

10     On all issues relating to children, the paramount consideration is the welfare of the children as encapsulated in sections 3 and 11 of the Guardianship of Infants Act (Cap 122) and sections 124 and 125 of the Women’s Charter. In _IW v IX_ \[2005\] SGCA 48 Chao Hick Tin JA delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal held:

\[26\]  “It is clear to us that the paramount consideration in every case where custody is in issue is the welfare of the child. That is the immutable principle. The term “welfare” should be taken in its widest sense and we do not think it is possible or desirable to define it. In _Tan Siew Kee v Chua Ah Boey_ \[1987\] SLR (R) 725, Chan Sek Keong JC (as he then was), in reference to the term “welfare”, said (at 551):

\[12\]   It means the general well-being of the child and all aspects of his upbringing, religious, moral as well as physical. His happiness, comfort and security also go to make up his well-being. A loving parent with a stable home is conducive to the attainment of such well-being. It is not to be measured in monetary terms.”

\[27\]   What would be in the interests of the child must necessarily depend on all the circumstances of the case. The court, where appropriate, will have regard to the factors the wife had mentioned, _ie_, maintaining status quo, preservation of mother-child bond and that siblings should not be separated. Other factors will include the home environment and care arrangements made for the child, the conduct of the parties, and the wishes of the child. We must reiterate that this enumeration is not meant to be exhaustive. The court will have to carry out a balancing exercise to determine, as between the two parents, to whom custody should be given in the best interests of the child. A factor which may be determinant in one case may not necessarily be so in another. So the weight to be given to each factor may vary from case to case. No precise formulation is possible. This is not a scientific exercise but one of judgment.”

## Decision on Care and Control and Access

#### Care and Control

11     While I considered each of the above, with regard to item 5, I noted that there was no evidence to show that the Wife had in fact been denying the Husband access to the child. In fact based on the current access orders made by the court in OSGxxx/2017, it appeared to me that the Husband was seeing the child every weekday as he picked the child from the Wife’s residence in the morning and sent her to school. After school, he would pick the child up at 4.30pm, spend 2 hours with the child then send her back to the Wife’s residence by 6.30pm. On Fridays, instead of dropping the child off at the Wife’s residence, the child would on a weekly basis spend the night with him and he would only return the child to the Wife’s residence at 5.30pm on the Saturday. It was undisputed that the Husband had not had access to the child on public holidays and I will address this in my access orders. It was, as such, clear to me that the Husband was enjoying regular and very liberal access to the child and if indeed handover had been difficult on 1 or 2 occasions, I did not consider that this was sufficient justification for a reversal of care and control.

12     With regard to the Husband’s other contentions about the unilateral decisions made by the Wife, the Wife saying that the child had been a burden to her and her allegations against him about his having abused the child, I noted these had existed prior to the OSGxxx/2017 court orders and had been considered by the court. With regard to the Wife having said that the child had been a burden to her, I found that apart from his bare assertion which was denied by the Wife, the Husband did not provide any evidence to support his claim.

13     The fact that the child had been living with the Wife since November 2016, the fact that the Wife has been the primary caregiver of the child since then and the age of the child were all considerations which I took into account in coming to my decision. Taking all of this together, I did not think that there was sufficient justification for the status quo to be disturbed and accordingly taking into account the child’s best interest, I granted sole care and control of the child to the Wife with access to the Husband.

#### Access

14     On the issue of access, it was my observation that access as ordered in the OSGxxx/2017 orders was working out well. As the Wife had to go to work during office hours, the Husband who had a more flexible work schedule could spend time with the child daily. The access orders facilitated a situation where the child was given the opportunity to develop a bond with each parent.

15     The Wife was happy to continue with current access arrangements save that she wanted the arrangements modified so that Husband would only pick the child and send her to school on Thursday and Friday. She argued that she or her parents should be allowed to send the child to school for some of the days as this had resulted in the school only updating the Husband on the child’s progress. First of all, I do not see how sending the child to school in the mornings would make a difference in updates on the child’s progress. There is nothing to stop the Wife from contacting the school to find out about the child’s progress. Having said this, I do understand that the Wife may want to enjoy the experience of taking the child to school for some of the week and accordingly I was prepared to modify the OSGxxx/2017 order such that on Tuesdays and Thursdays, the Wife (and not the Wife’s parents) would be allowed to send the child to school in the mornings. My orders contemplated that where the Wife was unable to do so for whatever reason, the Wife would provide the Husband with no less than 24 hours’ notice, in which event, the Husband would pick up the child from her residence as was the arrangement on the other weekdays.

16     In response to the Husband’s request for access on alternate public holidays and arrangements for Chinese New Year, I modified the OSGxxx/2017 orders to provide details of access arrangements in this regard.

## Division of the Matrimonial Assets

## The Matrimonial pool

17     I now turn to the issue of division of the matrimonial assets. At the outset, the parties indicated their positions to the court. The Wife was requesting for an award of 30% of the total matrimonial pool while the Husband wanted the matrimonial home to be transferred to him in consideration of his refunding to her CPF account all monies she had withdrawn for the matrimonial home.

18     The assets that fell within the matrimonial pool were largely undisputed. Apart from the matrimonial home which was a Housing Development Board Flat and a bank account which was jointly held, each party held monies in bank accounts, CPF monies and insurance policies. The values of all of these were undisputed. The Husband also owned a motor vehicle and while neither party disputed that this should fall within the matrimonial pool, they disputed the value. The Husband put forth the market value of the car of $97,562.66. Upon taking into consideration the outstanding hire purchase amount, he claimed a net value of $13,582.51. He also referred to an initial deposit amount which he had paid and claimed that there was still an amount of $1,389.59 outstanding[^3]. The Wife accepted the market value of $97,562 and the outstanding hire purchase amount of $13,582.51 but disputed that the further outstanding amount of $1,389.59. Upon examination of the evidence before me, I accepted the Wife’s position.

19     In addition to the above, the Husband wanted the Wife to account for a sum of $11,550. These were amounts that he claimed the Wife had withdrawn from the monies he had put into her accounts as maintenance between 2014 to September 2016. Firstly, I noted that these were payments made by the Husband to the Wife as maintenance payments. In the circumstances, I did not think it was reasonable to expect the Wife to account for monies she had not spent. Further, I noted that the marriage had not broken down at the time. I accordingly came to the conclusion that these were payments made in the course of the marriage. In light of this, I declined to add this back into the pool.

20     The table below sets out the assets within the matrimonial pool and their values:

## The legal principles on division of matrimonial property

21     The court is tasked with the duty to divide matrimonial assets in accordance with Section 112(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) which requires such division to take place “in such proportion as the court thinks just and equitable.”

22     The structured approach referred to in _ANJ v ANK_ \[2015\] 4 SLR 1043 was affirmed in the Court of Appeal case of _Twiss Christopher James Hans v Twiss, Yvonne Prendergast_ \[2015\] SGCA 52 and summarised into the following broad steps:

(a)     Express as a ratio the parties’ direct contributions relative to each other, having regard to the amount of the financial contribution each party made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets;

(b)     Express as a second ratio the parties’ indirect contributions relative to each other, having regard to both financial and non-financial contributions; and

(c)     Derive the parties’ overall contributions relative to each other.

## Direct Contributions

23     I started by assessing each spouse’s direct contributions to the jointly owned matrimonial assets.

#### Matrimonial property

24     The matrimonial property was a Housing Development Board Flat jointly owned by the parties. Apart from monies withdrawn from each parties’ respective CPF accounts, which was undisputed, the Husband claimed that he had contributed a sum of $33,511 for renovations and also a sum of $58,622 as cash ($30,813 as down payment and $12,283)4[^4]. Both these amounts were disputed by the Wife.

25     The Wife contended that renovations paid by the Husband only amounted to $22,148 as many of the items referred to in the Husband’s tabulation had included items which should be attributable to indirect financial contributions. Upon further consideration the Husband’s counsel agreed to the Wife’s position on the contributions in the form of renovations and I accepted that the Husband had contributed a sum of $22,158 for renovations.

26     With regard to the cash contributions, it was the Husband’s case that he had obtained a loan of $30,813.75 from his mother who had paid him by way of a cheque dated 1 June 2014. While the Husband provided a copy of the requisite cheque as well as an IOU from his mother, there was no evidence provided by the Husband which showed that this amount was paid by him towards the matrimonial property. Without any evidence in this regard, I was unable to accept the Husband’s assertions on the $30,813.75. The balance amount of $12,283 contributed in cash towards the property was not disputed by the Wife[^5] and accordingly I took this into consideration as part of the Husband’s contribution towards the matrimonial property. Tabulating each parties’ contributions as described above, I arrived at a direct contribution ratio towards the matrimonial home of 5:95 in favour of the Husband.

27     After factoring the assets held by each party in their own names as well as attributing half of the value of the joint bank account to each party, I determined that the Wife had made direct contributions of 18% towards the total matrimonial asset pool while the Husband had made direct contributions of 81%.

## Indirect Contributions

28     I now turn to the indirect contributions. The Wife argued that an appropriate ratio for indirect contributions was 60:40 in her favour while the Husband argued that the ratio for indirect contributions should be 80:20 in his favour.

29     I noted that this was a very short marriage of 3 years 5 months. From the start of the marriage, the parties lived separately and even when the child was born, for more than one year of the child’s life, the parties continued to reside separately. It was only in May 2016 when the parties moved in together. By November 2016 however the marriage had broken down and the Wife moved out.

30     With regard to indirect financial contributions, it was not disputed that at least until November 2016, the Husband made the bulk of all indirect financial contributions. The evidence showed that even after the marriage broke down, he continued to make contributions towards the child’s maintenance. This was also not disputed. Based on this, it would be safe to say that the Husband had made the majority share of the indirect financial contributions.

31     With regard to the indirect non-financial contributions, based on the information before me, it was evident that the Wife was the primary care giver of the child although she relied on her parents to support her. I noted however that he was not an uninvolved Husband, but had clearly been actively involved in the care of the child.

32     Taking all of the evidence before me into consideration as well as the submissions of the parties and especially bearing in mind the length of the marriage and considering both indirect and direct contributions and adopting a broad brush approach, I came to the conclusion that the parties had contributed equally in terms of indirect contributions. Accordingly, I attributed ratio of 50:50 between the parties.

## Just and Equitable Division and adjustments

33     I noted that this was a very short marriage and notwithstanding that there was a child, I considered that rather than applying the average of the 2 ratios, I was of the view that it would be appropriate for an adjustment to be made to the average ratio such that direct contributions should be given a weightage of 60% and the indirect contributions a weightage of 40%. Applying this, I determined that the matrimonial pool should be divided in the ratio of 69:31 in favour of the Wife. Neither party made submissions on adjustments to the final division ratio and bearing in mind my conclusion on the division of assets, I did not think that any adjustments were necessary After taking into consideration the assets held by each party in their own names, this amounted to a division of the matrimonial home in the ratio of 68:32 in favour of the Husband.

34     To give effect to my decision on division of the matrimonial pool, I granted to the Husband the first option to take over the matrimonial home in exchange for payment of a sum of $86,000. Should the Husband decide not to take over the matrimonial home, I made orders for the matrimonial home to be sold and the net sale proceeds divided in the ratio of 68:32 in favour of the Husband.

## Child’s Medical Expenses

35     As part of my maintenance orders, I made orders relating to the child’s medical expenses. As it was the Husband’s submission that he has insurance coverage for the child’s medical expenses, he had taken the position that there should be no amount attributable for the child’s medical. In this regard, it was his position that the Wife should just utilise his medical and dental coverage for the child and even offered to bear all amounts which fall outside the coverage. My orders took this into consideration.

## Conclusion

36     For all the above reasons, I formed the view that it would be in the best interests for the child to continue to reside with the Wife with liberal access to the Husband. As for the division of the matrimonial pool, taking into consideration all of the evidence before me, I arrived at what I considered to be a fair and equitable division of assets.
