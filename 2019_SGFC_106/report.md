Family law – Ancillary matters – shared care and control

24 September 2019

### District Judge Kathryn Thong:

## Introduction

1       This is the Mother’s appeal against the shared care and control orders I made in the ancillary matters hearing. These grounds thus focus squarely on this issue. The Mother believes she should have been granted sole care and control of parties’ only child, Damien, who was 3½ years old at the time of my decision. Both parties had sought sole care and control.

2       My orders for shared care and control was premised mainly on my findings that both parents had a healthy bond with Damien which ought to be further nurtured, and that both had their respective strengths in raising Damien, which ultimately would be in his best interests in the long run.

## Background

3       The Mother is a 39-year-old freelance piano teacher; the father a 42-year old banker. Parties married on 10 January 2009 and Damien was born in September 2015. A domestic helper was hired to assist the parties in July 2016. In September 2017, the Mother left the matrimonial home with Damien, and went to stay with her parents in their flat, where her sister also resides.

4       On 21 December 2017, parties entered into a consent order for the Father to pay a sum of $1,200 as Damien’s monthly maintenance with effect from January 2018, as well as to pay Damien’s school fees, medical and dental and “educational aids” costs. For the avoidance of doubt, Damien is not a special needs child; these “educational aids” were storybooks, percussion instruments; art supplies, stationery and the like which the Mother purchases for him.

5       On 16 January 2018, the Mother filed for divorce and on 28 March 2018, a consent order was recorded that parties would have joint custody of Damien. Further, the Father would drive Damien to school every morning, and have overnight, weekend access to Damien on alternating timings as follows: from 5pm on Saturdays to 7pm on Sunday, and then 10am on Sundays to Monday mornings when he alights Damien at school.

6       Since leaving the matrimonial home in September 2017, Damien’s routine was, according to the Mother, as follows:

7       During the proceedings, it was brought to this Court’s attention that there was an issue with the Father picking Damien up from school and not releasing Damien to the Mother. Suffice to say, I saw it appropriate at the time to make interim orders (pending my final decision) that only the Mother be allowed to send and pick Damien up from school from thereon. I was later given to understand from counsel that Damien was eventually returned to the Mother without further similar incident, though disagreement remained over handover timings and denial of make up access and such.

## Parties’ respective positions

8       Owing to the events at \[7\] above, the Mother sought sole custody of Damien thus departing from the consent order; she was content for the Father to continue to have overnight access over the weekend as per the consent order. Also, as Damien would soon be enrolled in a school nearer her parents’ home, the Mother stated she would be responsible for fetching Damien to and from school. The Father would no longer fetch Damien to school.

9       The Mother submitted that she had always been the primary, if not the sole caregiver of Damien, and had merely been assisted by the domestic helper with caring for Damien. She spoke of how she had seen Damien through his various milestones; how she engaged him in sensory play and brought him out to various places such as indoor trampoline activities, as he loves jumping.

10     In contrast, she claimed that the Father did not care for her or Damien when he was born, choosing to head to his friend’s house for the weekend instead of helping her out; how the Father had attended a water polo game without regard for her or Damien, leaving her to care for Damien when both mother and child were down with Hand, Foot and Mouth disease. She believed the Father would be unable to care for Damien and would end up delegating everything to the helper.

11     Also, the Mother was apparently trained in early childcare, and portrayed herself as being better-equipped than the Father in raising Damien. Some of the activities she engaged in were reading and music and movement based on a combination of Attachment Parenting, Resources for Infant Educators and Montessori principles. Before bedtime, she and Damien would either read a book or engage in developmental exercises (eg. music instrument play, sensory play) etcetera.

12     She added that Damien ’s toys, educational materials were generally bought by her and disapproved of the Father allowing Damien to choose his toys: “\[i\]f \[the Father\] does bring Damien to buy any toys, he would simply ask Damien to choose at the toy store. However, I will take the effort to choose what is good and what is not for Damien ’s development and stage.”

13     Beyond this, the Mother claimed that the Father denigrated her in public, causing Damien severe distress and humiliation. She feared that Damien would end up disrespecting people. She also alleged “erratic and abusive demeanour” of the Father, causing Damien to hide whenever the Father started shouting, and even waking up in tears. The Mother asserted in her affidavit of June 2018 that “\[i\]t has come to a point where Damien seems to be fearful of the Father.”

14     In addition, the Mother opined that the Father lacked the patience to coach Damien, “lashing” out at Damien when Damien was unable to carry out the Father’s instructions, telling Damien to “shut up” or “get out of \[his\] sight”. Such “heavy-handedness”, the Mother believed, would only cause Damien to “develop untowardly and in a negative fashion.”

15     The Father maintained his position on joint custody, but sought sole care and control of Damien, with overnight access to the Mother from Thursday evenings to Sunday mornings.

16     He submitted that the Mother had always been assisted by a domestic helper and would be unable to manage on her own. He cited instances of how she could not get Damien ready for school on time and exhibited photographs of Damien having to change out of his pyjamas; brush his teeth and eat his breakfast – all in the car – when the Father came to pick him up.

17     The Father also explained that he had flexible working hours such that he could be around in the afternoons to interact with Damien. Given that Damien already spends most of his weekdays in the matrimonial flat with the domestic helper, the Father believed that Damien was used to the helper and she could help look after Damien as well.

18     He also claimed that the Mother was unconcerned over Damien’s health and well-being, and cited how the Mother had failed to complete a course of medication for Damien’s viral infection, and had ignored the paediatrician’s instructions not to feed Damien dairy and cold food. A further incident was Damien being scratched by a cat which led to swelling of his right wrist. Instead of applying medication, the Mother had simply washed Damien’s wrist. It was only on the 10th day of the incident that the Father found out through the domestic helper that Damien had been scratched.

19     Finally, the Father averred that Damien was used to living in the matrimonial flat and that was an ideal environment for him to grow up in, unlike the Mother’s parents’ flat where it was relatively crowded.

## My decision

20     In proceedings concerning a child, it is trite that the paramount consideration is what is in the child’s best interests. The learned Debbie Ong J put is as such in _TAU v TAT_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHCF 11</span> (“_TAU v TAT_”):

> In making orders for custody, care and control, and access, the court’s focus is on the child’s welfare, which is the paramount consideration in all proceedings directly affecting the interests of a child: see s 3 of the GIA and s 125(2) of the Charter. This welfare principle ensures that the child’s interests are not side-lined while his or her parents litigate over what they subjectively perceive to be their respective rights and entitlements. It has been said elsewhere in Debbie Ong Siew Ling & Lim Hui Min, “Custody and Access: Caring or Controlling?” in _Developments in Singapore Law Between 2001 and 2005_ (Singapore Academy of Law, 2006) (Teo Keang Sood gen ed) ch 15 at p 581 that:

>> The child of separation and divorce needs to be cared for long after his/her parents have parted ways. \[Custody, care and control, and access\] are the constructs used by the court to make arrangements for who the child will live with, who he/she will visit, and who will have authority over \[him\]/her in matters great and small. _In this regard, \[custody, care and control, and access\] are instruments which allow the parents to continue caring for the child after the breakdown of their relationship. From another perspective, \[custody, care and control, and access\] are rights to be acquired, negotiated with, and even fought over in the elaborate aftermath of separation and divorce. They are a means employed to gain dominion over the child. Basely used, they can be instruments to control the activities of the other parent. A misguided sense of entitlement, unresolved anger, or a genuine and intolerable difference of opinion \[is\] all it takes to turn an instrument of care into an instrument of control. …_

21     The above extract in italics perfectly encapsulates the unfortunate reality that often follows the breakdown of a marriage with children.

22     In the present case, it appeared to me that it was more the differences in opinion and bitterness towards each other, that motivated both Mother and Father to seek sole care and control of Damien, and less because they had Damien’s best interests at heart. This was underscored not just by the various relatively trivial incidents parties hearkened to, but also by their shifting positions throughout the proceedings, such as the Mother asking for an increase in the $1,200 maintenance to $1,500 because the Father was trying to toilet train him by allegedly denying Damien access to diapers; the Mother seeking sole custody, and the Father seeking a reduction in Damien’s maintenance to a mere $300. There was also much unhappiness on the Father’s part as to his lack of access, where he viewed the Mother as dictating when he could see Damien which it seemed to me, spurred him towards a case for sole care and control.

23     I make the above observations not to cast either party in a negative light, but to highlight how acrimony between parties can obscure and blind parties to the crux of the matter, which is what would be most beneficial to Damien. Both parties’ arguments for sole care and control were fixated on tearing the other party down as an unfit and lousy parent, rather than focusing on how Damien would best thrive under their sole care.

24     Generally, I find that reference to past incidents of a parent not being as present or as helpful as he/she can be, are all too common and easy to harp on, particularly with the sting of ongoing divorce proceedings. Even if true, it does not necessarily mean that a parent is irresponsible or unfit. Likewise, differences in opinion as to how to treat a viral infection or a scratch, and even departing from a paediatrician’s directions, should not without more, result in a finding that a parent has been derelict. When a marriage breaks down, much of what a spouse did or failed to do, is viewed through a harsher lens.

25     That which is germane to answering what is in the child’s best interests, are matters such as the bond the child has with both parents, and how to preserve and promote that bond. After all, the natural state of affairs in an intact marriage, is for both parents to be living with the child and to be involved in his/her life. As was noted at \[12\] of _TAU v TAT_:

> The ideal state is understandably for a child to be in an intact family where he or she lives with and is lovingly cared for jointly by both parents. Yet, upon the breakdown of a marriage, this is simply no longer fully achievable. The family justice system nevertheless aspires to achieve the ideal state of affairs for the child, or the closest to it possible.

26     Of concern to me was the Mother’s allegations that Damien was fearful of the Father. In the course of the proceedings, the Mother tendered a report from an art therapist, who stated her observations that Damien “experienced separation anxiety and showed reluctance to leave his Mother’s side.” He also displayed “attention-seeking behaviour” that often elicited a response from the Mother. The therapist suggested that “this could be driven by the need for assurance, care and concern, which might be contributed by an insecure attachment pattern”.

27     The art therapist also noted that Damien “experienced hyperactivity as evidenced by a high energy level, restlessness and difficulty sitting still”. She opined that Damien would “benefit from increased participation in other physical activities that would allow him to expand and utilize excess energy…\[and\] recommended for there to be some form of structure, consistency and predictability in the routines of his life to instil a sense of safety and security.”

28     This report was – for reasons best known to the Mother – obtained after counsel first appeared before me in January 2019, and after I had directed for a custody evaluation report (“CER”) to be prepared. The therapy session apparently took place on 11 February 2019 and it seemed there had only been 1 session thus far. This report was relied on at the case conference where Ms \[C\], counsel for the Mother, sought for interim orders to be made arising from Damien not being returned to the Mother’s care (see \[7\] above).

29     Nowhere in the report was it mentioned that Damien was traumatised or in fear of the Father. At first blush, the Mother’s claims that Damien was fearful of the Father appeared unsupported. Expectedly, the Father vehemently denied the allegations and stated that Damien was happy in his interactions with him.

30     It was significant that the Father had been sending Damien to school every morning since the Mother left the matrimonial home. That the Mother agreed for the Father to drive Damien to school every morning, and was comfortable enough for the Father to have overnight access, strongly suggested that she did not believe it would be injurious to Damien to be with the Father for an extended period of time, and undermined her claim that Damien was fearful of the Father.

31     In fact, in fetching Damien to school every day, the Father would drive from the matrimonial home in Commonwealth to Jurong West where Damien resided with his grandparents, then to Damien ’s school in Bukit Timah, before the Father headed for work. This was by no means a short commute, and the effort demonstrated the Father’s desire to spend time with Damien, and also that the Mother was comfortable leaving Damien in the Father’s care for this period.

32     Further, the Father had flexible working hours which was confirmed by the Mother in this hearing (in the context of seeking the increased maintenance). This meant that the Father had the capacity to spend more time with Damien, and he suggested that his weekday afternoons could be spent with him. His continual frustration over being unable to see Damien when he wished to, was palpable in evidence, and it was clear that he wished to see more of his son.

33     While the Mother expressed concern that the Father having care and control would mean that Damien would be left alone with the domestic helper on weekdays, this concern was somewhat illusory. First, the Mother had already accepted that the Father had flexible working hours and he had indicated he wished to spend his afternoons with Damien. Second, the existing reality was that Damien was already being left alone with the domestic helper when he got dropped off at the matrimonial home after school. With the Father’s flexible working hours, he could be around at home and could care for Damien, assisted by the helper. Even if he had no such flexibility, it would not be a change from the current situation. Whilst the Mother made reference to her mother and aunties helping to look after Damien, she did not propose such a care plan in her affidavits. It was more likely than not that such an arrangement was not readily available, which is why she resorted to leaving Damien at the matrimonial home after school.

34     As I adverted to earlier, it was the disagreement in parenting styles and personal acrimony that likely motivated parties to respectively seek sole care and control. For instance, while the Mother would pick out Damien ’s toys to ensure they were “good” based on his developmental stage, and criticised the Father for allowing Damien to choose his own toys, the Father’s belief was that giving Damien autonomy in this regard, would “broaden his horizons”. He felt that “\[we\] should not take the joy away from him to choose his own toys.”

35     And while the Mother noted Damien ’s obsession with the alphabet, the Father explained that being a sportsman, he believed that being active in sports would equip Damien with important life skills, and had friends who could “start Damien off on the right note”. However, he claimed he was being denied such opportunities by the Mother, which was why Damien was obsessed with his alphabets and “nothing else”, and had minimal social interaction in school.

36     I found that there was nothing inherently wrong in parties’ respective parenting strategies. Ordinarily, in a functioning marriage, one may even look upon these divergent approaches as being complementary and beneficial. Regrettably, in divorces, it often proves to be a wellspring of conflict.

37     As a young boy, it was in my view important for Damien to have an abiding, male presence in his life. There was nothing in the Mother’s affidavits that persuaded me that the Father was not suited to care for Damien. In fact, the Father’s predilection for sports was beneficial for Damien – physical activities for him to expend excess energy, was precisely what the art therapist had recommended. The Father also could not be faulted for wanting to give Damien freedom of choice when it came to his toys. As the Father acknowledged, as parents, they would choose good toys for Damien, but as a young boy, Damien would also derive joy from making his own choices in this respect.

38     The CER reinforced my views as to the Father’s relationship with Damien. It was reported that Damien was happy spending individual time with both the Mother and the Father. It was also observed that Damien had “sufficiently close bonds” with the Father, notwithstanding the limited interactions with him.

39     The significance of this is two-fold. First, it was clear that Damien has a healthy bond with the Father, and was happy being in his father’s company. Second, it was noteworthy that this bond remained close despite the Father having had limited time with Damien since the Mother left the matrimonial home. This pointed towards the father and son relationship having a firm foundation which remain largely unaffected by Damien ’s departure from the family home, and concurrently pointed towards a likelihood of the father-son relationship strengthening if more time could be afforded to the Father to do so.

40      _TAU v TAT_ has made it clear that there is no presumption of shared care and control being in the child’s welfare. At \[12\] of _TAU v TAT_, the learned Ong J cautioned that whilst the Court tries to achieve the ideal state (see \[25\] above),

> …But to ignore the realities, including the parental conflict, the parties’ emotional baggage and the new dynamics of the various relationships, and impose in all situations a modified version of the perceived ideal (such as equal-time shared parenting or shared care and control) can do more harm than good. Thus in considering whether shared care and control would be in the child’s welfare, the court will have to consider factors such as that particular child’s needs at that stage of life, the extent to which the parents are able to co-operate within such an arrangement, and whether it is easy for that child, bearing in mind his or her age and personality, to live in two homes within one week.

41     Damien was 3 ½ years old at the time I rendered my decision. He had been observed to be insecure and there was a need for predictability and routine in his life. It would have been facile to grant the Mother sole care and control given the very strong bond he has with the Mother. But I did not think that would be in Damien ’s best interests.

42     The solution to Damien ’s separation anxiety in my view, and what would be optimal for his development, was for him to recognise that there were people other than the Mother, who love and care for him, and that he can feel secure in their presence. He would do well to be surrounded by such people. The Father, someone whom Damien had a close bond with, and whose company Damien was happy to be in, was the natural and in my view, best person to help fulfil that role.

43     In _ABW v ABV_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 769</span> (“_ABW v ABV_”), the learned Judith Prakash J (as she then was) referring to _Soon Peck Wah v Woon Che Chye_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 3 SLR(R) 430</span>, observed that “\[It\] is important to maintain the ties of affection the child enjoys.” She went on to point out at \[25\] that:

> …The courts have observed that a child who understands that both his parents have custody of him and continue to be involved in his life is likely to feel more secure and that the same surely applies to access orders as well (see _BG v BF_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 3 SLR(R) 233</span> at \[13\]). In the same judgment, Andrew Ang J noted that as far as possible, “a child should be allowed to interact with both “a child should be allowed to interact with both parents, so that despite the breakdown in relations between the parents, he is assured, to the greatest extent possible, of a normal family life with two parents”.

44     In _AHJ v AHK_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGHC 148</span>, the learned Tay J (as he then was) ordered shared care and control, his rationale being as follows:

> Bearing in mind that the son is only four years old, it will be in his interest to have the care and influence of both parents as much as possible. Both parents love the son and both want him…There is no indication that one or the other party is a much better parent or that one home environment is much more conducive for the son’s development than the other. The only logical solution is to let the parties have more or less equal time with the son so that he can benefit from the love of both, while ensuring that his attendance at the pre-school centre is not disrupted.

45     It is apparent that Damien is very close to the Mother. But he also has a healthy bond with the Father and is happy being in his presence. It is vital that he feels secure and has a father figure in his life, particularly when he had yet to overcome his separation anxiety. Nothing in the art therapist’s report or the CER pointed towards the Father being the cause of Damien ’s insecurity, and if it was the parental conflict that contributed towards it, then a shared care and control order would potentially minimise such conflict. In fact, the CER observed that parties already had minimal communication with each other save for when they were quarrelling over access and misunderstood each other’s intentions. At this stage of Damien ’s life, it was unlikely that parties needed to cooperate extensively. Damien has not yet commenced formal schooling and issues such as leaving one’s school books behind in one home, does not yet rear its head. The matrimonial home, was an environment which the Mother accepted, was comfortable for Damien, as was her parents’ place. There was much that the Father had to offer in raising Damien, and the Father’s parents loved Damien too, and they were observed to have sufficiently bonded with Damien. The Mother’s offer of overnight weekend access, was not sufficient in my view to promote the strengthening of the father-son bond, and would deprive Damien of reaping the full benefits of family life.

46     Harking to _TAU v TAT_, Ong J remarked at \[20\] that

> Where such an arrangement \[of shared care and control\] is suitable for a child in his or her developmental stage of life, considering his or her relationship with each parent and all relevant circumstances, such an order may be made for the child’s welfare. Whatever the arrangements ultimately made, parents must recognise that they must “_place the needs of their children before their own_”: _TAA v TAB_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 2 SLR 879</span> at \[18\]. \[own emphasis\]

47     It cannot be emphasised more that the abiding presence of both parents in the child’s life is crucial to any child’s development. In the present case, neither party appeared to fully appreciate this fact of life. Rather than acknowledge the other party’s positive attributes in caring for Damien, both parties were disdainful of each other and thought the other could not do without the helper. Harping on historical events of a trifling nature, or which are exaggerated or given a sinister spin through the divorce, does not assist the Court in determining what is in the best interests of the child and in my view, very often clouds the judgment of parties such that their resentment of each other makes them unable to focus on what Damien truly needs of them.

48     “Plac\[ing\] the needs of children before their own” is not only about the obvious or overt sacrifices parents make such as forgoing a lucrative overseas posting (which was the context in _TAA v TAB_). It also refers to less apparent, and perhaps, more profound acts of putting aside one’s anger, pride or sense of superiority, to allow the child to benefit from the love and care of the other parent, even if it goes against the grain – because the child’s welfare is paramount.

### Conclusion

49     For the reasons above, I ordered joint custody and shared care and control of Damien to parties. The Father would have care and control of Damien from Sundays, 10 am to Wednesday morning when Damien is dropped off at school. To reduce occasion for conflict, I ordered that handovers and drop offs would take place at the Plaintiff’s void deck, in the presence of a trusted third party such as a domestic helper or grandparent. There will be a review of the care and control orders in a year’s time and in the meantime, parties were to attend counselling at the DSSA.
