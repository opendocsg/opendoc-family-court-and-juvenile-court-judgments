Family Law – variation of maintenance payable; enforcement of maintenance payable

13 June 2019

### District Judge Christine Lee:

### Introduction

1       Both of the appeals in this case are by the Appellant Father against the whole of the Court’s decisions in the two Court Orders made on 7th March 2019 regarding the maintenance payable by the Appellant to the Respondent Mother for the Respondent and their two children.

2       This appeal is closely connected with a previous appeal also filed by the Appellant Father in DCA 100 of 2018 on 21st September 2018, the hearing of which has not yet been completed for the reasons set out in paragraphs 26 to 28 below.

### Background Facts

3       The Appellant Father (“Appellant”) and Respondent Mother (“Respondent”) married in India on 11th May 2005. They moved to Singapore in 2006 after their first child was born. The Parties returned to India in 2008 where their second child was born in 2009 and then returned to Singapore in 2009 with the two children. In the meanwhile, the Appellant obtained Singapore Permanent Residency in 2007. However, the Respondent’s continued stay in Singapore was based on a Long Term Visit Pass.

4       The two children from this marriage are, XXX (f) DOB: XXX now aged 13 years and XXX (m) DOB: XXX now aged 9+ years (“the 2 children”) who were on Student Passes for the duration of their stay in Singapore.

### Prior Maintenance Applications

5       On 27th January 2014, a consent order was recorded in MSS 5949 of 2013 for the Appellant to pay the sum of $1,000 as monthly maintenance for the Respondent with effect from 15th February 2014 and thereafter on the 15th day of each month. The Appellant was also to solely bear the 2 children’s school fees and all school-related expenses including year-end expenses.

6       Another Court Order was made in MSS 839 of 2014 dated 4th April 2014, whereby the Appellant was also ordered to pay the sum of $1,000 as monthly maintenance for the 2 children with effect from 30th April 2014 and thereafter on the last day of each month.

7       By way of a further Court Order made in MSS 1724 of 2014 dated 1st August 2014, the monthly maintenance payable by the Appellant for the 2 children was increased from $1,000 to $1,900 with effect from 31st July 2014 and thereafter on the last day of each month. Thus, from the end of July 2014, the Appellant was to pay the total sum of $2,900 per month for the maintenance of the Respondent (at $1,000) and the 2 children (at $1,900).

8       In the meanwhile, in February 2014, the Respondent moved out of the matrimonial home with the 2 children to a shelter. On 11th April 2014, the Appellant filed OSF 204 of 2014, to seek sole custody, care and control of the 2 children. On 16th May 2014, the Respondent made a cross application in OSF 272 of 2014, also seeking sole custody, care and control of the 2 children.

9       By way of an Order of Court dated 24th October 2014, the Parties were granted joint custody of the 2 children but care and control was awarded to the Respondent and the Appellant was granted unsupervised access to the 2 children. No appeal was made against this Court Order.

10     However, on 23rd March 2015, the Appellant filed OSG 55 of 2015, to seek a variation of the 24th October 2014 Court Order, for the reversal of the award of care and control of the 2 children from the Respondent to the Appellant and for the maintenance costs of the 2 children to be borne by him. The Appellant’s variation application in OSG 55 of 2015 was dismissed on 8th October 2015.

11     The Appellant appealed against this order in DCA 196 of 2015 which was filed on 7th December 2015. This appeal was dismissed on 16th December 2016.

12     On 25th November 2015, the Appellant filed an application in MSS 5084 of 2015 for a downward variation of the monthly maintenance payable by him (“the said monthly maintenance”) of the total sum of $2,900 for the Respondent and 2 children under the Court Orders made in 2014. The Respondent also filed a cross application in MSS 5249 of 2015 on 7th December 2015 for an upward variation of the said monthly maintenance.

13     The Appellant’s and Respondent’s cross maintenance applications were heard on 11th February 2016 and 19th February 2016 whereupon the learned District Judge dismissed both applications on 19th February 2016. The Appellant appealed against this decision on 24th February 2016 in DCA 32 of 2016 which appeal was also dismissed on 16th December 2016.

### Prior Maintenance Orders related to the current appeals

14     On 30th June 2016, the Appellant filed MSS 2706 of 2016, for another variation of the said monthly maintenance payable by the Appellant. On 11th July 2016, the Respondent cross applied in MSS 2859 of 2016 and MSS 2860 of 2016, for enforcement of the outstanding arrears of the said monthly maintenance payable by the Appellant.

15     At the conclusion of the hearing of these three cross applications, the learned District Judge made orders on 25th August 2016 regarding the outstanding arrears owed by the Appellant to the Respondent and also ordered that the Appellant continue to pay the said monthly maintenance sum of $2,900, and that the Appellant was to solely bear only the said 2 children’s school fees and year-end expenses with effect from September 2016. These orders were issued in VO368/2016 (“the 25th August 2016 Court Order”). The Appellant did not appeal against this Court Order.

16     On 6th January 2017, the Respondent filed an application in MSS 106 of 2017 for enforcement of the 25th August 2016 Court Order against the Appellant. At the conclusion of this hearing, the learned District Judge issued a Court Order dated 8th March 2017 in EMO 346/2017, reiterating that the Appellant should continue to pay the said monthly maintenance sum of $2,900 together with instalment payments of $200 per month towards the outstanding arrears. The Appellant did not appeal against this Court Order.

17     On 3rd May 2017 in MSS 1781 of 2017, the Respondent filed a second application for the enforcement of the 25th August 2016 Court Order against the Appellant. On 9th June 2017, the Appellant filed a cross application in SUM 1960 of 2017, to seek a suspension of the said monthly maintenance for a period of six months. The basis for this application was that the Appellant had lost his job on 4th May 2017 and he was therefore unable to comply with the 25th August 2016 Court Order.

18     This Court dealt with both applications and issued two separate Court Orders dated 25th September 2017. For the Respondent’s enforcement application in MSS 1781 of 2017, this Court ordered that the Appellant was to pay the outstanding arrears in the sum of $9,700 as at September 2017, in four instalments with four show payment dates. The Appellant did not appeal against this Court Order and paid up all four instalment payments.

19     For the Appellant’s cross application in SUM 1960 of 2017, this Court granted the Appellants’ application for a variation of the 25th August 2016 Court Order, by suspending the payment of the said monthly maintenance for a period of six months i.e. from July 2017 to December 2017. The Appellant was to continue to pay for the 2 children’s school fees and year-end expenses. No appeal was made against this Order.

20     However, after the conclusion of this suspension period, on 7th February 2018 the Respondent filed another enforcement application in MSS 523 of 2018 regarding the said monthly maintenance payable by the Appellant. Under this application, a Court Order was issued in EMO 581/2018 dated 27th April 2018, for the Appellant to pay the sum of $8,900 comprising the outstanding arrears of the said monthly maintenance for three months (January, February and March 2018) at $2,900 per month in addition to the previous outstanding instalment payments due under the 25th August 2016 Court Order.

21     The Appellant was thereby ordered to make instalment payments of $100 per month with effect from 30th April 2018 and thereafter on the last day of each month until this sum of $8,900 was fully paid up on top of the current said monthly maintenance of the sum of $2,900. The Appellant did not appeal against this Court Order.

22     On 2nd May 2018, the Respondent filed another enforcement application in MSS 1628 of 2018 regarding the said monthly maintenance payable by the Appellant. On 22nd June 2018, the learned District Judge ordered that the Appellant was to pay the sum of $6,200 comprising the outstanding arrears of the maintenance for the two months (April and May 2018) at $2,900 per month in addition to the previous outstanding instalment payments due under the 25th August 2016 Court Order. The total outstanding sum of $6,200 was to paid in 4 equal monthly instalments of $1,550 in default of which the Appellant was to serve one-day imprisonment for each non-payment[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1).

23     The Appellant appealed against this order in DCA 61 of 2018 and the Grounds of Decision was issued by the learned District Judge on 8th August 2018. However, this appeal was subsequently withdrawn by the Appellant on 11th September 2018 and the Appellant fully paid up the outstanding arrears[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2).

### Appeal in DCA 100 of 2018

24     Between February 2018 and June 2018, the Appellant filed four (4) Summons applications namely, SUM 744 of 2018, SUM 891 of 2018, SUM 1123 of 2018 and SUM 2105 of 2018. These were for orders again seeking the reversal of care and control of the 2 children from the Respondent to the Appellant; to reduce the said monthly maintenance payable by the Appellant; for committal of the Respondent in denying the Appellant access to the 2 children and to grant the Appellant an order to authorise the Appellant to withdraw the 2 children out of school.

25     On 10th September 2018, this Court made orders regarding all 4 Summons applications by the Appellant. In the Court Order dated 10th September 2018, this Court partly allowed the Appellant’s application in SUM 891 of 2018, by granting a reduction of the said monthly maintenance payable by the Appellant from the sum of $2,900 per month, to $1,800 per month, being $910 for the Respondent and $890 for the 2 children, with effect from 1st July 2018.

26     On 21st September 2018, the Appellant filed an appeal in DCA 100 of 2018 against the Court Order issued on 10th September 2018 regarding three of these 4 Summons applications. The Grounds of Decision for that appeal (in DCA 100 of 2018) was duly issued on 21st December 2018. However, the Appellant failed to submit his Record of Appeal, Core Bundle and Appellant’s Case (“the Appellant’s Appeal Papers”) by the due date of 25th January 2019 and the appeal was deemed to be withdrawn.

27     On 7th March 2019, the Appellant appeared in person and was granted an extension of time to file the Appellant’s Appeal Papers by 13th March 2019 with the next pre-trial conference fixed for 16th April 2019. The Appellant duly filed the Appellant’s Appeal Papers on 15th March 2019. However, at the pre-trial conference on 16th April 2019, neither the Appellant nor the Respondent were present.

28     Accordingly, the Appellant’s appeal in DCA 100 of 2018 was struck off. The Appellant subsequently instructed solicitors who filed a Notice of Appointment of Solicitor on 2nd May 2019 for this appeal. However, no application for the reinstatement of the Appellant’s appeal in DCA 100 of 2018 has been made as at the time of the issuance of these Grounds of Decision for the current appeals.

### Relevant Maintenance Orders regarding the current appeals

29     In the meanwhile, on 15th October 2018, the Respondent filed two more enforcement applications in MSS 3777 of 2018 and MSS 3778 of 2018 regarding the said monthly maintenance payable by the Appellant for the month of June 2018 and the reduced monthly maintenance payable by the Appellant thereafter. In addition, the Respondent filed an application in SUM 151 of 2018 for a variation of the Court Order dated 10th September 2018 regarding the relocation of the 2 children back to India under SUM 744 of 2018.

30     At the same time, on 13th December 2018, the Appellant also filed another application in SUM 4407 of 2018 to further vary the monthly maintenance payable by the Appellant in the reduced amount in the sum of $1,800 per month as granted in the Court Order issued on 10th September 2018 regarding SUM 891 of 2018.

31     Prior to the hearing of these applications, it was discovered that whilst the substance of the Court Order issued on 10th September 2018 was not affected, the process of the Appellant’s original application under SUM 891 of 2018 for the reduction of the said monthly maintenance payable by him, was incorrect and required rectification.

32     This Court informed both the Appellant and the Respondent of this procedural issue at the first hearing date on 9th January 2019 and the rectification was made by the filing of a complaint by the Appellant in MSS 110 of 2019 dated 9th January 2019 and the issuance of a Court Order in VO (MO) 110/2019 also of the same date. The substance of this Court Order was therefore, the same as that portion of the previous Court Order dated 10th September 2018 regarding SUM 891 of 2018. The Court Order dated 10th September 2018 was accordingly re-issued as revised on this date.

33     Thus at the next hearing day on 30th January 2019, there were three MSS applications and two Summons applications fixed before this Court as follows:

a.     enforcement application by the Respondent in **MSS 3777 of 2018** with regard to the Order of Court dated 27th April 2018;

b.     enforcement application by the Respondent in **MSS 3778 of 2018** with regard to the portion of the Court Order dated 10th September 2018 for SUM 891 of 2018;

c.     application by the Appellant in **SUM 4407 of 2018** for variation of the reduced maintenance payable under the Court Order dated 10th September 2018;

d.     application by the Appellant in **MSS 112 of 2019** to vary and/or rescind the maintenance payable under the Order of Court in VO (MO) 10/2019 dated 9th January 2019; and

e.     application by the Respondent in **SUM 151 of 2019** for variation of the Order of Court dated 10th September 2018 regarding SUM 744 of 2018 on the Appellant’s application for the relocation of the 2 children back to India.

34     At the outset, the Court noted that SUM 4407 of 2018 had been made redundant by the Appellant’s application in MSS 112 of 2019 and the Appellant agreed to withdraw this summons application and to only proceed with MSS 112 of 2019.

35     In addition, the Court noted that MSS 3778 of 2018 had also been made redundant because the Court Order regarding SUM 891 of 2018 had been replaced by VO (MO) 10/2019. The Respondent therefore also withdrew this MSS application and proceeded only with MSS 3777 of 2018 for the totality of her enforcement application against the Appellant.

### Hearings before the Court

36     As such, this Court proceeded with the concurrent hearing of the two MSS applications in MSS 3777 of 2018 (Respondent’s application for enforcement) and MSS 112 of 2019 (Appellant’s application for further variation) and the Respondent’s application in SUM 151 of 2019 regarding the portion of the Court Order dated 10th September 2018 for SUM 744 of 2018.

37     Following which, this Court issued two Court Orders both dated 7th March 2019, which orders are the subject matter of the current appeals in DCA 25 of 2019 and DCA 26 of 2019 by the Appellant (“the 2 Appeal Court Orders”).

### The Current Appeals

38     The Appellant is appealing against the whole of the two Court Orders issued on 7th March 2019 in EMO 332/2019 for MSS 3777 of 2018 and VO (MO-RO) 17/2019 for MSS 112 of 2019. The relevant portions of these two Court Orders are set out below.

For MSS 3777 of 2018 (Appeal in DCA 25 of 2019)

1.     \[The Appellant\] is to pay to \[the Respondent\] arrears in the sum of $30,716 as at 7th March 2019 (excluding maintenance for the month of March 2019), in instalment payments of $2,559 on or before the last day of each month with effect from 31st March 2019;

2.     This sum of $30,716 comprises the following:

a.       Maintenance in the sum of $2,900 (for June 2018);

b.       Maintenance for 5 months at $1,800 per month from July 2018 to Nov 2018 in the total sum of $9,000;

c.       Maintenance for 3 months at $1,000 per month (being $400 for \[the Respondent\] and $600 for the 2 children) from December 2018 to February 2019 in the total sum of $3,000;

d.       The balance of arrears under EMO 581/2018 \[Court Order dated 27th April 2018\] in the total sum of $7,600 (being the sum of $8,000 less the $400 paid by \[the Appellant\] in October 2018 and in January/February 2019);

e.       The school fees being claimed by \[the Respondent\] under the 25th August 2016 Court Order in VO 368/2016 in the sum of $8,216; and

f.       The total sum of $30,716 is to be paid by \[the Appellant\] in 12 instalments of $2,559 each.

3.     \[The Appellant\] is to show payment on 6 show payment dates being 1st April 2019, 2nd May 2019, 3rd June 2019, 1st July 2019, 1st August 2019 and 2nd September 2019.

4.     In the event that \[the Appellant\] defaults in making any of these 6 show payments, \[the Appellant\] is to serve 3 days’ imprisonment for each non-payment.

For MSS 112 of 2019 (Appeal in DCA 26 of 2019)

5.     The Maintenance Order in VO (MO) 10/2019 dated 9th January 2019 is to be varied with effect from 7th March 2019 as follows:

\[The Appellant\] shall pay the sum of $1,000 maintenance per month (being $400 for \[the Respondent\] and $600 for the 2 children) with effect from 31st December 2018 and thereafter on the last day of each month until varied or discharged according to law.

### Summary of the Court’s reasons for making its Orders

39     The Court dealt with the Appellant’s application in MSS 112 of 2019 first as this decision would affect the final order with regard to the Respondent’s enforcement application in MSS 3777 of 2018.

40     The Court noted that the Appellant’s original application was to rescind the Order of Court made on 10th September 2018 with regard to SUM 891 of 2018 on the maintenance payable by him. This portion of the Court Order dated 10th September 2018 was replaced by VO (MO)10/2019 dated 9th January 2019.

41     Under VO (MO) 10/2019 dated 9th January 2019, the Appellant’s variation application under SUM 891 of 2018 had been partially allowed to the extent that the monthly maintenance payable by the Appellant under the 25th August 2016 Court Order in VO 368/2016 was reduced from $2,900 per month to $1,800 per month.

42     This reduced amount of $1,800 per month was to take effect from 1st July 2018 and comprised of $910 for the Respondent and $890 for the 2 children. This reduced maintenance is also part of the Appellant’s appeal in DCA 100 of 2018, which, at the date of the issuance of these grounds, has not yet been re-instated. The procedural defect was also not known at the time of the issuance of the Grounds of Decision in DCA 100 of 2018.

43     For the purposes of completeness, the Court’s reasons for partially allowing the Appellant’s application under SUM 891 of 2018 by reducing the said monthly maintenance payable by the Appellant from $2,900 to $1,800 for the Respondent and the 2 children was primarily based on the fact that the Respondent’s and 2 children’s circumstances had changed[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3) and their expenses had been reduced since July 2018.

44     At the same time, the Court had re-assessed their monthly expenses as follows:

1.     Maintenance for elder child assessed at $460 per month. This comprised

a.       Transport for school (at $5 per day x 20days) = $100

b.       Transport for weekend (at $10 per weekend) = $40

c.       Allowance (at $10 per day x 20 days) = $200

d.       Books and Stationary = $30

e.       Mobile phone = $40

f.       Clothing & Miscellaneous = $50

Total is $460 (Note that food and groceries is covered under the Respondent’s expenses listed below).

2.     Maintenance for younger child assessed at $430 per month. This comprised:

a.       Transport for school (at $5 per day x 20days) = $100

b.       Transport for weekend (at $10 per weekend) = $40

c.       Allowance (at $10 per day x 20 days) = $200

d.       Books and Stationary = $50

e.       Clothing & Miscellaneous = $40

Total is $430

3.     From the Respondent’s list of expenses, the Court assessed that the following expenses were reasonable:

a.       Rental at $156 per month

b.       Telephone and Cable/TV/Internet at $100 per month

c.       Food & Groceries & Eating Out at $500 per month (including for both children)

d.       Miscellaneous expenses covering Medical and such like at $50 per month

e.       Transport at $100 per month

Total is $906 per month

4.     $460 + $430 + $906 = $1,796 which was rounded to $1,800 per month to take effect from 1st July 2018, after the Respondent and 2 children had moved to the shelter.

45     However, at the hearing, the Appellant revised his application in his written submissions, which was marked as Exhibit R5 wherein he asked (i) for a suspension of the maintenance payable by him from June 2018 to October 2018 as he was unemployed for these months (ii) to fix the maintenance payable from November 2018 to March 2019 based on his then take home salary of S$1,600 as well as the Respondent’s potential earnings in India which he assessed at 10,000 Rupees per month and (iii) to fix the monthly maintenance payable by him from April 2019 onwards to be based on the Appellant’s new job salary in India of 22,000 Rupees or approximately S$400 per month.

46     The Court was of the view that the first part of the Appellant’s application for the suspension of the June 2018 maintenance, had already considered by the Court when the Court made its decision on 10th September 2018, following which the Court had reduced the said monthly maintenance payable by the Appellant to $1,800 per month.

47     The Court was not convinced that the Appellant had no access to funds during the relevant period. This was because, during the course of the current appeal hearings, it was revealed that the Appellant had received a termination package amounting to nearly $70,000 in May 2017 but had only used a small portion of these monies (in the sum of $9,700) to make payment of the monthly maintenance arrears that he had been ordered to pay (see paragraph 18 above).

48     In addition, the Appellant failed to disclose that he had received this termination package to the Court when the 25th September 2017 Court Order was made (see paragraph 19 above). Hence, the Court granted the Appellant’s earlier application for a suspension of the maintenance payable by him for six months from July 2017 to December 2017. The Appellant also subsequently confirmed that he had paid up all outstanding maintenance payments for 2017.

49     The Court also noted that the Appellant had not challenged the enforcement proceedings filed against him by the Respondent for the monthly maintenance payable by him from January 2018 to March 2018 being the total arrears in the sum of $8,900 as at 27th April 2018. This was based on the said monthly maintenance in the sum of $2,900.

50     The Court further noted that whilst the Appellant had appealed against the Respondent’s enforcement proceedings against him for the maintenance payable by him from April to May 2018 in the sum of $6,200 as at 22 June 2018, this appeal was withdrawn on 11 September 2018. The Appellant also paid up the full amount of these arrears (see paragraph 23 above). These arrears were also based on the said monthly maintenance of $2,900 even though the Appellant submitted that he had no funds as he had lost his job in May 2017.

51     This reinforced the Court’s assessment that the Appellant had access to funds when he needed to raise money. The Court was therefore of the view that the Appellant had not provided any new or additional evidence to the Court to warrant any change of its decision and ordered that the amount of maintenance payable for the month of June 2018 should stand at $2,900.

52     Therefore, for the first part of the Appellant’s application, the Court was of the view that this issue had also been considered when the Court made its decision on 10th September 2018. That was precisely why the Court had reduced the maintenance payable by the Appellant from $2,900 to $1,800 per month with effect from July 2018.

53     However, for the second and third parts of the Appellant’s application in MSS 112 of 2019, the new evidence that the Court considered to be relevant was that the Respondent and the 2 children had relocated back to India in compliance with the Court Order regarding SUM 744 of 2018 as revised under the Respondent’s application in SUM 151 of 2019. The Court accepted that the cost of living expenses in India are less than in Singapore.

54     As to the amount of reduced maintenance that was to be payable by the Appellant, the Court took into account the Respondent’s list of estimated expenses in India as produced in Exhibit C7 on the fair and reasonable amount of maintenance to be assessed for the 2 children. In addition, the Court was of the view that it would not be appropriate to take into account the Appellant’s estimate of the Respondent’s potential earnings of 10,000 Rupees per month[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4) when there was no evidence to show that the Respondent had been able to obtain any employment on her return to India in December 2018.

55     In addition, the Court was of the view that Appellant’s submission that he was only capable of earning a monthly salary of 22,000 Rupees (approximately S$400 per month) in India[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5) was inconsistent with the Appellant’s capacity to earn more based on his qualifications. In this regard, the Court noted that the Appellant had been earning an approximate salary of S$11,000 per month in Singapore[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6) until he lost his job in May 2017.

56     Accordingly, the Court assessed that the Appellant should pay the further reduced monthly maintenance sum of $1,000 (being $400 for the Respondent and $600 ($300 each) for the 2 children) with effect from December 2018 to February 2019 with regard to the Respondent’s enforcement application in MSS 3777 of 2018.

57     With regard to the 2 children’s school fees payable by the Appellant, the Court noted that the Appellant had challenged this payment on the basis that he was only supposed to pay to the school directly and not to the Respondent. Although the Court directed the Appellant’s attention to Clause 2 of the 25th August 2016 Court Order in VO 368/2016 on his liability to pay, which read: “_In addition, \[the Appellant\] shall solely bear only the children’s school fees and year end expenses with effect from September 2016_”, the Appellant insisted that the learned District Judge had only intended for him to pay the fees to the school directly[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7) and not to the Respondent.

58     After having assessed the veracity of the Respondent’s credibility in relation to her testimony and the documents which she had produced during the hearings, the Court was of the view that there was no merit in the Appellant’s submission for him to not reimburse the payment of the 2 children’s school fees to the Respondent.

59     Therefore, the Court made its order in MSS 3777 of 2018 based on the reduced maintenance amounts payable by the Appellant as explained above, as well as the school fees claimed by the Respondent in the assessed sum of $8,216 and the balance of the outstanding arrears under EMO 581/2018 of the Court Order dated 27th April 2018.

### Conclusion

60     The case that was presented before the Court was not a straightforward one. This matter was complicated by the extremely acrimonious relationship between the Parties which had led to the multiple variation applications by the Appellant and the multiple enforcement applications by the Respondent.

61     The hearing of this case was further complicated by the status of the Appellant’s appeal in DCA 100 of 2018. The Court is of the view that if this appeal is re-instated, there is merit for the three appeals being, the Appellant’s appeals in DCA 100 of 2018 and in DCA 25 and DCA 26 of 2019, to be dealt with together.
