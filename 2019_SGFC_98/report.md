Family Law – Care and Control – Access – Maintenance – children – wife

Family Law – Relocation – children

17 September 2019

### District Judge Wong Keen Onn:

## Introduction

1       The Plaintiff (husband) has filed an appeal against part of the decision in D3224/2017 on ancillary relief regarding care and control, access and maintenance for the children and on the wife’s maintenance[^1] (DCA99/2019). In addition, he also appealed against the dismissal of his application to relocate the younger child permanently to the US in summons no. 4155/2018 (“Relocation application”) (RAS 40/2019).

## Background

2       The parties were married on xx September 2002 in Barbados. The Plaintiff husband (“husband”), aged 53 years, is a UK citizen while the Defendant wife (“wife”), aged 41 years, is a US citizen. They have two sons, \[S1\], aged 14 years and \[S2\], 11 years of age[^2]. The children hold dual citizenship in the UK and the US. The wife does some part-time hobby/business in Singapore and was staying at \[\[Property 1\]\]. At the time of the hearing, the husband was staying in New York City, USA and worked as Managing Director and Global Risk Management Head of an US bank [^3]. He claimed his take-home income was only SGD$24,720 or US$18,043.85 per month (based on the his salary in the period from 15 April to 29 September 2018)[^4].

3       For the first 2 years of their married life till September 2004, the parties lived in New York City, USA. During the next 3 years till October 2007, the parties lived at a property that the Husband bought in USA[^5]. In October 2007, the parties moved to Singapore as the husband found a job in Singapore. They stayed at various residences in Singapore, namely, at \[Property 2\](from October 2007 to March 2013), at \[Property 3\] (March 2013 to March 2015) and at \[Property 4\] (March 2015 to July 2016)[^6].

4       In July 2016, the wife left the matrimonial home with the 2 children and moved to \[\[Property 1\]\][^7]. The Husband continued to live at the \[Property 4\]. Sometime in February 2018, the husband relocated from Singapore to New York, US, to work there.

5       On 13 July 2017, the Plaintiff husband filed a writ of divorce. The Wife filed a defence and counterclaim. Interim Judgment was granted on 19 December 2017 on an uncontested basis on the basis of the wife’s and the husband’s unreasonable behaviour respectively. This marriage lasted about 15 years.

### Ancillary Order made

6       On 21 November 2018, just before the hearing of the ancillary matter hearing, the husband filed summons 4155/2018 as he wanted the younger child to relocate permanently to the US (San Francisco) in the event that he is granted care and control of him (while the older child will continue to remain in Singapore). I heard the Ancillary matters and summons no. 4155/2018 on 17 January, 26 and 27 June, and 2 and 8 August 2019. I also called for Custody Evaluation Report (CER) on the two children in view of the various allegations made against each other regarding the children.

7       During the hearing, parties were in agreement for joint custody for the children[^8]. At the hearing on 26 June 2019, they also agreed that 4 items, namely, the husband’s watches, his Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Policies (Policy Nos. 1xxx and 2xxx), his Individual 529 College Savings Account (Account No. 3xxx-01) and his Individual 529 College Savings Account (Account No. 3xxx-02), were not to be subject to division in the AM Proceedings (provided that latter 3 items were held on trust for the benefit of the children). I made a Consent Order on this[^9].

8       On 8 August 2019, after reading the affidavit evidence and the CER and upon the hearing the parties’ submissions, I dismissed the husband’s application in Summons 4155/2018. I gave brief oral reasons for my decision on this and on the ancillary reliefs and I made the following Ancillary Order:

> (1)     That the Care and control of \[S1\] and \[S2\] (collectively, the **“Children”**) be granted to the Defendant.

>> (a)       That the Plaintiff be granted Liberal access to the Children on the following terms:

>> (b)       Regular weekend access on Saturday and Sunday to the Children whenever the Plaintiff is in Singapore, subject to the Plaintiff providing the Defendant with 2 weeks’ prior notice of when he intends to be in Singapore and for how long.

>> (c)       School holiday access to both the Children for half of the summer holidays (being 1 month each) and half of the December holidays (being 1.5 weeks).

>> (d)       Each party shall have school holiday access to both the Children for one of the short school holidays per year (_i.e._ either March or October).

>> (e)       The Plaintiff shall notify the Defendant by the end of January each year which 6 weeks he intends to reserve for his school holiday access for that year. For the school holidays in year 2019, the Plaintiff shall inform the Defendant by 30 September 2019 which particular half of the school holidays that he wants to have access to the Defendant by 30 September 2019 which particular half of the school holidays that he wants to have access to the Children.

>> (f)       Both the Plaintiff and the Defendant shall be permitted to bring the Children overseas on holiday during their school holiday access period, subject to him or her providing the other party with one (1) month’s prior notice of where the Children will be travelling and staying (destination and travel itinerary, transport details such as flight numbers, accommodation details, contact details), and for what periods of time. Each party shall pay for all expenses for the Children during his or her access time with them, including the costs of the flights (inclusive of taxes and surcharges and fees) for the Children to travel on the unaccompanied Minor Scheme (if the Children are meeting the Plaintiff overseas).

>> (g)       Both Parties shall have liberal electronic and telephone access to the Children, including but not limited to WhatsApp, FaceTime, emails and text messaging, when the Children are with the other party.

> (2)     The matrimonial property known as \[US Property\] shall be sold in the open market within 6 months of the date of the Final Judgment. From the proceeds of sale less refund of any outstanding mortgage, and any other expenses incurred incidental to the sale of the said property, a sum of SGD$160,000 shall be paid to the Defendant while the remaining balance shall be paid to the Plaintiff. There shall be joint conduct of the sale of the \[US Property\]. For the avoidance of doubt, the Plaintiff shall continue to pay the mortgage repayments and all expenses relating to the matrimonial property charges and fees, for the \[US Property\] until the completion of the sale of the \[US Property\].

> (3)     As part of the division of assets, the Plaintiff shall pay to the Defendant another sum of SGD$281,086 within 3 months of the date of this Order or alternatively in six monthly instalments of SGD$46,846.67 with effect from 30 September 2019 and thereafter on the last day of each subsequent month. The Plaintiff shall confirm in writing to the Defendant by 1 September 2019 which alternative mode of payment that he intends to select to pay for this sum of moneys. If the Plaintiff does not confirm his selection of the payment mode by 1 September 2019, then the amount of the SGD$281,086 to be paid by the Plaintiff to the Defendant shall be paid in one lump sum within 3 months of the date of this Order. Payment shall be made into the Defendant's Citibank account 0xxx.

> (4)     The Citibank US Joint Account No. 9xxx and Citibank US Joint Account No. 5xxx (**“two joint Citibank accounts”**) shall be closed within 3 months of the date of Final Judgment and all the monies in the said two joint Citibank accounts shall be paid solely to the Plaintiff.

> (5)     Save as above, each Party shall retain all assets in their respective names and possession situated in Singapore and overseas, and neither Party shall have further claims against each other for further division of the matrimonial assets.

> (6)     The Plaintiff shall pay to the Defendant a sum of SGD$3,110.00 per month for the maintenance of \[S1\]and SGD$3,110.00 per month for the maintenance of \[S2\] with effect from 30 January 2019 and thereafter on the last day of each month. Payment shall be made into the Defendant's Citibank account 0xxx.

> (7)     In addition, the Plaintiff shall continue to pay directly to the school and/or vendor or organisation the school fees, school activity fees, the school bus fees, summer camp charges/fees, the private lessons/tuition and activity classes fees and the premiums for the medical and dental insurance policies for the two children of the marriage, \[S1\]and \[S2\].

> (8)     The Plaintiff shall reimburse the Defendant the costs of medical fees and dental fees that are initially paid for by the Defendant for medical and dental treatment for the two children of the marriage \[S1\] and \[S2\] within 7 days upon production of the receipts to the Plaintiff. Payment shall be made into the Defendant's Citibank account 0xxx.

> (9)     The Plaintiff shall pay to the Defendant a sum of SGD$1,560.00 per month as maintenance for the Defendant with effect from 30 January 2019 and thereafter on the last day of each month. Payment shall be made into the effect from 30 January 2019 and thereafter on the last day of each month. Payment shall be made into the Defendant's Citibank account 0xxx.

> (10)     There shall be liberty to apply.

> (11)     No order as to costs.”

9       The husband has filed an appeal against the dismissal of the relocation summons 4155/2018 and against the part of the Order on care and on care and control, access and maintenance. I now give brief reasons for my decision.

### Custody, Care and control

10     Parties had agreed that there be joint custody of the 2 children, \[S1\] and \[S2\]. The main dispute is over care and control.

### Husband’s arguments

11     As for care and control and relocation, the Plaintiff Husband prayed for joint custody for the 2 children. He also wanted the following:

> (1)     split Care and control of the children with \[S1\] to the care and control of the wife until June 2021 (or when he departs Singapore for college), whereupon care and control shall be transferred to him, with liberty for the husband to relocate \[S1\] to the US. He wanted Care and control of the younger child \[S2\], with liberty to relocate \[S2\] to the US no later than July 2019. He was prepared to have liberal access be given to the party not having care and control of the Child(ren), including overseas access.

> (2)     As for the children’s maintenance, if the two children are under the care and control of the wife, then he was prepared to pay to the Wife a cash allowance of SGD$4,500 for the Children’s expenses. In addition, he will continue to pay directly the following children’s expenses such the school fees; school bus expenses; school trips (on an ad-hoc basis and subject to his prior agreement); Medical and dental insurance premiums; Medical and dental expenses (on a reimbursement basis, subject to the wife producing the supporting receipts); and contributions for the Children’s New York’s 529 College Savings Plans.

> (3)     In the event that he is awarded care and control of younger child \[S2\], while the Defendant has care and control of older child \[S1\], he will bear all of \[S2\]’s expenses solely and pay a monthly cash allowance of $2,250 for \[S1\]’s expenses. He would pay for \[S1\]’s expenses in respect of school fees, school bus expenses, school trips, medical and dental expenses (on reimbursement basis) and contributions to Children’s New York’s 529 College Savings Plans and overseas trips with him.

> (4)     No maintenance for the Defendant wife.

> (5)     As for division of matrimonial assets, he asked that they be divided 75:25 in his favour, subject to a reduction of SGD$113,000 to account for her dissipation of assets.

12     The husband’s arguments for having care and control of the younger child \[S2\] and to immediately relocate him permanently to US were that one, that \[S2\] had a “tumultuous relationship with the Defendant wife” and could not get along with the wife’s living-in boyfriend. Two, the wife was unable to meet \[S2\]’s emotional needs and safety as they quarrelled quite often. Three, \[S2\] has made known to both of them (parents) his wish to relocate to and to live with the husband (father) in the US. Four, any separation of the two siblings as a result of \[S2\]’s relocation will be temporary. Five, the parties and children have no ties to Singapore and their stay in Singapore is uncertain and the parties never planned to remain in Singapore indefinitely. Six, the husband’s proposed care arrangements for \[S2\] would be adequate as current apartment in New York is sufficiently big to accommodate \[S2\] and the husband later intends to purchase a property in San Francisco with enough room to accommodate the husband, his new companion, \[Y\], new child \[S3\] and \[S2\]. The husband indicated he intended to send him to \[C\] High School in New Jersey. At present, the Plaintiff does not currently have a proposal for which school he intends to send \[S2\] to in San Francisco as he did not know which part of the city he will be living in. However, he felt it would not be difficult finding a suitable school as there are several good schools in San Francisco that would work well for \[S2\]. He claimed that he and his companion \[Y\] and the husband both have flexible work schedules and can make arrangements as required for the supervision of \[S2\] after school. [^10]

#### Wife’s arguments

13     The wife sought sole care and control of the 2 children and resisted the husband’s application for the younger child to be located to US by July 2019 and the older child by 2021. She said she was he primary caregiver of both the children since they were born. She was the “homemaker who contributed significantly to the running of the household, doing household chores”. Given the “husband’s job as a banker, he was not a hands-on-dad” and was a “disconnected father” and “uninvolved with the children save for special occasions and during festive season”. She said “he did not fetch the younger child to and from kindergarten or school at all and it was she and the domestic helper who took turns to drop the child off and pick him up from school”. She, on the other hand, claimed that she was a caring, nurturing parent whom the husband had in the past complimented her during marriage counselling sessions to be a “wonderful mother”[^11].

14     She was aware of the younger child’s special needs and social inhibitions and the chid is now in a very stable environment and is supported emotionally and psychologically. The children are well-settled in Singapore and they have friends in \[B\] School (older child was here since 2007 and the younger child was born here) and this continuity should not be disrupted[^12].

15     She submitted that the husband was more interested in his own life and career and this was not in the children’s interests. She said that the husband had “abandoned her and the children behind to survive and settled down when he suddenly uprooted and moved to US. The proposal to relocate and use the New Jersey house was not feasible as the house was then rented out and it is difficult to stay there as there is currently a tenancy. The said house was far away from the City and take 1.5 hours by train (41 km) to reach his own workplace. The husband had kept changing his proposal – first to buy a house in San Francisco put \[S2\] in a public school, then later he changed to want to buy a house in Los Angeles without explaining where exactly nor practical details of how he intends to take care of him (when he currently works in New York – given that Los Angeles is 6 hours away from New York by plane and time difference of 3 hours). She said considering his workload and high-profile job in New York City, the husband does not have the time to properly look after the children. Also he travels for long periods of time indifferent parts of the world[^13].

### My Decision

#### Care and Control and Relocation

16     As parties were in agreement have joint custody of the children, I agree that for joint custody, I agree that both the Plaintiff and the Defendant shall have joint custody of the 2 children of the marriage, \[S1\]and \[S2\]. [^14]

17     It is trite that in dealing with care and control and upbringing of children, the Court will take the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration, that is, to consider what is the best interest for the children. In **_Wong Phila Mae v Shaw Harold <span class="citation">\[1991\] 1 SLR(R) 680</span>_** (at \[22\]), the Court of Appeal held that the following factors, apart from continuity of arrangements, would need to be taken into account in considering the child’s best interest:

> (a)     the conduct of the parties;

> (b)     the wishes of the parents and the wishes of the child where he or she is of an age to be able to express an independent opinion;

> (c)     a young child would be best looked after by its mother;

> (d)     which party can offer better security and stability; and

> (e)     that siblings should not be separated.

18     Furthermore, in relocation applications, the Court of Appeal in **_BNS v BNT_** <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 973</span> at \[19\] to \[21, had held that the welfare of the child is paramount and this principle ought to override any other consideration. The Court of Appeal also endorsed the principle in **_TAA v TAB_** _<span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHCF 1</span>_ that “_while the wishes of parents may have a bearing on the welfare of the child, it is for the court to determine if their wishes are compatible with the interests of the child. The law expects parents to put the interests of the children before their own_”. In line with this principle, the Court “_has to consider both the reasonable wishes of the primary caregiver as well the child’s potential loss of relationship with the left-behind parent_.” Any decision in a relocation case is essentially an intensely fact-centric exercise.

19     For care and control, there was mutual agreement between the parties that, as for now, the older child \[S1\] will continue to be under the care and control of the wife and to stay in Singapore for his studies. It was also in his best interest that \[S1\] continue his studies in Singapore and be living with his mother (the wife) as he was doing well at the school \[B\][^15] and he was at a critical stage in his studies. He was also doing well in school and has close interaction with his friends and classmates at school. The affidavit evidence also supported this. This was also consistent with the Senior Court Family Specialist’s assessment in the Custody Evaluation Report (CER) which I accepted[^16]. I therefore was minded to grant care and control of the older child to the wife. I did not think it was appropriate at this stage to consider a change of care and control some 2 years later as it would be rather premature to do so. Many things would have changed by then and by that time, the situation would be clearer.

20     For the younger child \[S2\], I am of the view that it was not in his best interest for care and control be granted to the husband and for the child to be relocated to US at this time for the reasons stated below.

21     One, both the children has been staying in Singapore and attending the \[B\] school here. Besides being with the students he had been accustomed with; he has the support of the school to deal with his auditory processing difficulties, weak short term memory and social skills deficit and his suspected Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD). He has been receiving support from the school for his abstract thinking and reasoning (Fluid reasoning) and short-term auditory and visual memory (Working Memory) (which represents weakest areas of cognitive development) and help on cognitive speed to improve his reading skills[^17]. He is also attending sessions with a psychologist to deal with his lower IQ. The wife had been working closely with the \[B\] school to deal with his “skills deficit”. On the other hand, there is no specific information in the husband’s care plan and school arrangement for the younger child that appeared to address these requirements. The husband only response on this issue was “as the children were educated in line with the American education system at \[B\]… \[S2\] would have minimal difficulties adjusting to a new school in the US[^18].

22     Two, the children have been well settled in Singapore after the parties had moved to Singapore on 2007. The younger child \[S2\] was born in Singapore in 2008 and has lived here since[^19].The two children have friends in the \[B\] School and this continuity in Singapore should not be disrupted; see **_Wong Phila Mae v Shaw Harold <span class="citation">\[1991\] 1 SLR(R) 680</span>_** at \[22\]

23     Three, from the affidavit evidence, I accepted the wife’s contention that she has been the primary care giver of the 2 children since they were born. She was then a homemaker during the children’s formative years. The husband was busy with his career and work and often travels while the wife was a homemaker, with a part-time hobby. The Husband had decided to leave the children and the wife since 2018 and he moved to New York to further his career. The wife was the primary caregiver over this period and also during the earlier years of the children’s life. That does not mean that husband did not do his share of parenting (though limited) for the children. However, for the past 1 ½ years, it was the wife who took care of the children and assisted them in the educational activities during the school days. Even right now, the husband would be quite busy with his career and work to be able to spend sufficient time directly with caring for \[S2\]. This was consistent with the findings of the CER.[^20]

24     Four, there is no proper parenting plan for \[S2\] if he is relocated to US. In fact, the husband has changed his plans as to where \[S1\] will study. Initially, he claims he was working in New York and would like to send \[S1\] to a school some 20 km outside New York City until mid-2019. He had intended to take care of \[S2\] in New York and send him to school in \[C\]. As for any plans after July 2019, he said “(he) do(es) not have a proposal for the school to send \[S2\] to in _San Francisco_ as I do not know which part of the city we would be living in” and he does not anticipate any issue finding a suitable school”[^21]. However, five months later, and after the CER report was being prepared, the husband’s counsel informed the Court near the end of the hearing that the husband has now moved to _Los Angeles_ instead. Again, the husband’s counsel repeated from the bar that the child will be sent to a suitable school. The name of the school was not known, and there are no details as to whether a place has been reserved for the younger child there.

25     Five, the proposal to send \[S2\] to US and allow \[S1\] to remain in Singapore will result in the siblings _being separated_ during their teen years, which was not desirable. There was evidence that the two brothers interact often with each other and did get along although they do sometimes gets into altercations, which is to be expected. The younger child did interact well and play with his elder brother. This was supported by the observations in the CER[^22]. It was not desirable to split the siblings just to accommodate the father’s interest.

26     Six, while the child \[S2\] had indicated his wish to go to the US, he was only a pre-teen, only 11 years old, and he had been facing challenges in his studies at school because of his “skills deficits”. I have doubts as whether he had sufficient maturity to fully understand the full consequences of re-locating to the US and being separated from his brother. Even his more mature elder brother was of the view that \[S2\]’s preference was because of his “unhappiness with his mother (the wife)”, whom \[S2\] had “blamed her for the breakdown of the marriage”. All 3 persons, \[S1\], the husband and the wife were conscious that \[S2\] blamed his mother for the divorce. I accepted that \[S2\] was closer to his father (husband) than his mother. This was understandable as the wife was the main disciplinarian and was responsible to ensure that he completes his school homework while the husband was always the “fun parent”, bringing the younger child for holidays and to play. This, as the CER observed, “could also be consciously or subconsciously be motivated to obtain the husband’s parental attentions and affection as a result of the parents’ acrimony”[^23].

27     Seven, even though \[S2\] has some “disagreement and relational issues with the mother (wife)”, the wife has been the primary care giver and she has been responsible to ensuring that \[S2\] makes efforts to keep up with his studies, which he faced frustrations and did not like. The child did have difficulty given his IQ level but was managing reasonably with school support. This “strained relationship with his mother” was not so severe as the CER observations of their interactions showed that “_the wife, the children and the wife’s boyfriend seemed cordial and were able to engage easily in conversations and there were no indicators of hostility between them_”. “_The child \[S2\] was comfortable in their presence and also enjoyed interacting and did reciprocate conversations with them_”. It is not unusual for such tension to happen now and then and his relational issues between mother and child did not appear to be out of the ordinary. I am of the view that this could be ameliorated by counselling.

28     In summary, I note that the husband, at the start of the hearing, indicated to the court that he intended to relocate the younger child \[S2\] to New York and then to San Francisco. He had stated in his original affidavits that the child will first stay in New York and study in a school outside New York. At the end of the hearing however, counsel for the husband indicated that he had changed his mind and had now just moved to Los Angeles. There was no clear parenting plan for the younger child, no details of his place of residence and school (including arrangements to deal with his “skills deficits” and “likely ADHD”) and no school place reserved for him. There were no identifiable school arrangements made to handle his “special needs”. I was concerned that the husband had not carefully thought through his plans and it did not seem to be that he had the child’s best interest in mind. He seemed to be placing his own interests in priority over the child’s interest. In contrast, while the Mother was experiencing some relational issues with the child, these did not appear to be issues that were out of the ordinary. The child was in his preteens and was “experiencing a difficult time” with his parents’ divorce and his father’s relocation to US. I noted however that the mother was very aware of and more attuned to the issues and his “special needs” and had even sought help from the child’s school. The evidence showed that she was working with the school counsellors to provide the child with the help and support required to address these issues. The two children interacted frequently and enjoyed each other’s company and sometimes sleep in the same room. It would be highly disadvantageous to the two children to try to separate them from each other at this moment. If the younger child is allowed to relocate, the wife would face much more difficulty to have a meaningful face to face contact with the children in the US as she does not have the financial capacity to frequently travel to US. Taking into consideration all of the evidence before me and the CER, I was of the view that it would be in the best interests of the children that the wife be granted care and control of the two children, \[S1\]and \[S2\], and for the children to continue to study in Singapore. I therefore granted the wife care and control of the 2 children. I also dismissed the application for relocation of the younger child in Summons 4155/2018.

#### Access

29     On access, it is trite that the purpose of access is to allow the parent not having care and control of the children to maintain regular contact with them: see **_BG v BF_** <span class="citation">\[2007\] SGCA 32</span> at \[11\], **_TV v TW_** <span class="citation">\[2007\] SGHC 113</span> at \[93\]. It is not primarily meant to significantly allow the child to build a rapport with the Husband’s girlfriend or parents or with his other child whom he had with his new partner. Using a broad brush approach, I therefore allowed the husband liberal access to the children that mirrored the current arrangements and were substantially similar to those proposed by the parties. It was almost identical to the one proposed by the husband with each parents having half of the school holidays with the children (see Paragraph 56 to 57.14 of HS-1),

## Division of Matrimonial Assets

30     There was no appeal against the division of matrimonial assets. For completeness, I will list out the final division of these assets. The value of the pool of matrimonial assets was ascertained to be SGD$1,444,352 (after excluding 4 items from the division based on parties’ agreement[^24]). The direct financial contributions to the pool of matrimonial assets was in the ratio of 83.6% and 16.4 % in favour of the husband. Applying the approach in **_ANJ v ANK_** and considering the indirect contributions, and using a broad brush approach, I found that it was just and equitable to arrive at the final ratio for the division of 62 %: 38% for the husband and wife respectively. The wife would be entitled to about $548,853.00 of the pool (this includes $123,112 worth of assets in her own name[^25]) while the Husband’s final share of the pool stood at 62% and he would receive about $895,499.00.

## Maintenance

#### Children’s maintenance

31     Under section 127 of the Women’s Charter, the Court may order the non-custodial parent to pay the other party an amount towards the maintenance of a child of the marriage. The court will have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the list of non-exhaustive considerations in section 69(4) of the Women’s Charter, such as the standard of living enjoyed by the child as well as the manner in which the child was being educated or trained.[^26].

32     The husband was prepared to pay directly 100% of the children’s school fees, school bus fees, school trips and medical and dental premiums[^27]. During the marriage, he paid for all of the children’s and household expenses. I turn to assess the husband’s ability to bear the children’s expenses. The husband claimed that his take-home monthly income was only SGD$24,720 or US$18,043.85[^28]. However, this was based on his salary for only a 7-month period in 2018 (from 15 April to 29 September 2018) and did not include bonuses. The husband salary in US in 2018 after February 2018 was a basic sum of USD$425,000. After deducting federal tax (USD$129,961), New York State tax (USD$128,961), New York resident tax (USD$16,840.30) and adding tax refund of USD$939.70, his net salary would be USD$250,112 or SGD$337,651 (based on exchange rate of 1 USD to 1.35 SGD). In early 2018, the husband received a bonus of SGD$431,866 in January 2018 (excluding his allowance of SGD$82,190). He paid tax of SGD$202,353. His approximate take home earnings in year 2018 would be SGD$567,164 or an average of SGD$47,263 per month (net US pay equivalent to $337,651 plus $431,866 bonus less Singapore taxes of $202,353)[^29]. I used this as his earning capacity as it was his most recent pay figures. The wife claimed that she earns only a net figure SGD $2,000 per month. With her graduate qualifications and the documents relating to her previous business, I estimate her earning capacity to be at least a take-home pay of SGD$3,000 per month. The husband estimated his monthly expenses to be USD$20,860 (or SGD$28,659) which appeared excessive. A reasonable figure would be likely to be slightly less than half of the claimed expenses per month. As the husband earned significantly more than the wife and since he has in the past been paying the fill expenses of the children, I considered it fair for the husband to continue to pay 100% expenses of the 2 children.

33     For the reasonable expenses of the children, I took into account the children would need a roof over their head and would incur a share of the household and domestic helper’s expenses. I reject the wife’s claim that her rental expense was $5,500 per month[^30] based on the loan agreement at pages 82 and 83 of her 2nd Ancillary Affidavit WA-2 because one, the alleged loan agreement between \[D\] for a loan $5,500 per month at page 82 regard did not mention that it was meant to pay rental or that it was a rental agreement: Two, the wife’s version was also contradicted by paragraph 12 of Mr \[F\]’s affidavit wherein Mr \[F\] alleged that “her imputed rental was $7,500.00”. Where the wife and the children lives as a tenant in a property or is an owner of a property, the mortgage repayment or monthly market rental can be included as the Wife and the children’s reasonable accommodation expenses for purposes of maintenance: see **_UEB v UEC_** <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHCF 5</span> at \[4\] to \[10\]. As the parties used to live in rented private condominium units in the Central area of Singapore (Districts 9, 10 and 11) during their marriage even though the children were attending school at \[B\] in Woodlands, I considered it fair to use the market rental of a 3-bedroom condominium unit of a size between 1,200 to 1,400 sq. ft. as reasonable accommodation cost. That would be comparable to the standard of living enjoyed by the children. Based on various advertised rental units submitted byte parties, I consider that a reasonable rental accommodation costs would be about $4,300.00 per month.

34     The reasonable household expenses would amount to about $5,958 per month (rental expenses of $4,300, groceries ($1,000), Pharmacy and vitamins ($28), Utilities ($530), dry cleaning ($100); the rest of the items were disallowed). The reasonable domestic helpers’ costs would be about $1,088.50 per month (Salary ($700), return air ticket ($15), Medical check-up ($8), (Agency fees ($80), Domestic helper’s levy ($265), Insurance for domestic helper ($20.50)). Each child’s share would be $1,986.00 and $362.80 respectively as the reasonable household costs ought to be shared equally amongst a family of 3. I allowed the following reasonable expenses for the children’s monthly maintenance as shown in the tables below.

35     For older child \[S1\], the reasonable expenses were made out as follows:

37     In addition, the husband would also have to bear the costs of the school related charges of $3,111 per month (school fees ($2945), School activities ($50) and School bus fees ($116)) for \[S2\]) (and Summer camp fees (equivalent to $571.50 per month).9

38     I had earlier stated that the husband ought to be paying for 100% of the children’s expenses in view of his sufficient financial resources. Based on the above, I therefore ordered the husband to pay a monthly sum of SGD$3,110 (rounded off) for each child’s maintenance. In addition, he will pay directly the children’s school fees, school bus, school activities, school trips and medical and dental health insurance premiums etcetera.

#### Wife’s maintenance

39     “The power to order maintenance is supplementary to the power to order division of matrimonial assets, and the courts regularly take into account each party's share of the matrimonial assets when assessing the appropriate quantum of maintenance to be ordered. The overarching principle embodied in s 114(2) of the Women’s Charter was that of financial preservation, which required the wife to be maintained at a standard, which was, to a reasonable extent, commensurate with the standard of living she had enjoyed during the marriage”: see **_Foo Ah Yan v Chiam Heng Chow_** <span class="citation">\[2012\] 2 SLR 506</span>; <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGCA 15</span>.

40     Given that the wife’s earning capacity is so low when compared to the husband’s (she was a homemaker) and taking into account that her final share of the asset pool was not significant huge, I find it was appropriate to order maintenance for the wife to bring her to a comparable standard of living (but not the same) she had enjoyed during the marriage. Her reasonable expenses were as follows:

41     As mentioned above (at \[32\]), the Wife’s earning capacity was assessed to be $3,000 per month. Hence, the husband should provide a sum of $1,560 to support the ex-wife. I therefore ordered the husband to pay a monthly sum of $1,560 as maintenance for the wife.

## Costs

42     As both parties did not “succeed” in their respective claims on the division of the matrimonial assets and maintenance, I find that it was appropriate to order each party to bear his or her own costs.

The bank records also revealed that between August 2016 till the Interim Judgment date, Mr \[F\] had transferred a total net amount of $46,500 (based on interbank transfers between their bank accounts) to the Wife (which she claimed she borrowed from him) and that would be the amount she owed to Mr \[F\]. After deducting that sum of $46,500 (to be returned to Mr \[F\]), the amount that was ploughed back into the pool was $63,500.00 ($50,000 + $60,000 - $46,500): See pg 93, 94, 95 of HA-2, and pg 13,14,137,141 of WVA-1.The amount the husband would have to pay to the wife after the division of matrimonial assets would be as follows:
