Committal and Personal Protection Order

9 December 2019

### District Judge Toh Wee San:

1       This is an appeal by the defendant wife (“W”) in respect of two of my decisions based on the same set of facts. W appealed against my committal orders against her and my dismissal of her application for a personal protection order for her child. Both sides also appealed against the two sets of costs which I ordered W to pay for both actions. I explain my decision below.

### Background

2       Parties were married in December 2012. Their marriage fell apart and they filed many applications against each other. I heard their contested divorce and interim judgement was granted on 27 April 2017 based on the defendant husband (“H”)’s unreasonable behaviour. H did not dispute that he had an improper association with a female colleague. In May 2018, the court called for a custody evaluation report (“CER”) as parties have a daughter born in April 2014 (“the child”) and they could not agree on the child issues. After the CER was issued and while parties were preparing for the AM hearing, W alleged that H molested the child (“the allegation”). After that, W did not comply with the court orders which allowed H to have access to the child and H took up committal action. W also applied for a personal protection order (“PPO”) against H for the child.

3       For H’s committal application, his case was on 7th March 2017, the court ordered that H shall have weekly access and replacement access (if applicable) to the child (“Order 1”). However W refused to comply with the order on many occasions, thus breaching Order 1 due to her allegation. She also applied to vary the unsupervised child access. This was not entirely successful and on 7th September 2018, the court ordered that H had to bring along an adult relative for his access to the child (“Order 2”). But W still refused to comply even though W did not lodge any appeal against Order 2. The relevant parts under Orders 1 and 2 are set out below.

> _Order 1:_      _the Plaintiff (i.e. H) is to have unsupervised access to the child of the marriage as follows: (i) 8 am to 8 pm every Saturday and (ii) 5 pm to 8 pm every Tuesday and Thursday. In the event that either party is unable to comply with the aforesaid access orders, he or she shall inform the other party 3 days beforehand and an alternative suitable date for access in replacement shall be agreed upon._

> _Order 2:_      _For avoidance of doubt, the access order remains intact and the father shall bring along an adult relative for his access to the child._

4       In September 2018, the court ordered the child protection unit (“CPU”) to investigate the allegation and recommend a suitable access arrangement. After considering CPU’s report, the court ordered supervised access between H and the child. Upon completion of the supervised visitations, the court considered the confidential progress report provided and ordered supervised exchange in March 2019. W refused to comply but did not appeal against the order. Instead she applied for a PPO against H, for the child on the same facts alleged below. Pending the hearing of the PPO, parties attended mediation and agreed on an access arrangement.

5       I heard both H’s committal application and W’s PPO application before deciding on them concurrently.

## The Law and issues

### The Committal application

6       Section 12 of the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act empowers the court to punish a person who has committed contempt of court, by a fine not exceeding S$12,000 and/or imprisonment not exceeding 12 months. Rule 763 of the Family Justice Rules (“FJR”) empowers the court to suspend the execution of the committal orders. In addition, there are well-established principles that committal proceedings are a last resort for family proceedings, must be proven beyond reasonable doubt and procedural safeguards are important. In the present instance, H’s allegation was W breached the court orders which was not disputed by W. W’s defence was she had valid reasons not to give access and the issue was whether this was acceptable.

### The PPO application

7       Section 65 of the Women’s Charter empowers the court to issue a protection order for the applicant if the court is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that family violence has been committed or is likely to be committed against a family member and that it is necessary for the protection of the family member to do so. Section 64 describes “family violence” under four types of acts of violence. In the present instance, W applied for a protection order against H for the child on her allegation. H did not dispute that he would have committed a criminal act and an act of violence if W has proven her allegation. However H’s case was he did not carry out any molest on the child and the police has confirmed that no action would be taken against him. Hence the issue was whether W had proven her allegation on a balance of probability.

## Parties’ brief positions and decision

### H’s committal application

8       H’s case was W failed to give him access on 35 occasions and W did not have valid reasons for breaching the court orders. W did not dispute that she did not give access on the 35 occasions in question but countered that she had good reasons. I provide a summary table of the evidence adduced by the parties and the court’s decision.

During this period, W will still have one full Sunday access to the child once every month.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

### W’s PPO application

9       W relied on the same facts as above to apply for her protection order against H for the child. W had obtained an expedited order earlier on when she came to lodge a complaint. For the PPO hearing, she applied to call the child as a witness but did not succeed. W also provided written evidence which were not contested by H from the childcare teaching staff that the child had self-touching episodes and the child claimed that she learnt them from her father. W also produced a audio recording that the child told W that “Hun Dan” who was identified as the father had touched her private parts. W also provided the doctors’ written reports that the child informed that H had molested her. H did not dispute these evidence but largely argued that they were all unreliable hearsay evidence since they came from the child.

10     H totally denied W’s allegation that he had taught the child to touch herself and he had molested the child. H also countered that he was completely unaware of the child’s story that she learnt the self-touching conduct from him as the school did not inform him until he learnt about it from W’s court application papers. H asserted that it was clear from the child’s behaviour in court via the video link and also the child’s conduct after the court proceeding (as conveyed by W’s lawyer) that the child was very stressed by W’s persistent attempt to put the child on the stand and the child felt upset for letting W down by her non-performance. While H conceded that the audio recording reflected W and the child’s voice, he also opined that the recording was not reliable as the child had never addressed him as “Hun Dan”. “Hun Dan” means “a despicable person” in mandarin. According to H, the child does not even address him as “papa” at all. The child communicated with H and her paternal grandparents in English. The child addressed H as “Daddy” at all times. H called two witnesses who were his parents and the child’s grandparents. The paternal grandparents provided consistent evidence that the child had a close and loving relationship with H and them. The grandparents also confirmed that the child spoke to H in English, addressed H as “daddy” and never mentioned about H teaching her to touch herself or H touching her inappropriately. In conclusion, H produced a letter from the police force to confirm that the investigations against him was completed and no action would be taken against him.

## Court’s decision and reasons

11     On the day of the hearing and in accordance with procedures, the court counsellors first engaged the child without my attendance to make the child feel comfortable. The court counsellor then brought the child to a separate room to give evidence via video-link. When the child first appeared on the screen, I found her action to be normal. Both parties also looked happy to see their child. However as I tried to administer the oath, the child told me that she did not know why she was in court, she could not remember the incident and she also did not understand what “telling the truth” meant. The child repeated the last two statements twice each. However she then went on to say “Hun Dan touched my pee-pee” after being asked specifically by W’s counsel on who touched her. The case was stood down after this and W’s lawyers applied to allow the child to speak in Mandarin via an interpreter, explaining that the child was more comfortable in the Mandarin language as the mother spoke to her in that language. W’s lawyers also submitted that the child was interviewed by the court counsellors before the commencement of the hearing and found to be fit to testify before the court proceeded. H’s lawyer objected to their application arguing that conversing in the English language was never an issue raised by W or her lawyers. If this was the case, such an application should have been made from the start. H’s lawyer also objected to the child being called as a witness as the child may not be able to understand further questions during cross examination and also the impact of her evidence. I provide an extract of the child’s testimony recorded in the Annex.

12     I rejected W’s application under section 120 of the Evidence Act, after I assessed the child’s evidence and demeanour via the video-link. I opined that the child was unfit to give evidence as she was not able to comprehend what telling the truth and giving evidence in court meant due to her tender age. I did not think that she would be able to answer cross-examination questions in a meaningful way. While the court counsellors had engaged the child and formed the opinion that the child was suited to give evidence, the responsibility and powers to assess the witness’s ability to give evidence lies with the Judge. It was clear that the child turned out to be incapable of giving evidence only after she was put on the stand and asked more questions by the court. I informed both sides that I did not see or speak with the child when the case was stood down. Though not required in law, I informed the counsellors and they in turn expressed support for my intended decision to reject W’s application for the child to testify. Though not recorded in the notes of evidence, W’s counsel subsequently applied to call the child as a witness again and shared with me that the child was stressed by the earlier court event. I rejected the application a second time as I maintained my view that the child was not fit to give evidence due to her tender years. Parties agreed that there was no need to call the childcare teacher, principal or the doctors who examined the child. These parties relied on what the child had told them. The childcare teacher and principal’s evidence were the child had told them it was H who taught her the self-touching action. The doctors’ evidence were also it was the child who told them about the molest carried out by H, but nothing conclusive was found from examining the child. W also relied on a audio recording that the child had told her that H had touched her private part. W suggested that it was possible for H to molest the child as there were opportunities for him to do so when he brought the child home for access and there were periods in which H’s parents were not in Singapore.

13     After careful consideration, I dismissed W’s application. Though child molest is a very serious allegation and one may tend to be cautious and order supervised access until the child is older, I should only decide based on the evidence adduced before me. Imposing supervised access on H as a precaution would not be fair to H and may be detrimental to his relationship with the child. H had testified before me that the relationship between him and the child had been negatively impacted by the lack of access for a period of time. W and her witnesses have largely relied on the information from the child. I also viewed the audio recording of the child with great caution, in view of the unusual behaviour of the child. The child herself was not permitted to testify for the reasons explained above. In short, the evidence adduced by W lacked reliability. On the contrary, H had denied any wrong-doing against the child. He also provided confirmation from the police that no action would be taken against him after the investigations were completed. H was further corroborated by his parents. I found H and his parents to be reliable and nothing objectionable in their evidence. In conclusion, I found that W had not proven her case on a balance of probability. The court did not take into account other reports which were the CER and three further reports by independent assessors from the child protection unit, the supervised access and the counselling agencies as these were for the AM matters.

14     As for whether W’s commencement of a PPO complaint right amounted to an abuse of court process, I opined that it was debatable. H’s counsel had earlier tried to strike out W’s PPO complaint before me by arguing that it was an abuse of process but he was not successful. H’s counsel pointed out that W did not appeal against the supervised exchange order issued in March 2019, but filed a PPO instead. During the PPO trial, W admitted that she wanted a protection order so that she can ask for supervised access for the child. But her reason behind that was also to protect the child. I informed parties that I was not inclined to order costs on indemnity basis but I heard their arguments on costs.

## Costs

15     H’s counsel argued essentially that costs follow the events. H has succeeded in both his committal proceeding and contesting W’s PPO application. H’s counsel submitted that I should look at the legal principles and quantums under the third schedule of the Family Justice Rules as a guide. H’s counsel submitted that I should order S$22,500 for the committal proceeding and S$15,000 per day for the PPO trial. Regarding disbursements, parties can try to agree, failing which they should be taxed.

16     W’s counsel argued that the schedule was not applicable. W’s counsel argued that W was only doing what any mother would do to protect her child, without any ill intent. W was fully cooperative and had allowed CPU to carry out supervised access once CPU took over. W’s counsel also argued that the facts in both matters were essentially the same and not complicated. Hence even if the court ordered costs, they should be minimal.

17     After considering both sides, I ordered W to pay $3,000 for the one day committal proceeding and $7,000 for the two days of PPO trial. I agreed with H that costs follow the events. I derived these quantums after considering the time spent and complexity of the matters. In particular, I noted that W had pushed ahead with her PPO application, despite knowing the police’s decision not to take any action against H after completing their investigations.

## Conclusion

18     This was a very unfortunate case. I can tell that parties love their child very much and both wanted to know the truth. However the court can only decide based on the evidence before me. I urge parties to put the unhappy past behind and continue to place the child’s interest as priority. In particular, I commented to W that she had to accept the outcome from the police investigation, decision from this court and trust H in order to move on. Subsequent to my decision, W applied for a stay of execution and I granted her application. The next thing left is to finalise the access orders arising from the divorce. I called for a review of the last CER as so many things had happened and more than a year had passed since then. I also requested the evaluator to look into whether any therapy or support is needed for this family.
