shared care and control weekend access overnight access overseas access

25 August 2020

### District Judge Suzanne Chin:

## Introduction

1       These are my grounds of decision relating to the Plaintiff’s (“Father”) application for sole-custody and care and control of his 5 year old daughter. After hearing from the parties and considering their submissions as well as the Custody Evaluation Report issued by MSF, I made orders which granted shared care and control of the child to the parties. The Mother has filed an appeal against part of my orders and I set out below the reasons for my decision.

## Background

2       The parties were married on 1 March 2015. After the marriage, parties moved in with the Father’s parents. The child was born in July 2015 and the parties together with the child continued living with the Father’s parents. From the time that the child was born, both parties worked and were supported by the Father’s parents in their caregiving responsibilities towards the child. Having reached school going age, the child was enrolled in and attended school.

3       On 14 April 2019, an argument ensued between the parties and the Defendant (“Mother”), left the Father’s parents’ home, returning with the child to her parents’ home in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. On 4 July 2019, the Father filed this application for sole custody and care and control of the child. His application also included a request for the return of the child to Singapore. The child was 4 years of age at the time.

4       On 23 July 2019, an order was made for the return of the child to Singapore within 2 weeks of the date of the order. Pursuant to the order, the Mother brought the child back to Singapore as per the order and with the agreement of the Father, started residing at the Housing Development Board flat that the parties had recently purchased but never lived in (“matrimonial flat”), with the child. The child however did not resume attendance at school until sometime in early September 2019.

5       The matter was referred to mediation at the Child Focussed Resolution Centre after the order to return the child was made. On 8 August 2019, the Mother filed an application for a Personal Protection Order (“PPO”) for both herself and the child as well as a Domestic Exclusion Order (“DEO”) over the matrimonial flat. On 22 August 2019, an interim consent order was recorded. The interim consent order essentially granted to the Father 3 hours of access each week supervised by the Mother. On 9 September 2019, a further consent order was recorded, this time with parties consenting to joint custody of the child as well as supervised access being granted to the Father at the Divorce Support Specialist Agencies (“DSSA”) for a period of 8 sessions.

6       The trial for the Mother’s application for a PPO for herself and the child as well as a DEO over the matrimonial home were fixed for hearing before me on 2 days. After hearing from both parties, I made a finding that the Mother had not proven on the balance of probabilities that the Father had committed family violence on either of the Mother and the child. Accordingly, I dismissed the Mother’s application for the PPO for herself and the child as well as the DEO over the matrimonial home. No appeal has been filed against the dismissal of the Mother’s applications.

## The applicable legal principles

7       Section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act (Cap 122) states that:

> “ Where in any proceedings before any court, the custody or upbringing of an infant or administration of any property belonging to or held in trust for an infant or the application of the income thereof is in question, the court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration and save insofar as such welfare otherwise requires, the father of an infant shall not be deemed to have any right superior to that of the mother in respect of such custody, administration or application nor shall the mother be deemed to have any claim superior to that of the father.”

8       “Welfare” must be taken in its widest sense. It has been said that the welfare of the child is not to be measured by money only nor by physical comfort only; the moral and religious welfare of the child must be considered as well as his physical well-being; nor can the ties of affection be disregarded. The rights and wishes of parents must be assessed and weighed in their bearing on the welfare of the child in conjunction with all other factors relative to that issue. The question before the judge is not what the essential justice of the case requires but what the best interests of the child requires (see _Soon Peck Wah v Woon Che Chye_ \[1997\] 3 SLR (R) 430).

9       As the parties had reached agreement on the other prayers requested for, namely the return of the child to Singapore and custody of the child, the sole issue that remained before the court was that of care and control and access.

## The Father’s position

10     In his application, the Father was asking amongst other things, that sole care and control of the child to be granted to him with reasonable access to the Mother. It was his position that the Mother had taken the child away from her home and from him without his consent. According to him, while she was in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, he had attempted to go every weekend to visit the child and was very concerned that the child had not been going to school and was missing out on the various enrichment classes. He claimed to have been the primary caregiver of the child since birth and also up to the time that the child was taken away and as such had a very close relationship with her. He also explained that he had arranged for the child’s school, something which the Mother took very little interest in. It was his contention that ever since the child was brought to Johor Bahru by the Mother in April 2019 and even after her return to Singapore, the child had become quiet and withdrawn, a shadow of the bubbly and bright child that she had been. He explained that the child had become guarded with him, hesitating to speak to him without first seeking the permission of the Mother.

11     He maintained that care and control of the child should not be given to the Mother as he believed that she had shown by her past actions, that she would do everything in her power to keep the child away from him and use the child as a pawn against him. In addition, he pointed out that the Mother being Malaysian, did not have a support system in Singapore. He also informed the court that the Mother had not allowed his parents to have any contact with the child since April 2019 when she removed the child from her home even though they had been instrumental in taking care of the child since birth.

## The Mother’s position

12     The Mother claimed that the Father had never cared for the child and during the entire time she was in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, had never visited the child. She claimed that she had left the Father’s parents’ home with the child as the Father had committed violence against her in the presence of the child. The Mother contended that she has always been and continues to be the primary care giver of the child. She has always been very involved in the child’s education and has dealt with all day to day decisions concerning the child. Accordingly, she wanted sole care and control to be granted to her.

13     The Mother argued that based on the age of the child, the maternal bond between mother and child should be given pertinent consideration. She also argued that notwithstanding her work commitments, she had always made time to spend time with the child and to attend to her personal needs. It was her position that the Father on the other hand outsourced his childcaring responsibilities to his parents and was very reliant on his parents to look after the child. In this regard, she questioned the ability of the Father’s parents to take care of the child. She also argued that shared care and control would be unworkable and would not be in the child’s best interests given the bitter relationship between the parties.

## Child Reports

14     As the parties had agreed to 8 sessions of supervised access, I was furnished with a report which provided me with insight into the Father-Child interaction. Notwithstanding, given the age of the child and the fact that she has been essentially living away from her Father for the past year, I wanted a more comprehensive assessment of the situation. Accordingly, I made orders for a custody evaluation report to be prepared by the Ministry of Social and Family Development. I have read through each of these reports and have in my decision, taken into consideration the observations and recommendations provided.

## Decision on Care and Control

15     In cases where disputes on child issues are placed before the court, the overriding principle that the court needs to look at is the best interests of the child. I proceeded to weigh up the parties’ positions in relation to various key factors.

## Primary caregiver

16     Each of the parties contended that they were the primary caregiver of the child prior to April 2019 when the Mother removed the child from the Father’s parents’ home. Taking into consideration the fact that each of the parties held full time jobs during this period and did not dispute the fact that the child was taken care of during the time they were at work by the Father’s parents, I determined that it was likely that neither had been the primary caregiver of the child. In this regard, I arrived at the conclusion that each had probably contributed in their own ways as a parent. For instance, the Father’s contentions that he had shown interest in the child’s academic progress and development through active engagement with the child’s school teachers was corroborated. Likewise, I accepted that the Mother would have during this period provided input into the child’s basic needs after work and spent time with the child.

17     Since April 2019, after the Mother had unilaterally removed the child from her home, she had become the child’s primary caregiver supported by her own mother while she was at work. I have accordingly considered this in its context.

18     What is also notable in relation to the child’s primary caregiver is that fact that during the 1st four years of her life, the paternal grandparents of the child were heavily involved in her care. This was not disputed. The child had clearly spent a considerable amount of time with both paternal grandparents and they appeared to have been a constant in her life from birth. Given the fact that the child clearly had an established bond with them which played a part in allowing her to thrive, I was deeply concerned as to the impact their sudden absence from her life after April 2019 had on the child.

## Ability to meet the needs of the child and the parental care plan

19     At the time of the hearing, each of the parties held fairly stable jobs with comparable salaries. The Father continued to reside with his parents in their home, where the child had resided for the 1st four years of her life before she was removed. As such, it would appear that should the Father be granted care and control of the child, she would likely return to reside in her paternal grandparents’ home and will be taken care of jointly by her Father and his parents.

20     The Mother currently resides in the matrimonial home with the child and is supported by her mother while she is at work. Should care and control be granted to her, this support from her mother is likely to continue.

21     In light of the above, as far as parental care plan is concerned, I find both parties were equally placed.

## Gatekeeping

22     It is a well recognised and established principle that children from broken homes far better if they are allowed to bond with both parents. In fact, it is the right of the child to be afforded the opportunity to establish a continuing relationship with both parents and it is not for either parent to decide to exclude the other from the child’s life. This is of course barring exceptional circumstances. An example of an exceptional circumstance would be where a parent had inflicted family violence on a child such that it would not be in the child’s best interests to develop a relationship with that parent.

23     I noted that since the child had been removed from her home at the Father’s parent’s residence, the Mother has restricted the Father’s access to the child. Currently, the Father’s interaction with the child has been limited to weekly supervised visitation sessions at the DSSA and a 2-hour access session in a public area with the Mother supervising by sitting close by. This in my view is highly unsatisfactory and is likely to hinder any meaningful interaction between Father and child.

24     The Mother claims that this type of limited access is required as the Father has committed family violence on her and indirectly on the child who had observed the family violence being inflicted by the Father on the Mother. On this issue of family violence, it should be noted that I had presided at the trial where the Mother’s application for a PPO and a DEO for both herself and the child were heard and after consideration of all evidence and submissions of the parties, I had dismissed the PPO application. My dismissal of the Mother’s applications was based on the my finding that no family violence had been committed by the Father against the Mother and since the Mother’s sole complaint in relation to the child was that the child had witnessed the Family Violence inflicted by the Father on the Mother, I had also made a finding that no Family Violence has been committed on the child by the Father. I had also noted earlier in these grounds that the Mother has not filed any appeal against the dismissal of her PPO and DEO applications.

25     In light of the above and as there is no other exceptional circumstances raised by the Mother, there appears to be no reason why the Father’s access to the child should in any way be restricted. It was as such of concern to this court that notwithstanding the dismissal of her PPO application, the Mother continues to claim that Family Violence has been committed against her and the child by the Father and continues to maintain that he should not be allowed to see the child without her being present.

26     Given her attitude towards the Father’s access to the child, it was my view that continuing with the current access supervised by the Mother will not be in the best interests of the child.

## Observations on interactions between the child and the parties

27     During the observations of interactions that the child had with each of the parties, it was very clear that both had a good relationship with the child and the child responded well to both parties. While the child has not had much of a chance to bond with her Father, especially given the constraints imposed during this circuit breaker period, taking all of the findings in the report into consideration, I believe that the Father clearly has the potential to re-establish a strong parental bond with the child if given the opportunity.

## Co-parenting

28     It was observed that the level of acrimony between the parties was at a fairly high level and this acrimony was largely attributable disagreements between them on the care giving and financial arrangements as well as the alleged spousal violence. While the issue of spousal violence has been dealt with as mentioned above, I did not think that the parties’ disagreements in relation to caregiving and financial arrangements were insurmountable and could be taken care of by clarity in the court orders. While both may have different parenting styles, it was clear that both demonstrated a knowledge and awareness of the child’s day to day needs. It was also evident that each loved the child dearly and observations showed that both provided the child with the necessary love and affection. In the round, I was optimistic that once the “dust settles”, the parties will be able to set aside their differences and ease into an appropriate co-parenting arrangement which will benefit the child in the long run.

## Shared Care and Control

29     Upon consideration of all of the above and taking into consideration what I consider to be in the child’s best interests, I am ordering that the parties share care and control of the child. Given the history and issues outlined above, I am of the view that a systemic step-down supervised access approach with the necessary facilitative support from relevant professionals would help the Father in re-establishing his relationship with the child.
