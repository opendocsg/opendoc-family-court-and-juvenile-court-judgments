Family Law – GIA – Maintenance for the child; child’s pre and post-natal expenses

13 September 2019

### District Judge Christine Lee:

### Introduction

1       The present appeal is by the Defendant in OSG 170/2017 against almost all of the paragraphs of the Court’s decision made on 31 May 2019 regarding the maintenance and pre and post-natal expenses payable by the Defendant to the Plaintiff for the child of their relationship.

### Background Facts

2       The Defendant Father (the Father) and the Plaintiff Mother (the Mother) are not married. They have one (1) child out of their relationship namely, \[B\], male, Date of Birth \[xxx\] 2017 now 2 years old.

3       On 4 August 2017, the Mother filed OSG 170/2017 seeking custodial and financial orders against the Father. Following the Father’s failure to appear at the hearing of this OSG case on 16 November 2017, an Order of Court was issued against the Father on the same date. The Father was not represented by Counsel at the time.

4       The Father subsequently appointed Counsel and the Father’s Counsel filed SUM 4175/2017 to set aside the 16 November 2017 Court Order and fix the OSG case for re-hearing.

5       The Father’s application in SUM 4175/2017 was heard by this Court on 8 February 2018. After considering the submissions made, the Court allowed the re-hearing of three (3) clauses of the said 16 November 2017 Court Order relating to the maintenance and pre and post-natal expenses payable by the Father to the Mother.

6       The Mother filed an appeal against the Court’s decision to allow the re-hearing of those 3 clauses of the said 16 November 2017 Court Order. The Mother’s appeal was dismissed on 20 September 2018 and the matter was sent back to the Court for the re-hearing.

7       The Court dealt with the 3 clauses of the said 16 November 2017 Court Order and the consequential addition of two other clauses of the same Court Order on two hearing dates namely, 22 March 2019 and 8 May 2019. The Court then adjourned the matter to 31 May 2019 whereupon the Court delivered its decision. The Father appeared in person at the first hearing date but was represented by Counsel thereafter.

8       The Father filed Notice of Appeal on 14 June 2019 in HCF/DCA 72/2019 against all but one paragraph of the Court’s decision made on 31 May 2019.

### The Appeal

9       The Father is appealing against the following seven out of eight paragraphs of the 31 May 2019 Court Order (“the said Court Order”) which provisions are set out below for ease of reference (italics added):

> **Paragraphs 2 to 8 of the said Court Order**

> _2_.     _The \[Father\] shall also pay for half of the said Child’s current child care costs in the sum of_ **_S$992_** _per month (being 50% of $1,985 rounded off) within 14 days of the production of receipts for such expenses with effect from June 2019._

> _3_.     _The \[Father\] shall also pay for half of the said Child’s future education and education-related expenses within 14 days of the production of receipts for such expenses. To avoid all doubt, this refers to school fees, equipment required for school purposes, costs of school uniforms, school bags, and school shoes, school transport and tuition/enrichment classes. Provided always that the \[Mother\] does not sign up the said Child at any school or for any tuition/enrichment classes without the \[Father’s\] prior consent which shall not be unreasonably withheld._

> _4_.     _The \[Father\] shall also pay for half of the medical (including hospitalisation) and dental expenses of the said Child within 14 days of the production of receipts for such expenses for treatment at government hospitals/clinics only. Provided always that the Parties should utilise the maximum allowable under the said Child’s insurance policy (policies) if any. Provided also that if private medical treatment is required for the said Child then the \[Father’s\] prior consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, must be obtained and he shall thereby also be liable for half of these expenses._

> _5_.     _The \[Father\] shall further pay the \[Mother\] the sum of $15,321.84 being the pre and post-natal expenses incurred by the \[Mother\] for the said Child’s delivery and other birth related expenses in instalments over 16 months in the sum of_ **_S$958 as rounded off_** _per month with effect from 1 July 2019 and thereafter on the first day of each month until such sum is completely paid up._

> _6_.     _The \[Father\] shall also pay the \[Mother\] the sum of $2,482.045 (being 50% of $4,964.09) for the costs of the said Child’s baby items by way of 12 instalments in the sum of_ **_S$207 as rounded off_** _per instalment per month also with effect from 1 July 2019 and thereafter on the first day of each month until this sum is also completely paid up._

> _7_.     _The monthly maintenance and all other payments ordered herein are to be deposited into the \[Mother’s\] United Overseas Bank (UOB) Bank Account Number \[xxx\]-\[xxx\]-\[xx\]3-5._

> _8._      _Parties are at liberty to apply._

### Summary of the Court’s reasons for making the said Court Order

10     The Court considered the Father’s obligation to the said child in three (3) areas: (i) necessities in the form of monthly maintenance for the said child (ii) the said child’s future educational and medical needs and (iii) the pre and post-natal expenses and costs of baby items incurred by the Mother. Before making its decision in all 3 areas, the Court also took into account the Father’s submissions on his ability to pay.

11     With regard to the first area, being the said child’s monthly maintenance, the Father has not appealed against the Court’s order that the Father should pay the Mother the sum of $540.00 per month on the basis of ¼ liability of the Court assessed reasonable monthly expenses for the said child, as one of the Father’s four children[^1]. This was at 25% share of $2,164 = $541 rounded to $540 per month.

12     With regard to the second area, the Court took into account the fact that the said child was being assessed for autism. The Court accepted the Mother’s submission that moving back to \[Country redacted\] was not in the said child’s best interests and that such move could come at the cost of the loss of the Father’s bond and contact with the said child. The Court therefore took into account the undisputed fact that the education and medical subsidies given to children who are Singapore citizens, could not be available for the said child who is a \[Country redacted\] citizen.

13     As such, the Court considered that for the said child’s future educational needs, the Mother was claiming the monthly sum of $1,985.00 as she had enrolled the said child into full time child care and for which she submitted that the Father should pay 70% thereof. The Court was of the view that these child care costs of $1,985.00 should be put into a separate provision since the Mother had already included the costs of a domestic helper in her estimated monthly expenses, which the Court had pro-rated[^2] in its assessment of the reasonable monthly expenses for the said child.

14     The Court agreed that the Mother required the assistance of a domestic helper to assist her to care for the said child so that the Mother could continue to work. The Court also assessed that it was in the best interests of the welfare of the said child that the said child attends child care so as to enhance the said child’s socialisation skills (bearing in mind that the said child was being assessed for autism) by regular interaction with other children of the same age.

15     As such, the Court assessed that the Father’s share of the said child’s educational expenses, including child care costs, should be at ½ liability on a reimbursement basis so that this was not a fixed sum each month and that the Mother should bear equal responsibility for the said child’s educational needs.

16     The Court therefore ordered that the Father should be liable for the said child’s current child care costs, which was $992.50 **rounded to $992.00** (being 50% of $1,985.00) and 50% of the said child’s future education and education-related expenses within 14 days of the production of receipts for such expenses. The Court further provided that the Mother was not to sign up the said child at any school or for any tuition/enrichment classes without the Father’s prior consent which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

17     For the said child’s medical and dental expenses, the Court also put this in a separate provision because this was another variable expense. The Court was of the view that the Father should also be liable for ½ of the said child’s medical and dental expenses, on a reimbursement basis. However, the Court provided that the Father’s liability should only be for treatment at government hospitals/clinics and that the said child’s medical insurance should be utilised at the maximum allowable first. If private medical treatment was required, the Court provided that the Father’s prior consent be first obtained before he would also be liable for ½ of these expenses.

18     With regard to the third area on the pre and post-natal expenses incurred by the Mother, in her Affidavit dated 4 August 2017[^3], the Mother had claimed the sum of $23,677.71 at 80% of the costs of her pre and post-natal expenses of $28,113.86. The Court noted that the Father had, in his Affidavit filed on 12 April 2019, agreed to make payment of the sum of $15,321.84 as previously ordered in the 16 November 2017 Court Order. The Father had also made a proposal for payment of this sum by instalments over 16 months at $957.615 per month.

19     The Court further noted that the Mother was agreeable to this proposal but that she wanted the payment to commence from the date of the Court’s decision i.e. from 31 May 2019. The Court was of the view that both the proposed sum and the Father’s proposal for instalment payments over 16 months was fair and reasonable but that it should take effect from 1 July 2019 so as to give the Father some time to make the arrangements for these payments. The Court also rounded off the payments at $958.00 per month and ordered accordingly.

20     The Court noted that with regard to the costs of the baby items also being claimed by the Mother in the sum of $4,964.09, the Father had also made a proposal of payment in the total sum of $500.00 to be paid by instalments over 2 months being at $250 per month. However, the Mother rejected this offer.

21     The Court was of the view that unlike the expenditure incurred by the Mother for the pre and post-natal expenses for the said child as the birth took place at the \[C\] Hospital, which was an argument raised by the Father, the baby items were costs incurred by the Mother as necessary expenditure for the said child no matter which hospital the birth took place.

22     The Court was therefore of the view that the Father’s liability for these baby items should be on an equal basis with the Mother. Hence, the Court ordered that the Father was to pay the sum of $2,482.045 (being 50% of $4,964.09) which was spread out over 12 instalments in the sum of $206.83 rounded to $207 per instalment each month also with effect from 1 July 2019.

23     The Court also dealt with the Mother’s bank account details (Paragraph 7 of the said Court Order) and the Penal Notice Clause of the said 16 November 2017 Court Order as these were consequential to the 3 clauses that were being re-heard. The Father did not object and in fact confirmed that he understood these were the issues for the re-hearing[^4].

24     At the conclusion of the first day of hearing, the Father informed that he had no issue[^5] with regard to Paragraph 7 on the Mother’s bank account details but challenged the need for the inclusion of the Penal Notice. However, the Father has not appealed against this part of the said Court Order but instead appealed against Paragraph 8 of the said Court Order which provided for ‘Liberty to Apply’. This provision is usually added so to allow the Parties to seek variation and further orders should the provisions of the current order be not workable.

25     Finally, with regard to the Father’s ability to pay, the Court considered the Father’s submission that even with the combined income of his Wife, their monthly expenses were about $2,500.00 whereas their combined income was about $2,760.00. The Father also submitted that he was currently only taking home $960.00 per month as he was working as an Administrator at \[D\] Private Limited. The Father further submitted that he was trying to apply for a 2nd job but he was not very qualified and had only graduated with a Diploma[^6].

26     At the first hearing date on 22 March 2019, the Father produced a letter of termination dated 4 January 2019[^7] which the Mother’s Counsel challenged and for which the Court directed that the Father was to explain in a further Affidavit. The Court also directed that the Father was to state whether he owned any residential properties in Singapore or abroad and his share for these properties as to whether they were being held solely by him or with other parties. The Father duly filed his further Affidavit on 12 April 2019.

27     However, at the second hearing date on 8 May 2019, the Court noted that the said letter of termination of employment dated 4 January 2019, referred to 5 addresses when the Father’s ownership in only one property had previously been revealed to the Court, namely the property at \[Address Redacted\]. As such, the Court queried why these other 4 addresses had been included in the said letter[^8]. The Court repeated its request for the Father to explain whether he owned or had any property rights, title or interests in these other 4 addresses.

28     By way of his final Affidavit filed on 16 May 2019, the Father stated at paragraph 5 thereof, that “_he was the sole or part owner of four of the addresses found in the five letters of termination_”. However, even up to the date of the Court’s decision for this case[^9], the Father still failed to provide the requested details of his ownership, rights or title in these 4 other properties.

29     In addition, the Mother’s Counsel had submitted that in the Father’s Affidavit dated 26 December 2018, the Father had disclosed that he had take-home income of $3,200.00 per month. In contrast, regarding the Mother’s application for Discovery and Interrogatories, the Father had disclosed that he was earning income of $1,200.00 from two companies. However, in his Affidavit dated 14 March 2019, the Father stated that he was only earning income of $1,200.00 from \[D\] Private Limited with the take home salary of $960.00. The Mother’s Counsel had submitted that this showed that the Father might have other bank accounts that had not been exhibited[^10].

30     The Court agreed with the Mother’s Counsel that adverse inference should be drawn against the Father in that he could be having more financial means than he was disclosing. The Court also drew adverse inference against the Father for his failure to explain or provide the requested details of his ownership, rights or title in the 4 other properties listed in the letter of termination of employment dated 4 January 2019, despite being given several opportunities by the Court to do so.

31     The Court also took note of the Mother’s current situation in that the Mother had, at the time of the hearing in March 2019, just been served with a termination letter. Having been informed of this, the Father submitted that the Mother had better financial means than had been disclosed. The Father also disclosed that he was still in debt to the Mother for a loan taken from her in the sum of $350,000.00[^11].

32     In the Court’s view, the loan which the Father had taken from the Mother was a separate issue not before the Court. The Court made its orders accordingly on the Mother’s application.
