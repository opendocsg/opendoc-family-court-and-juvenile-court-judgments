Ancillary matters

30 December 2019

### District Judge Guy Ghazali:

## Introduction

1       The parties to these proceedings (“the Parties”) married on 8 July 2006. Before the marriage, the Parties had been living together for about two years from 2004. At that time, the Defendant-Husband (“the Husband”) was still legally married to his former wife. Divorce proceedings between the Husband and his former wife concluded some time in 2006 (before the Parties’ marriage).

2       The Parties have one daughter, \[B\]. \[B\] is 10 years old this year.

3       The Plaintiff-Wife (“the Wife”) has another daughter, \[C\], from her previous marriage. \[C\] is 21 years old this year and was already 21 years at the time of the ancillary matters hearing.

4       The Husband has three children from his two previous marriages. One of the children, \[P\], male, 39 years old, holds two properties in joint names with the Husband. The two properties are the Parties’ landed matrimonial home (“Property Y”) and a condominium unit (“Property H”).

5       The Wife filed the Writ for Divorce on 5 September 2017.

6       The court granted an Interim Judgment on 26 February 2018 on the Wife’s Statement of Claim and the Husband’s Counterclaim. Both parties relied on the other party’s unreasonable behaviour as the basis for divorce.

7       As at the date of the Interim Judgment, the parties had been married for 11 years and 7 months.

8       The Interim Judgment also contains consent orders with regard to \[B\]. It is not necessary for me to reproduce those orders herein, save to note that the Wife has care and control of \[B\].

9       Given that the issues of custody, care and control, and access have been resolved in the Interim Judgment, the remaining issues for determination in the ancillary matters hearing are the division of the matrimonial assets (including the matrimonial home), maintenance of the Wife and maintenance of \[B\].

10     At the time of the ancillary matters hearing, there was a subsisting maintenance order for the Wife and \[B\] (“the Subsisting Maintenance Order”). The Subsisting Maintenance Order was a variation of a previous maintenance order that also made provisions for \[C\]. Under the Subsisting Maintenance Order, \[C\] was excluded as she had attained the age of 21 years. Under the Subsisting Maintenance Order, the Husband is to pay the Wife a sum of $1,335.00 per month ($667.50 for the Wife and $667.50 for \[B\]) on the 2nd day of each month. The Husband is to pay a further sum of $300.00 per month for \[B\]’s tuition expenses. Additionally, the Husband is to bear the household bills in respect of Property Y, \[B\]’s medical and hospital bills as well as the Wife’s hospital bills.

11     In the interest of completeness, I would add that in the Wife’s written submissions for the ancillary matters hearing, the Wife has sought an order for the maintenance of \[C\]. However, as section 122 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353) (“WC”) defines “child” as a child of the marriage who is below the age of 21 years, this court does not have the power to make a maintenance order for \[C\] in the ancillary matters hearing under section 127 of the WC as \[C\] is already 21 years old. \[C\] is however not precluded from applying for maintenance in a separate proceeding under Part VIII of the WC.

12     There were also issues relating to third party interests, which have since been resolved in a separate High Court suit. These issues relate to Property Y and Property H, which are in the joint names of the Husband and his son, \[P\]. Pursuant to the events that have transpired in the High Court suit, both parties now accept that the Husband has a 100% beneficial interest in Property Y and a 20% beneficial interest in Property H.

13     After having heard both Counsel and considering the evidence, my ancillary matters orders are as follows:

> (1)     Pursuant to section 112 of the WC, the Husband shall pay the Wife a total sum of $931,708.45 in the following manner:

>> (i)       an initial sum of $31,708.45 is to be paid within one month from the order, namely, by 4 November 2019;

>> (ii)       a further sum of $50,000 is to be paid within three months from the order, namely, by 4 January 2020;

>> (iii)       the remaining sum of $850,000 is to be paid within six months of the order, namely, by 4 April 2020.

> (2)     The Wife shall vacate the matrimonial home (Property Y) upon receipt of full payment of the sum of $931,708.45 or on a date as may be mutually agreed by the parties.

> (3)     Save as set out above, the Parties shall retain assets in their respective names.

> (4)     The Husband shall pay the Wife maintenance for \[B\], as follows:

>> (i)       While \[B\] is residing at the matrimonial home (Property Y), the Subsisting Maintenance Order shall continue to apply in respect of \[B\]. For the avoidance of doubt, the Husband shall continue to pay the household bills in respect of Property Y.

>> (ii)       After \[B\] moves out from the matrimonial home (Property Y), the Husband shall pay the Wife a sum of $1,200 per month for the maintenance of \[B\] on the 2nd day of the month. In addition, the Husband shall bear \[B\]’s hospitalisation expenses.

>> (iii)       Payments shall be made into the Wife’s designated bank account.

> (5)     There shall be no maintenance for the Wife.

> (6)     Each party shall bear his/her own costs.

14     Both parties have filed appeals against the whole of my orders.

15     I set out below the reasons for my decision.

## Assets asserted to be matrimonial assets

16     The assets that the Parties have asserted to be matrimonial assets can be categorised as follows:

> (1)     the matrimonial home at Property Y;

> (2)     the Husband’s 20% beneficial interest in Property H;

> (3)     a unit in a residential building in Changchun, China (“the Changchun property”);

> (4)     the monies in the Husband’s Central Provident Fund (CPF) account totalling $87,732.68 (comprising $155.00 in the Ordinary Account, $50,849.39 in the Medisave Account, $110.97 in the Special Account and $36,617.32 in the Retirement Account); and

> (5)     the value of the Husband’s shares in his Central Depository (Pte) Limited (CDP) account amounting to $281,467.40.

17     The Husband objects to the inclusion of Property Y and Property H in the matrimonial pool while the Wife objects to the inclusion of the Changchun property. Save for the assets listed at \[16\], both counsel have confirmed at the ancillary matters hearing that there is no other asset asserted to be matrimonial assets.

##### (i) Property Y

18     It is undisputed that Property Y is the Parties’ matrimonial home and has been the Parties’ matrimonial home since the completion of its purchase in 2007.

19     The Husband entered into an agreement to purchase Property Y on 25 September 2006, after the Parties’ marriage. Property Y was registered in the names of the Husband and \[P\] on 9 May 2007 and remains registered in their names.

20     It is the Husband’s case that he had used the sale proceeds from two pre-marital assets, namely, Property B (a landed house) and Property M (a condominium unit) to fund the purchase of Property Y. The Husband has produced completion accounts to show that Property M and Property B were sold in January 2007 and February 2007 respectively. The Husband received a sum of $735,081.38 from the sale of Property M and a sum of $836,822.25 from the sale of Property B.

21     Prior to moving to Property Y, the Parties lived at Property M (before the marriage) and thereafter at Property B (at the time of the marriage and until Property B was sold). In between moving from Property B to Property Y, the Parties put up temporarily at the Husband’s sister’s house.

22     Property Y is fully paid-up. The Parties disagree on the valuation of Property Y. I have adopted the Husband’s value of $3.5 million as it is supported by a valuation report.

##### (ii) Property H

23     Property H was purchased in July 2010 for $1,260,340. Property H is registered in the names of the Husband and \[P\]. According to the affidavit evidence of both the Husband and \[P\], the down payment for the purchase of Property H was paid for by the Husband but the down payment amount was thereafter repaid by \[P\] to the Husband. Addionally, a bank loan of $1,008,272 was taken to fund the purchase of Property H. Loan repayment is being paid for by \[P\].

24     The net value of Property H is agreed at $766,905. Parties agree that the Husband only has a 20% beneficial interest in Property H, which works out to $153,381.

##### (iii) The document dated 5 July 2006 (“the 5 July 2006 Document”)

25     Before I move on to the other assets, I will deal first with the 5 July 2006 Document.

26     The 5 July 2006 Document is relevant because it is the Husband’s counsel’s submissions at the ancillary matters hearing that the 5 July 2006 Document has the effect of excluding Property Y and Property H from division.

27     I note however that while it is the Husband’s position on affidavit that he used the sale proceeeds from Property B and Property M to purchase Property Y, he does not take the same position in respect of Property H. It is not the Husband’s position on affidavit that he used the funds from the sale of Property B and Property M to pay for Property H. On the contrary, it is his position that the payment that he made towards the down payment of Property H (and no mention is made as to the source of these monies) has been repaid by \[P\].

28     As such, taking the Husband’s counsel’s submission at its highest, the 5 July 2006 Document only applies to Property Y and not Property H. As such, there is no basis to exclude the Husband’s 20% share in Property H from the division of matrimonial assets.

29     With regard to the 5 July 2006 Document, the original document is in the Chinese language and handwritten by the Husband. To assist the court and in accordance with the rules, both parties have provided certified translations of the 5 July 2006 Document.

30     I reproduce below the Parties’ certified translations of the 5 July 2006 Document. While the two translations are not identical, both counsel agree that they are similar in substance.

31     It is noted that whilst the 5 July 2006 Document made reference to Property B and Property M, it made no reference to Property Y, which had not been purchased at that time. It is the Husband’s contention that because the purchase of Property Y was funded by the sale proceeds of Property B and Property M, Property Y should be precluded from the division of matrimonial assets.

32     Based on the Wife’s certified translation that has been provided to the court, it is stated in the 5 July 2006 Document that the Wife “will not get involved” in the “net worth or outstanding liabilities” in respect of Property B and Property M or in other terms (as provided by the Husband’s alternative certified translation), the Wife shall not “pursue or demand” the “net value” of Property B and Property M and “any arrears has nothing to do” with the Wife. In simple terms, this part can be construed to mean that the Wife shall not have an interest in Property B and Property M and shall not be liable for any liabilities in respect of these two properties.

33     According to the Wife, she signed the 5 July 2006 Document a day before the marriage on 7 July 2006. The Husband did not discuss the contents of the document with her. She also had no opportunity to seek legal or other form of advice in respect of the 5 July 2006 Document. She was told by the Husband that the 5 July 2006 Document was in her interest as it contained the Husband’s promise to provide for her child, \[C\]. It is the Wife’s position that she signed the 5 July 2006 Document without understanding its implications. It is also the Wife’s contention that the Husband did not fulfil the terms of the 5 July 2006 Document. For instance, the Husband did not include her name as a joint owner of the Xiamen property. Instead, the Xiamen property was sold without her name being added as a joint owner. As for the Nan’an Shijing property, while it was sold, the sale proceeds were retained by the Husband and not used to pay for a condominium in China. The Husband did not purchase a new condominium in China for the Parties’ co-owning. Neither did he purchase a 4-room HDB flat for the Wife nor made provisions for \[C\] in his Will.

34     At this juncture, I reiterate that the 5 July 2006 Document was signed at a time when Property Y had not been purchased as the agreement to purchase Property Y was only signed in September 2006. Also, at that time, the Parties have not had their child, \[B\].

35     One of the factors that the court has to consider when determining the division of matrimonial assets under s112 WC is “any agreement between the parties with respect to ownership and division of the matrimonial assets made in contemplation of divorce” (s 112(2)(e)). The agreement that is to be taken into consideration can be either pre-nuptial or post-nuptial. However, what is critical is that the agreement must be made “in contemplation of divorce”.

36     In this regard, the Court of Appeal case of _Lian Hwee Choo, Phebe v Tan Seng Ong_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGCA 37</span> is instructive. The Court of Appeal explained at \[21\]:

> _“21_.     _It follows from the foregoing that there can be two types of agreement within the meaning of s112(2)(e) of the Charter:_

>> (_a_)     _If an agreement is entered into for the purpose of dividing the assets in the context of a specifically contemplated divorce, that will be an agreement within the meaning of s 112(2)(e) for the purpose of that divorce; but, if for some reason the divorce does not ensue at that time and the parties reconcile and carry on, then that agreement can have no relevance in the event of a later divorce._

>> (_b_)     _On the other hand, if an agreement is a definitive one for the division of assets in the event of a divorce (whenever that might happen and even though it may not be specifically envisaged at the time of the agreement (as in the case in a prenuptial agreement)), the evidence must show that the agreement was intended to have such an effect. If such intention is proven, as it was in TQ v TR, then that agreement would be admissible under s 112(2)(e).”_

37     With regard to scenario (b), the Court of Appeal went on to elaborate that the necessary intention may be _“explicitly stated in a written agreement signed by the parties or clearly inferable from the language of such agreement”_ or where _“specific reference to divorce”_ is _not_ made in the written agreement, _“a detailed analysis of the facts would have to be undertaken by the court to determine whether the agreement arrived at by the parties was intended to govern what would happen to the matrimonial assets in the event of a divorce”_.

38     I note that the 5 July 2006 Document did not contain specific reference to a divorce. Looking at the contents of the 5 July 2006 Document in totality, I am not satisfied that the said document is an agreement made “in contemplation of divorce”. Instead, in my view, it is a document regulating or prescribing the primary financial expectations of the Parties when they become a married couple such as how properties will be held, acquired and funded, how the Husband will be maintaining the Wife and her child, \[C\], the source of these funds and matters relating to succession planning. It appears to this court that the 5 July 2006 Document represents a commitment by the Husband to perform certain acts during the marriage save that the Parties are not to interfere with each other’s dealings in respect of certain specified assets. Even if the Husband intended for the 5 July 2006 Document to be “in contemplation of divorce”, which intention is not borne out in evidence, such intention, if any, cannot be said to be mutual. Critically, it is noted that the 5 July 2006 Document did not make reference to Property Y (which became the Parties’ matrimonial home) or addressed how assets that would be acquired from the sale proceeds of Property B and Property M ought to be treated _in the event of a divorce_.

39     In the circumstances, I am of the view that the 5 July 2006 Document is not an agreement within the scope of s 112(2)(e) WC. I have accordingly included the Husband’s 100% share in Property Y in the matrimonial pool.

##### (iv) The Changchun property

40     The Changchun property is a disputed matrimonial asset. It is the Husband’s position that the Changchun property is a matrimonial asset as the Changchun property was purchased from the sale proceeds of his Xiamen property. The Wife takes the position that the Changchun property is not a matrimonial asset as it was a gift for her father.

41     The Changchun property was first held in the Wife’s name as the Wife’s father was not a resident in the city. The Changchun property was transferred to the name of the Wife’s father about five years ago.

42     On affidavit (the Husband’s affidavit dated 18 July 2019 at \[12\]), the Husband conceded that he gave the Wife a sum of $186,000 (equivalent to RMB 932,000) _“to buy a condominium for her parents in her hometown in Chang Chun city, registered in her sole name”_.

43     In light of the Husband’s concession in affidavit that the property was bought for the Wife’s parents, I accept the Wife’s position that the Changchun property was a gift by the Husband to her parents and that it should be excluded from the matrimonial pool.

##### (v) The Husband’s CPF monies and CDP shares

44     Both parties agree that the Husband’s CPF monies and CDP shares are matrimonial assets. The values of these assets are also agreed.

## Division of the matrimonial assets

45     The gross value of the matrimonial pool is $4,022,581.08. A breakdown is set out below.

46     Parties have agreed to deduct the amount of the overdraft that is in the Husband’s name, agreed at $295,747.28, from the matrimonial pool. The net value of the matrimonial pool that is available for division is therefore $3,726,833.80.

47     It is not disputed between the Parties that the direct financial contributions are solely made by the Husband.

48     This is a single income marriage where the Husband is the sole breadwinner while the Wife is a homemaker. As this is a single income marriage, I do not have to apply the structured approach in _ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span> (“ANJ”). Having said that, the structured approach in _ANJ_ is still valuable to provide guidance in this case, given that this case is not a single income _long_ marriage as contemplated in _TNL v TNK_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 15</span> which would justify an equal division of the matrimonial assets. In the present case, the marriage is about 12 years or specifically 11 years and 7 months. Taking into account the facts of this case including the length of the marriage, the financial and non-financial contributions of the parties (the Wife being the primary caregiver for \[B\] and \[C\], the latter whom the Husband has accepted to be a member of the family), the size of the matrimonial pool, that the Husband has accepted and financially provided for \[C\] who is the Wife’s child from her previous marriage (and this contribution goes towards the Husband) and considering that the Husband already had the financial means when the Parties entered into the marriage (as opposed to the family’s wealth being built in the course of the marriage), I am of the view that it is just and equitable to award the Wife 25% of the net value of the matrimonial assets. This works out to $931,708.45. For the avoidance of doubt, I would have arrived at the same percentage even if I had applied the _ANJ_ structured approach.

49     The sum of $931,708.45 shall be paid in three instalments as follows:

> (i)     an initial sum of $31,708.45 to be paid within one month from the date of this order, namely, by 4 November 2019;

> (ii)     a further sum of $50,000 to be paid within three months from the date of this order, namely, by 4 January 2020;

> (iii)     the remaining sum of $850,000 to be paid within six months from the date of this order, namely, by 4 April 2020.

50     The Wife shall vacate the matrimonial home at Property Y upon receipt of the full payment of the sum of $931,708.45 or on a date as may be mutually agreed by the Parties.

51     Save as set out above, the Parties shall retain assets in their respective names.

## Maintenance for the wife

52     The Wife has asked for maintenance in the sum of $2,200 per month for 12 months and thereafter a sum of $1,200 per month. She has not worked since moving to Singapore from China in 2004. The Wife is now a Singapore citizen. She is 45 years old. The Husband is 64 years old and retired.

53     Under my orders for division of assets, the Wife is receiving cash in the sum of $931,708.45, which she will receive in full by April 2020. If viewed with my orders for the maintenance of \[B\] below, the Wife is entitled to reside in the matrimonial home until she receives full payment and until then the household expenses will be borne by the Husband. The amount that the Wife will be receiving will enable the Wife to source for or purchase alternative accommodation with a significant balance to sustain herself while finding employment and/or to supplement her income.

54     In light of my order for division of matrimonial assets, the age of the Wife and her ability to earn some income, I made no order as to the maintenance of the Wife.

## Maintenance for the child of the marriage, \[B\]

55     As for \[B\]’s maintenance, there is the Subsisting Maintenance Order which requires the Husband to pay a total sum of $967.50 for \[B\], including a sum of $300 for tuition. The Husband is also required to pay for the household bills and \[B\]’s medical and hospitalisation bills.

56     My orders on \[B\]’s maintenance are as follows:

> (i)     While \[B\] is residing at the matrimonial home (Property Y), the Subsisting Maintenance Order shall continue to apply in respect of \[B\]. For the avoidance of doubt, the Husband shall continue to pay the household bills in respect of Property Y.

> (ii)     After \[B\] moves out from the matrimonial home (Property Y), the Husband shall pay the Wife a sum of $1,200 per month for the maintenance of \[B\] on the 2nd day of the month. In addition, the Husband shall bear \[B\]’s hospitalisation expenses.

> (iii)     Payments shall be made into the Wife’s designated bank account.

57     My reasons for the above orders are as follows:

> (i)     As long as \[B\] continues to reside in the matrimonial home, I do not find any reason to disturb the Subsisting Maintenance Order that was made as recent as March this year (about seven (7) months before my ancillary matters orders).

> (ii)     Only after \[B\] moves out from the matrimonial home (at the time when the Wife moves out), I am adjusting the maintenance order to $1,200 (from $967.50, inclusive of tuition) to take into account \[B\]’s share of the estimated household bills that the new household (constituting the Wife, \[B\] and \[C\]) will be incurring. In this regard, the Wife has estimated the household expenses to be $634 per month, as follows:

> On the basis of the Wife’s above calculation, \[B\]’s pro-rated share is $211.33. However, I am of the view that \[B\]’s share of the reasonable household expenses are not more than $180 per month.

> (iii)     In the adjusted maintenance order, I have also incorporated reasonable medical expense into the monthly sum so that payment for medical bills do not have to exist as a separate item. I have however retained the separate item for hospitalisation expenses.

## Costs

58     Neither party has sought costs. In the circumstances, I have ordered for each party to bear his/her own costs, which I consider to be appropriate.
