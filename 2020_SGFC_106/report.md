Variation of Maintenance for Children – Variation of Order for Division of Matrimonial Assets

17 December 2020

### District Judge Goh Zhuo Neng:

## A.   INTRODUCTION

1       This was an application (“**Application**”) filed by the Defendant Father (“**Father**”) against the Plaintiff Mother (“**Mother**”) to vary the terms of an ancillary order dated 3 August 2015 (“**Order**”) that had been varied by a consent order dated 20 March 2018 (“**Consent Order**”). The Order had been made by the High Court pursuant to an appeal against the decision of the lower court made on 13 March 2015. The Application was filed on 13 December 2019.

2       In summary, the relief sought by the Father in the Application was:

> a)     That the Father’s share of the maintenance for the 3 children of the family (“**Children**”) be reduced from $16,600 to $12,000 per month with effect from 1 August 2019. The Children were aged 20, 18, and 13 (“**Child A**”, “**B**”, “**C**” respectively) as of the date of the Application was heard.

> b)     That “excess amounts” paid by the Father in relation to Child A’s maintenance as a result of the variation be offset against his future maintenance payments for the Children.

> c)     That the payment of US$500,000 to be made by the Father to the Mother for her share of a matrimonial property in Bali be made conditional on the sale of the matrimonial property at US$2,000,000. If the property is sold for less than US$2,000,000, the Mother would receive 40% of the sales proceeds less any legal fees expended by the Father to secure payment of the proceeds.

> d)     If the Father has paid any amounts to the Mother in connection with the anticipated collection of the sale proceeds in (c), these payments shall be applied towards the payment of the Father’s child maintenance obligations.

3       On 3 April 2020, I heard the Application. The Mother was represented by counsel and the Father acted in person. I ordered that from the months of October 2019 to April 2020 (both months inclusive), the Father would pay a reduced maintenance for the Children of $12,000.00. All other prayers were dismissed and I ordered that there would be no order as to costs.

4       The Mother and Father filed their Notices of Appeal respectively on 18 September 2020 and 23 September 2020 against my decision, having obtained leave of Court to file these Notices out of time. The Mother’s appeal is against my decision to reduce the maintenance for the Children. The Father’s appeal is against all of my decision. The full grounds of my decision are set out below.

## B.   VARIATION OF CHILD MAINTENANCE

5       The Father was seeking two orders in relation to child maintenance:

> a)     That the Father’s share of the maintenance for the 3 children of the family (“**Children**”) be reduced from $16,600 to $12,000 per month. This was on the basis that the Father had lost his job, and that the Children’s reasonable expenses should be lowered. He was seeking a reduction with effect from October 2019 as his last day of work was 20 September 2019.

> b)     That “excess amounts” paid by the Father in relation to Child A be offset against his future maintenance payments for the Children. This was on the basis that Child A had taken a year’s break from university from August 2018 to 2019 and lived with the Father.

6       The orders relating to child maintenance were part of the Order and not varied by the Consent Order.

#### I.    The Law

7       Under section 127(2) of the Women’s Charter read with section 72(1) of the Women’s Charter, the Court may at any time vary or rescind any subsisting order for child maintenance, where it is satisfied that there is a change in the circumstances of the person, his wife or the child, or for other good cause.

8       Section 72(2) of the Women’s Charter also states that without prejudice to the extent of the discretion conferred upon the Court by section 72(1), the Court in considering an application for variation, may also take into consideration any change in the general cost of living which may have occurred between the date of the making of the order sought to be varied and the date of the hearing of the application.

#### II.    Downward Variation of Child Maintenance

9       When the Order was made, the Court assessed the Children’s expenses to be $23,364 per month. The Father’s monthly income/earning capacity was assessed to be $47,000 a month, and the Mother’s at $19,000 a month. This worked out to be an income ratio of 71:29, with the Father paying the higher share of 71% which amounted to $16,600 a month.

10     The Father submitted that he had ceased working as a consultant for his previous client on 20 September 2019 due to disputes over his remuneration. While his role was structured as a consultancy agreement, he performed the role of Asia Pacific managing director for this client. On this dispute, the Father explained that up till June 2019, the terms of his remuneration were that he would receive a monthly retainer fee as well as a commission equal to about 10% of the revenue for deals closed by him after payments were collected. From June 2019, the Father’s remuneration became fully commission based.

11     From June 2018 to May 2019 and August 2019, the Father did not receive any of his commissions, even though he claimed they were due. After some negotiation, the Father was unable to reach a resolution with his previous client and he terminated his consultancy agreement with them on 20 September 2019.

12     The Mother submitted that the Father’s cessation of employment was self-induced as he had not been fired or made redundant. He should also have attempted to secure a better paid job before terminating his consultancy agreement. The case of _UWY v UWZ_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGFC 60</span> (“**_UWY_**”) was cited, where the Court dismissed a Father’s application for downward variation of maintenance on the basis that it was self-induced. In _UWY_, the Father claimed he was forced to resign from his job on the basis that he refused to relocate to India and the start-up he had founded was not doing well. The Court held that the Father’s explanation was inadequate as he had a pre-existing responsibility to fulfil his maintenance obligations and he also did not provide documentary evidence that he was forced to resign from his job.

13     The documentary evidence from the Father shows that as far back as 25 September 2018, the Father had been chasing his client for payment of outstanding commission. There had been no response from the client on this prior to the Father’s termination of their agreement on 20 September 2019. Given that the Father’s compensation had become fully commission based as of June 2019, there was a genuine concern on his part that his client’s failure to make good on his commission payments would drastically affect his remuneration going forward. Therefore, I found that this was not a self-induced departure.

14     Following his termination of the agreement, the Father begin searching for a job. Eventually he found employment on a one-year contact effective from March 2020 to March 2021, with his first month of pay coming on 25th April 2020. The Father’s remuneration under this contract was $30,000 per month, with a car allowance of $1,500 and a performance bonus of $180,000. This came up to an annual total of $558,000 – about $46,500 a month – not far off from his assessed income capacity of $47,000 when the Order was made.

15     The Father submitted that the performance bonus was subject to targets and should not be regarded as being a certainty. I found that this would not affect my assessment that the Father’s income capacity had changed as he was used to having a considerable part of his remuneration being paid on a commission basis.

16     There was also a further argument that the Children’s reasonable expenses should be lower and therefore the Father’s 71% share should reflect this. He claimed that the Mother had not been transparent in her calculations of maintenance for the Children when the Order was made, and proposed his own assessment of what amounted to the reasonable monthly expenses of the Children – to be reduced from $23,364 to $17,000. His 71% share of this was $12,000.

17     I was not persuaded by this argument. The Order had clearly provided that what were the reasonable expenses of the Children. They formed the basis of the assessed maintenance paid by the Father that the Mother would have full discretion to use. It was not for the Father to impose a unilateral and retrospective review of these expenses on her. To do so meant there would be no finality to any maintenance order made and the Mother would not be able to budget or plan her expenses for the Children for the foreseeable future.

18     On the facts, I did not feel that it was necessary to prospectively reduce the child maintenance paid by the Father. However, it was not possible to ignore the fact that he was unemployed from 20 September 2020 to March 2020. This was a considerable period of unemployment, and it was clear from the evidence that the Father had been working hard to find a role that would enable him to continue paying the maintenance. His bank balances over this period were depleted considerably and he had to redeem an insurance benefit policy to pay maintenance.

19     The Mother submitted that the Father should have obtained a job before terminating his consultancy agreement on 20 September 2020. I noted that this might not have been a viable option for the Father. He was hoping to resolve the dispute with his client, and the negotiations might be affected if his job search became known.

20     In the circumstances, I granted a variation for a limited period. The child maintenance from October 2019 to April 2020 (both months inclusive) would be reduced to $12,000. The Father had no income during this period so I would allow his prayers for reduction to $12,000 to stand during this period. This struck a fair balance as the Father would still be obliged to pay maintenance (albeit a reduced sum) while he remained without income. The Children would just have to adjust their expenses during this period. The Father would start paying child maintenance of $16,600 a month from 1 May 2020 onwards, as he would only get his first pay-check in April 2020.

#### III.    Excess Payments allegedly paid by the Father (Under Reimbursements for Child A’s expenses)

21     The Father explained that Child A had lived with the Father from July 2015 to July 2019, while Child B and C lived with the Mother. The parties had an arrangement where the Mother would reimburse the Father a specific amount each month on account of Child A living with the Father. This continued even after the Order was made in August 2015.

22     The amounts reimbursed to the Father continued to be paid up to July 2019, as Child A left for university in August 2019.

> a)     July 2015 through December 2015 – a total of $9,540.00.

> b)     January 2016 to February 2016 - $850.00 a month.

> c)     March 2016 to September 2016 - $1,565 a month.

> d)     October 2016 to July 2019 - $2,045 a month.

23     The Father submitted that over the years, he had been under-reimbursed by the Mother and was seeking repayment of the sum of $17,565.30.

24     I did not accept that this amounted to a change of circumstances which would justify a variation or reimbursement to the Father. The Order had been made on August 2015, and the High Court in doing so had taken into account arguments from the Father’s counsel that Child A had been living with the Father since July 2015. If the Father had chosen not to appeal against the decision of the High Court in respect of the assessed maintenance, then it would not be appropriate for him to seek a backdoor and belated appeal against this decision by filing a variation in December 2019.

#### IV.    Excess Payments allegedly paid by the Father (Child A’s Gap Year)

25     The Father claimed that from August 2018 to July 2019, Child A ceased attending international school and took a year’s break before leaving for university in August 2019 (“**Gap Year**”). As a result, the expenses of Child A were reduced, and the Father claims he ended up paying an excess amount of $17,003.13 over this period.

26     In my view, the Father was not entitled to seek a reimbursement over this period. Even on his best case, and it can be proven that changes in the expenses caused the Father to pay an excess amount to the Mother of $17,003.13, this sum would have been matched by the amounts reimbursed to him by the Mother from January 2016 to July 2018. These monthly payments from the Mother which begin from January 2016, amounted to $51,510.

> a)     January 2016 to February 2016 - $850.00 a month - $1,700.00.

> b)     March 2016 to September 2016 - $1,565 a month - $10,955.

> c)     October 2016 to July 2018 - $2,045 a month - $38,855.

27     It would not be fair to the Mother if these payments were to be disregarded simply because she had paid them out of her own goodwill. All circumstances should take into account and having received these payments, it was not fair for the Father to be reimbursed for changes in the expenses that had occurred during the Gap Year.

## C.   VARIATION OF THE DIVISION OF MATRIMONIAL ASSETS

28     Under the Order, as part of the division of the Father was ordered to pay the Mother the sum of US$500,000 for her share of a villa in Bali, known as Bali Villa No.8 (“**BV8**”). This payment was supposed to have been made by 13 September 2015. By the Consent Order dated 30 March 2018, the mode of payment was varied to provide that the Father would pay the Mother monthly instalments of US$5,000 until the sum of US$500,000 was fully paid. As of 24 March 2020, the Father had paid the Mother US$353,000 in respect of BV8.

29     The Father submitted that the payment of the US$500,000 should be varied as follows:

> a)     That the payment of US$500,000 be made conditional on the sale of BV8 at US$2,000,000. If BV8 is sold for less than US$2,000,000, the Mother would receive 40% of the sales proceeds less any legal fees expended by the Father to secure payment of the proceeds.

> b)     If the Father paid any amounts to the Mother in connection with the anticipated collection of the sale proceeds of BV8, these payments shall be applied towards the payment of the Father’s child maintenance obligations.

30     This was on the basis of the following arguments:

> a)     The Father never had legal ownership of BV8 and subsequently never had the legal ability to compel the sale of BV8.

> b)     The Father’s right to collect the sale proceeds of BV8 was contingent on him being able to enforce agreements between himself and the parties entitled to those monies. These agreements were dated 18 July 2011 and 25 February 2013. He was still in the process of resolving a legal dispute in the Hong Kong courts to establish his claim to those monies. The legal fees in these proceedings were being borne solely by him.

> c)     The Father had been subject to duress when he entered into the Consent Order as the Mother had threatened to pursue her legal remedies in Court to enforce payment of the US$500,000. These remedies including commencing bankruptcy or garnishee proceedings against the Father.

31     The law imposes a very high threshold on the variation of order for the division of matrimonial assets under Section 112(4) of the Women’s Charter which provides that:

> _“The Court may at any time it thinks fit, extend, vary, revoke or discharge any order under this section, and may vary any term or condition upon or subject to which any such order has been made”._

32     In the case of _TYA v TYB_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1170</span>, the Court made the following findings:

> a)     If the order to be varied has been fully implemented, the Court does not have the power to vary, set aside or otherwise reopen the issues in that order, save in a case of fraud.

> b)     If the order has not been fully implemented, the Court will only vary the order where it is unworkable due to a lack of functionality of the order, or due to a fundamental misunderstanding at the time the order was made, or the order has become unworkable as a result of new circumstances that had changed the situation that to implement the order would be to implement something radically different from what was originally intended.

33     I took the view this was not a case where the order for division had been fully implemented, as the full sum of US$500,000 had not been paid. Therefore, I had to assess whether the Consent Order was unworkable. I found that on the facts, there was no basis for me to make a finding that the Consent Order was unworkable.

> a)     The Consent Order is essentially a payment plan for the obligation to pay US$500,000 under the Order.

> b)     When the Order was made, the Father’s counsel had made submissions to the High Court explaining the nature of the Father’s right to the sales proceeds of BV8. _These were the exact arguments being raised by the Father in this Application (at paragraphs 30(a), (b) above)_. It was clear that the High Court had considered his arguments when making the Order. There was no misunderstanding on the part of the High Court when that Order was made.

> c)     The Order was clearly functional and nothing had changed to affect the intention of the Order. The intention of the Order was for the Father to make payment to the Mother of US$500,000 in respect of her right to the sales proceeds of BV8 as a matrimonial asset and he had already made partial payment of this amount. He would then be left to take the risk and reward of pursuing his claim for the sales proceeds, which was still ongoing in Hong Kong.

34     In respect of the Father’s allegations of duress where the Consent Order was concerned, I was of the view that duress could not have been caused simply by the Mother’s insistence on enforcement of her legal rights. The effect of the Consent Order also benefited the Father who was permitted to repay the sum of US$500,000 in instalments.

## D.   CONCLUSION AND COSTS

35     For the foregoing reasons, I made the above orders. The Mother’s counsel submitted that the Father should pay costs, given the lack of merit to his submissions and the amount of work that had been generated as a result of this application. I took the view that an order for no order as to costs be made as while the Father had not succeeded in his application in relation to the payment of monies under BV8, the Father had partially succeeded in his application to vary the child maintenance.
