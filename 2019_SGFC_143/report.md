Family Law – Matrimonial assets - Division

20 December 2019

### District Judge Lo Wai Ping:

## Introduction

1       This case concerned a long marriage of about 36 years. The parties, both Singaporeans, were married in 1982 and they adopted a child in 1989 (“**Son**”). The Son is now in his thirties and he is their only child.

2       In 2018, the plaintiff (“**Wife**”) filed for divorce alleging that the marriage had broken down due to the unreasonable behaviour of the defendant (“**Husband**”). The Husband did not acknowledge service of the divorce papers on him and did not enter appearance in the divorce suit. As the divorce was uncontested, interim judgment for divorce (“**Interim Judgment**”) was granted on the Wife’s claim in June 2018. In November 2018, the Husband obtained legal aid and was represented by counsel for the ancillaries. The Wife had her own legal counsel from the start of the proceedings.

3       On 12 July 2019, after considering the parties’ affidavits and submissions, I was of the view that it was just and equitable that the parties’ pool of matrimonial assets be divided in the proportion of 74.5 (Wife) : 25.5 (Husband) and I so ordered. The pool of matrimonial assets included the parties’ existing matrimonial home (which was registered in the Wife’s sole name (the “**Existing Home**”), her jewellery and insurance monies, the parties’ respective CPF monies and monies in their bank accounts. To achieve the division and to allow the Wife to retain the Existing Home, I made the orders set out in **Annex A** to these grounds of decision.

4       There was no maintenance ordered for the Wife. There was no order as to costs and the parties were at liberty to apply.

5       The Wife appealed against my orders in relation to the division of the pool of matrimonial assets and I set out below my grounds of decision.

## Background Facts

6       Originally, the parties had each filed 2 affidavits - their affidavits of assets and means (“**AOMs**”) and their affidavits in reply to each other’s AOM (referred to as each party’s second affidavit). After the first hearing, with the Court’s leave and directions, further affidavits were filed by the parties to provide disclosure and explanations on certain items.

7       As mentioned above, the parties were married in 1982. 3 years later, in 1985, they bought their first home (a HDB maisonette) (“**First Home**”). In 1998, 13 years after the said purchase, the First Home was sold and the net proceeds from the sale of the First Home were shared equally between the two of them. The parties bought the Existing Home, a 5-room HDB flat in the same year and moved into it. They have been residing in the Existing Home for more than 20 years.

8       In 2019, when the ancillaries were heard, the Wife was 58 years old and the Husband was 63 years old and they were both still residing in the Existing Home.

9       The Wife worked as a teacher during the marriage. She was still teaching at the time of the hearing of the ancillaries and she was earning a good and stable income. Based on the Wife’s income tax assessment notices for the past 3 years, she earned an average gross monthly income of about $11,143.

10     As for the Husband, he was in the food business for the majority part of his marriage. From 1982 to 1992, he ran a food stall at Jurong Pioneer Road. From 1993 to 2015, he ran another food stall at the Tekka market (on a sublet-basis). He lost this stall in 2015 and since then, he has been doing various jobs including working as an Uber driver. At the time when he filed his AOM (in January 2019), he was working part-time as a stall assistant at a hawker centre earning an estimated monthly salary of $700 to $800. He was working part-time (3 to 4 times a week) as he had been suffering from certain pains and he had upcoming scope procedures to determine if an operation was required. Earlier in 2017, he had had an operation to remove his appendix. He submitted a memorandum from Tan Tock Seng Hospital (“**TTSH**”) dated 27 March 2019 addressed to its department of General Surgery. The TTSH memorandum stated that the Husband was being reviewed for the management of certain issues including specifically, spigelian hernia and noted that he was keen for intervention in view of “recurrent abdominal pain”.[^1]

## Parties’ positions on their contributions during their marriage

11     The Husband and Wife gave very different accounts of their respective contributions during their marriage.

12     In brief, the Wife’s evidence was that the Husband was an irresponsible and largely absent father and husband throughout their marriage who did not contribute a single cent towards the family’s expenses or to the purchase of both their matrimonial homes. She also claimed that they had to sell off the First Home in 1998 as the Husband was facing “severe and complicated financial problems” and was “heavily mired in debt” which “affected financially his credibility to buy an asset in his name” and hence, the burden fell on her to purchase the Existing Home in her sole name and provide a roof for the family. The Husband would also borrow money from her and not return any. She claimed that due to the “Husband’s negligence”, she had depleted her savings. She was also deprived of any future savings as the burden was on her to solely contribute towards the family’s needs.

13     The Husband’s evidence was that he had contributed to the family and towards their 2 matrimonial homes during their long marriage of 36 years. Briefly, his evidence was this:

> (a)     From 1981 to 1982, he was a scaffolding supervisor at a construction company. From 1982 to 2015 (about 33 years), he was in the food business. For the first 10 years of this period (1982 to 1992), he was running a food-stall at Jurong Pioneer Road, and for the next 22 years (1993 to 2015), he was running another food stall at Tekka market (on a sub-let basis). He denied that their First Home had been sold in 1998 because of his financial problems.

> (b)     According to him, the Wife had lived away from home from 1985 to 1989 (in her parents’ home and elsewhere) and had returned to live with him at their home only sometime in 1990. It should be noted that the First Home was purchased in 1985.

> (c)     In 1989, he decided to adopt a child (the Son) in Malaysia (Johore Bahru). For the adoption of the Son, he had to spend time and monies in Malaysia (MR5000) for the hospital and adoption fees and he then brought the Son back to Singapore in 1989 and filed for adoption. He paid about $3,000 for the adoption process in Singapore. He disputed the Wife’s claim that she had been the Son’s sole caregiver since his birth. She had only attended to the Son later in 1990 when the Son was comfortably in his care.

> (d)     In terms of financial provision, during the period from 1982 to 2015 (when he was running his food-stalls), he would give the Wife about $700 to $1500 per month (depending on his business). These monies were for the household and the family’s expenses including the Son and he left it to the Wife to manage these expenses.

> (e)     From 1982 to 2015 (before the Wife engaged a maid), he had also done the following for the family: marketing, cooking, repairs and handy work at home, putting up the Deepavali decorations over the years, cleaning the home, doing laundry for the family, and painting the home with his friend’s help.

> (f)     When he was working as an Uber driver after 2015, he was also sending the Wife to the primary school where she taught.

> (g)     Over the years, he struck 4-D several times and he gave the Wife a share of his winnings each time. Specifically, he recalled that on 1 occasion (in 1999), he won $15,000, and he gave the Wife $10,000 and kept the balance. On another occasion (in 2003), he won $9,000 and he gave $3,000 to Wife for the upkeep of the home and a sum of MR5000 was given (in Malaysia) for the offer of prayers for the Son.

> (h)     From the sale of the First Home, the parties had each received $137,000 as their share of the sale proceeds. From his share, he did contribute to the family and the home. Whilst he had invested $80,000 into his food business, he had also spent $15,000 taking the family (the Wife, his mother and his sister’s family) to India for a vacation and paid $30,000 towards the renovation of the Existing Home. He had paid the $30,000 to the Wife for her to pay the contractor.

> (i)     For the purchase of the Existing Home in 1998 (after the sale of the First Home), he had informed the Wife that he could pay for the Existing Home too but it was she who told him that her CPF and monies were sufficient and that she would pay for the Existing Home and that he should continue to pay for the food and groceries for the whole family. As such, it was by mutual agreement that she had paid for the Existing Home and he had been doing his part by paying for the household and family expenses since then (as summarised above in this paragraph) although the Wife denied that there was any such agreement between them.

## Submissions

14     At the end, the Wife submitted that in respect of the Existing Home, she should be entitled to retain the Existing Home with no consideration payable to the Husband. As for all the other assets, parties should also retain their respective assets held in their sole names. She was not seeking any spousal maintenance from the Husband.

15     The Husband, on the other hand, contended that he had, by his efforts, contributed to the family and their homes and he should be entitled to a share in the Existing Home. As for spousal maintenance, there should be no order as the Wife was entitled to a greater share of the matrimonial assets and was earning a much higher regular income than he was.

## Decision

#### Pool of Matrimonial assets and Valuation

16     The parties agreed that the pool of matrimonial assets for division was to be identified as at the date of the Interim Judgment (28 June 2018). There was no dispute on the Husband’s assets. It was agreed at the hearing in July 2019 that the Husband’s assets amounted to a total of $53,710.56 as shown in Table A at paragraph 46 below.

17     As for the Wife’s assets, she had originally stated in her AOM that apart from the Existing Home, she had only assets amounting to $87,763.68 (comprising monies in her bank account and her CPF monies) with liabilities as shown below:

18     For the reasons set out below, I found that the Wife had not been full and frank in listing out her assets at the start. In the course of the hearing and when directed by the Court to provide certain disclosures, the Wife acknowledged in her third affidavit that she had omitted to include the following assets:[^2]

> (a)     her CPF investments and CPF Life plan;

> (b)     her 2 AIA insurance policies; and

> (c)     her jewellery.

19     As for her liabilities arising from the loan she had taken from the Singapore Teacher’s Co-Op (“**ST Co-op**”), she also admitted that she had made an ‘error’ in that the said loan (of $50,000) was not obtained in 2015, but in actuality, in May 2017 - about 10 months before she filed for divorce in April 2018.

#### The Wife’s disclosed assets and liabilities at the July 2019 hearing

20     At the further hearing on 12 July 2019, with her latest disclosures, the Wife’s counsel then submitted that the total value of her CPF monies (including her liquidated CPF investments and her CPF Life plan) for inclusion into the matrimonial asset pool for division amounted to a sum of $250,976.79. This was a significant increase from the amount of $87,288.55 stated in her AOM. The value of $250,976.79 as computed by her counsel (and based on documents disclosed in her third affidavit) was accepted by the Husband’s counsel at the hearing.[^3]

21     As for the Wife’s POSB savings account, the monies in this account as at Interim Judgement were found to be a sum of $6,023.56 based on bank statements disclosed in her third affidavit. As such, I accepted this figure for the pool (and not the earlier sum of $475.03 as stated in the AOM filed by the Wife).

22     On the Wife’s 2 AIA insurance policies, based on the AIA documents disclosed in her third affidavit which stated that the surrender values of the 2 terminated policies were $543.18 and $14,003.17 (as of October 2018) and in the absence of any explanation on the loans mentioned in these documents, I accepted the submission of the Husband’s counsel that I should take the total surrender values of these two policies to be the sum of $14,546 (rounded up).

23     As for the Wife’s jewellery, she had disclosed in her third affidavit that she had jewellery in her possession and that they had been valued by the pawnshop _verbally_ at only $2,830 in total. However, the Wife also claimed earlier that she had bought these items from “mid-2018” with her own income and that they were worth more – about $10,000. However, she did not adduce any supporting evidence for any of her claims here. Counsel for the Husband submitted that based on the Wife’s own admission in her AOM that she had been buying jewellery at $500 per month, she should have at least (if one took a period of only 12 months) $6,000 worth of jewellery in her possession. Having considered the above, I found it reasonable to ascribe a mid-point value of $5,000 for the jewellery in her possession.

24     In connection with her jewellery, the Wife had referred to 10 pawn tickets exhibited in her third affidavit as evidence that she had pawned her jewellery upon the Husband’s demand in the past to borrow monies for his use and that she remained responsible for “renewing (else the jewellery will be forfeited)”. However, a perusal of these 10 tickets showed the following:

> (a)     the date the jewellery was pawned was indicated as 19 December 2018 (which was about 6 months after Interim Judgment was granted on 28 June 2018) and the redemption date was indicated as 18 June 2019;

> (b)     the Wife’s name was stated as the name of the person who had pawned the items in 6 of the pawn tickets (for a total sum of $7,600), but only 4 of these 6 tickets were signed;

> (c)     the Husband’s name was stated as the name of the person who had pawned the items in 4 of the pawn tickets (for a total sum of $8,600), but only 1 of these 4 pawn tickets was signed and the signature on this 1 ticket appeared to be the same as that found on the 4 tickets mentioned in sub-paragraph (b) above, and

> (d)     the signatures found on all the 6 pawn tickets mentioned in sub-paragraphs (b) and (c) above appeared to be the Wife’s (not the Husband’s) as they appeared to be the same as her signature in her affidavits.

Based on the above observations and in the absence of clear and cogent evidence and explanations from the Wife, I did not include the values of the jewellery reflected in these 10 pawn tickets as forming part of the matrimonial assets. As at the hearing in July 2019 (which was after the redemption date), there was no evidence before me on the status of these pawn tickets, whether they had been redeemed or not. I also did not accept these 10 pawn tickets as supporting her assertion that the Husband had unilaterally taken the Wife’s jewellery and pawned them for his own benefit.

#### Existing Home as part of matrimonial assets

25     I turn next to the issue of the Existing Home. As the Existing Home was purchased in 1998 during the subsistence of the marriage, it fell within the definition of the term “matrimonial asset” in section 112 (10) of the Women’s Charter. However, the Wife contended that the Existing Home should be _excluded_ from the pool of matrimonial assets for division.

26     According to the Wife, she and the Husband had each received a sum of $137,000 from the sale proceeds of their First Home. She had reinvested a sum of $80,000 from her share towards renovation and improvement of the Existing Home, whilst the Husband had used his sum of $137,000 exclusively for himself. She claimed that the Husband did not contribute anything towards the Existing Home, financially or otherwise, despite living there for more than 20 years since 1998. He also did not give her any financial support for the maintenance of the family and the household all these years. She was the sole caregiver of the Son since his birth and she alone supported the Son financially from birth until he started working.

27     The Wife submitted that the Existing Home had been acquired solely by her own efforts, using her CPF monies and cash exclusively (after the sale of the First Home) and that “for reasons best known to him, the \[Husband\] voluntarily recused himself from purchasing a new flat in joint names with \[her\]”.[^4] In her second affidavit, the Wife stated that the Husband “voluntarily, willingly and intentionally did not purchase the \[Existing Home\] in our joint names as he wanted to prevent his share of $137,000 from being re-invested into the \[Existing Home\] as he wanted to relieve himself of his personal financial burdens or for whatever reasons”.

28     Whilst the court’s power to divide any matrimonial assets under section 112 (1) and (2) of the Women’s Charter is a discretionary power (_Ong Boon Huat Samuel v Chan Mei Lan Kristine_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] SGCA 19</span> at \[25\]-\[26\] (“**Ong Boon Huat**”), having considered the evidence before me carefully, I did not think that this was a case where I should exercise my discretion to exclude the Existing Home from the pool of matrimonial assets for division.

29     In coming to this decision, I was mindful of the caution sounded by the Court of Appeal in _NK v NL_ \[2007\] 3 SLR (R) 743 at \[40\] and reiterated by the High Court in _Chan Pui Yim v Lim Tiong Kei_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGHC 200</span> at \[18\] that any attempt to exclude particular assets from the overall computation has to be strictly scrutinised as the Court’s overarching duty is to achieve a just and equitable division in all the circumstances of the case.

30     The Wife’s counsel submitted that the Existing Home should be excluded as the present case was similar to _Ong Boon Huat._ I did not agree. In _Ong Boon Huat_, it was a very short marriage of about 19 months and the facts were unusual. In that case, the wife had made it very clear from the outset that she wanted to have no part in the purchase of a property (‘B’) and she wanted all liabilities associated with it to be borne by the husband. When the husband could not agree with her, she withdrew from the purchase and the husband went ahead with the purchase of the property in his sole name in May 2003. It should be noted that at this time, the parties’ marriage had already broken down. The wife then filed the (second) divorce petition shortly thereafter, in July 2003. It was in these circumstances that the Court of Appeal had determined that the disputed property should not be included in the matrimonial asset pool for division and consequently that the wife should not get a share of the property. The Court of Appeal stated that its determination to exclude the disputed property from the pool was the only one that was consistent with the wife’s position from the beginning that she was to have no part in the purchase of the property and that all liabilities associated therewith would be borne by the husband. At \[20-21\] of its decision, the Court of Appeal stated this:

> _“20_      _In our view, it is evident that the Wife had from the beginning wholly dissociated herself from the purchase of ‘B’. She testified in her first affidavit … that the purchase of the property was the Husband’s idea and she had only agreed to be a party to the mortgage because the Husband was unable to obtain financing in his sole name. At the time, the parties’ relationship had already deteriorated._

> _21_      _After the parties’ relationship had broken down, the Wife had made her intentions exceptionally clear by seeking to enter into a legally binding agreement which would confirm that she would not be responsible for any liabilities arising from ‘B’. In a letter from the wife’s solicitors dated 4 April 2003 in which the Deed was proposed, it was made clear that the Wife would execute the mortgage documents to avoid the parties being sued by the developers of ‘B’, but only on the basis that the Husband would be solely responsible for the financial costs of the purchase and would indemnify her against any claims made in relation to that property. Her solicitors gave the Husband one day to accept these terms and in the absence of such acceptance, the letter stated that the Wife would reserve her rights to seek an indemnity from the Husband for any losses, costs and damages sustained by her. When the Husband refused to enter into the Deed, the Wife put her intentions into effect by completely withdrawing from the purchase.”_

31     The present case was very unlike _Ong Boon Huat_. It was not disputed that the parties continued to live in the Existing Home as a matrimonial home for the next 20 years before the Wife filed for divorce in April 2018 and they were still living in the Existing Home at the time the Interim Judgement was granted in 2018.

32     I was also unable to accept the Wife’s broad and bare assertions that for the entire duration of their 36 – year marriage, the Husband had not made any contributions (financial or otherwise) towards the maintenance of the family or the household.

33     It should be noted that when the First Home was sold in 1998, the parties had agreed to share the sale proceeds equally. At the relevant time, the parties had been married for 16 years. In my view, the agreement then for the equal sharing of the sale proceeds from the First Home was telling. It was not

consistent with the picture that the Wife was painting (now) of a totally irresponsible father and husband for the entire duration of the marriage. The Wife did not provide any reason why she was willing to share the sale proceeds with the Husband if he was, as alleged by her, a totally irresponsible father and husband and had not made any contributions to the family and or the First Home. In addition, I noted that whilst she had stated on affidavit in no uncertain terms that he had not contributed a single cent towards the purchase of the First Home or the mortgage repayments, the Husband was able to produce the 1998 completion statements for the sale of the First Home to show that the Wife had lied on this point. At the hearing, the Wife’s counsel accepted that the completion documents for the First Home showed that the Husband had contributed a sum of $22,098.17 towards the purchase of the First Home. I noted that the Wife had also claimed that their First Home was completely paid up at the time of sale. She had alleged that this was a reason why the Husband had pressed for its sale. Again, this claim that the First Home had been fully paid up was shown to be untrue. The completion statements revealed that the First Home was still under mortgage at the time of sale.

34     Whilst the Wife had alleged that the sale of the First Home in 1998 was as a result of the Husband’s complex financial difficulties and that his inability to buy the Existing Home or his refusal to buy the Existing Home jointly with her was also because of his debt position, these were again just her bare allegations. I noted that the Wife did not provide any details or supporting evidence to substantiate her allegations.

35     The Husband had disputed the Wife’s claim that the sale of their First Home was due to his financial problems. He denied that he had financial difficulties and that he was unable to or had refused to purchase the Existing Home with her in 1998 after the sale of the First Home. As mentioned earlier (at paragraph 13(i) above), it was his evidence that it was by mutual agreement that the Existing Home was bought in her sole name in this way, with him doing his part by paying for the household and the family’s expenses as before.

36     I noted that the Wife did not dispute that the Husband was running his food-stall business from 1982 to 2015. In 1998, when the First Home was sold and the Existing Home was bought, he was running a food-stall in the Tekka market on a sub-let basis and he had done so since 1993, and thereafter, he had continued to do so until about 2015.

37     Given the above, I accepted that both parties had been income-earning spouses up to 2015 (before the Husband lost his stall at Tekka market and started his part-time jobs) during their long marriage. I also accepted that the Husband (by the very nature of his business) dealt in cash. As such, it was very likely and not unbelievable that the Husband would have given the Wife cash for the household and the family’s expenses during this period from 1982 to 2015. I noted that the Husband had maintained that since 1982 to 2015, he had been providing the Wife cash of $700 to $1500 per month, depending on his business, and had also given her during this period, other ad hoc amounts for herself and the upkeep of household and he had also contributed in other ways to the family and the homes (see paragraph 13 above).

38     I noted that the Husband was also able to produce some documentary evidence in support of his case:

> (a)     He had produced an invoice dated 23 December 1998 which proved that he had paid a sum of $1,500 (cash) for “whole house shifting services” from his First Home to the Existing Home.

> (b)     He had also provided documentary evidence to show that he had in fact bought a Homeshield Insurance Policy for the Existing Home sometime in March 2017. He had paid for the monthly premiums of this policy for an entire year. The policy (which was to insure the contents of the Existing Home and its renovations) was terminated in March 2018.

39     Finally, in relation to the adoption of the Son, whilst the Wife had disputed certain aspects of the Husband’s account, she did not deny that it was the Husband who had initiated the whole process and that it was through his own efforts (time and money) that the Son was first brought to Singapore from Malaysia to live with them, that he had wanted very much to adopt the Son and she had eventually agreed with him to do so. The Son is now an adult and working but continues to live with them at the Existing Home.

40     For the reasons set out above, the Wife was not able to satisfy me on the evidence that this was a proper case for me to exclude the Existing Home from the matrimonial pool for division.

#### The sum of $137,000 from the sale of the First Home

41     Counsel for the Wife then argued that if the Existing Home was to be regarded as part of the pool of matrimonial assets for division, then the Husband’s share of the sale proceeds from the First Home ($137,000) ought to be included as part of his assets and added to those agreed assets referred to earlier at paragraph 16. This was because there was no explanation by the Husband as to how he had squandered away the money. Counsel for the Wife sought to rely on the case of _AJR v AJS_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGHC 199</span> where the High Court had held that where a party in divorce proceedings had ‘_indulged in certain vices involving a large amount of expenditure (eg. excessive gambling or drinking to the extent that matrimonial assets have been unfairly or unjustly depleted by the unacceptable actions of that party_”, such dissipated monies could be notionally added to the total net amount of the matrimonial assets if it was just and equitable to do so.

42     In this case, there was again only the Wife’s bare allegation that the Husband had squandered his monies. It should be noted that he had stated in his AOM and his second affidavit how he had used his $137,000 (see paragraph 13 above). The investment of $80,000 into his food business was not unbelievable given the undisputed fact that he had then continued to run his food-stall at Tekka market for another 15 years (from 1998 to 2015). He had spent $15,000 taking the Wife and his mother and his sister’s family to India for a family vacation. This again was not an unreasonable or unbelievable sum to spend given that it was for more than 4 people and would have included all their accommodation, airfare and food. Then, there was a reference to a sum of $30,000 that he had paid to her for the renovations to the Existing Home. This payment was given to her for the payment to the contractor (I noted here that the Wife had claimed that the $80,000 spent on the renovations came entirely from her $137,000). And, finally, there was reference that he had over many months thereafter, also used the monies for payments to her for the upkeep of the home. Importantly, he was able to show documentary evidence that he had paid in cash ($1500) in 1998 for the shifting of the whole house from the First Home to the Existing Home in 1998. This was in my view strong evidence that he was clearly contributing to the family then and involved in the purchase of the Existing Home.

43     On balance and as the Wife had been shown to have been less than honest in her claims and disclosures, I was prepared to accept the Husband’s evidence that he had not squandered away his money. I was mindful that the sum was given in 1998 and as at Interim Judgment _about 20 years_ have passed. The Husband had also disclosed his bank statements as ordered and they did not show him to be a man of means. As such, I did not agree that there was a basis for the full sum of $137,000 to be added to the Husband’s assets now.

#### Valuation of the Existing Home

44     On the valuation of the Existing Home, I accepted the Wife’s counsel’s submission at the hearing in July 2019 that its market value was currently around $435,000 based on the resale flat price of a similar unit in the same block of flats in December 2018 (published by HDB on its website as at 11 July 2019).

45     I turn now to the issue of the Wife’s liability arising from the loan of $50,000 from ST Co-Op. Whilst she stated that she had received the loan in June 2017 and showed a statement that, as of 1 May 2019, there was still an outstanding balance of about $30,795 owing to ST Co-Op, she did not provide any supporting documents to substantiate the use of this sum except again for the very bare statements below:

> (a)     $12,000 on redemption of “the \[Husband’s\] and mother’s jewellery”;

> (b)     about $5,000 on redemption of some of her jewellery;

> (c)     $5,000 on replacement and purchase of items, furniture and fittings;

> (d)     $7,000 on a holiday with the Son; and

> (e)     rest of the monies (about $21,000) on living and festivity expenses.

Given that it was a mere 10 months before the filing of the divorce, and the lack of clear and cogent evidence, I was not prepared to factor this alleged liability into the computation of the pool of assets.

46     For all the reasons stated above, and given the values agreed by parties and those determined by the Court for the various asset items stated above, the pool of matrimonial assets for division may be summarised as follows:

**Table A – Pool of Matrimonial Assets as determined by this Court**

47     Given that I had found that it was a dual-income long marriage, the structured approach for the division of matrimonial assets in _ANJ v ANK_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 1043</span> (“**_ANJ_**”) was applied. Both counsel had also made submissions using this approach. The approach in _ANJ_ was summarised in _TIT v TIU_ (2016) 3 SLR 1137 at \[21\] as follows:

> “(a)     express as a ratio the parties’ direct contributions relative to each other, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets;

> (b)     express as a second ratio the parties indirect contributions relative to each other, having regard to both financial and non-financial contributions; and

> (c)     derive the parties’ overall contributions relative to each other by taking an average of the 2 ratios above (the derived ratio shall be referred to as “the average ratio”), keeping in mind that, depending on the circumstances of each case, the direct and indirect contributions may not be accorded equal weight, and one of the two ratios may be accorded more significance than the other. Adjustments could also be made in respect of other relevant factors under s 112 or s 114(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the Charter”).”

#### Direct Contributions

48     In terms of the direct contributions of the parties to the pool, this was determined as shown below in Table B:

**Table B**

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="24.3%"> <col width="36.48%"> <col width="39.22%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="b" colspan="3" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Direct Contributions (in S$)</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Wife</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Husband</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Existing Home</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">314,823.65 as of October 2018<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> [based on CPF documents]</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">50,000 (renovations)</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">30,000 (renovations)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Other Matrimonial Assets in the Pool</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">276,546.35 (see Table A)</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">53,710.56 (see Table A)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Total</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">641,370 (88.5 %)</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">83,710.56 (11.5%)</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Final Ratio</b></p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>89% (rounded up)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>11%</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

49     In respect of the renovations and improvements to the Existing Home, the Wife had alleged that $80,000 had been spent on this item but she had not been able to produce any supporting proof of her claim that the full sum was paid from her monies. As the Husband did not dispute that $80,000 had been spent, but had only stated that he had given her $30,000 (from his $137,000) to pay the contractor, I was prepared to accept that for this item, $50,000 came from her funds, and $30,000 came from his as shown in Table B.

50     As for the inclusion of the other sums in Table B as direct contributions to the pool by each party, these were accepted by the Wife as seen from the Wife’s supplementary submissions (Table 8) except that some adjustments were made to these amounts by the Wife’s counsel at the hearing in July 2019. As can be seen, the only difference was that I had rejected the Wife’s submission to add back a sum of $137,000 as part of the Husband’s assets. My reasons for its exclusion have been set out in paragraphs 41 to 43 above.

#### Indirect Contributions

51     On the parties’ indirect contributions to the welfare of the family and the marriage, the Wife’s counsel submitted that the ratio to be applied should be 80:20 in favour of the Wife. This was the Wife’s position notwithstanding her allegations that the Husband had been an absent father and husband who had not contributed any amount to the family and the matrimonial homes for the entire duration of the 36-year marriage and she alone had had to bear the financial burdens of the family and she alone had brought up the Son. The Husband’s counsel, on the other hand, contended that the ratio of their indirect contributions should at least be equal given his contributions over the length of their marriage.

52     As I have set out in the preceding paragraphs, I did not accept the Wife’s position and submissions. On balance, I accepted the Husband’s evidence that he had contributed in various ways to the family and the household as summarised in paragraph 13. He had substantiated his claims with some documentary evidence which had disproved the Wife’s claims that he had made no contributions at all during their marriage whether to their homes or family. I noted that his financial contributions towards the family and household were made whilst he was running his food business from 1982 to 2015 (for about 33 years) and he had very frankly acknowledged that it was within a range ($700 to $1500) and much depended on his business. He did not claim to have contributed financially thereafter when he took on his various part-time jobs, except to say that he had driven the Wife to work at her primary school when he was working as an Uber driver. I noted that by 2015 when the Husband started taking on part-time jobs, he was already about 60 years old and had some health issues. I noted also the undisputed evidence of the Husband’s efforts in adopting the Son in 1989 and that the Son in his 30s was now gainfully employed and still living at home at the time of the hearing in 2019. The Husband admitted that he had left it to his Wife to manage the expenses with his monthly contributions during the marriage and he did not dispute his Wife’s many contributions in bringing up the Son. He also acknowledged that her financial contributions were more as she was a teacher and her income was higher and more regular than his during the marriage. But, he had done his part within his abilities during the years from 1982 to 2015 (as set out in paragraph 13). Having regard to all these circumstances and taking into consideration all the evidence and the length of the marriage, I was of the view that for indirect contributions, a ratio of 60:40 in favour of the Wife was fair and equitable.

#### Average ratio of contributions

53     Based on the ratios determined for both the direct and indirect contributions, I then arrived at the overall average of 74.5 (for the Wife): 25.5 (for the Husband) as set out below in Table C.

**Table C**

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="24.3048609721944%"> <col width="35.5071014202841%"> <col width="40.1880376075215%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Wife (%)</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Husband (%)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Direct Contributions</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">89</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">11</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Indirect Contributions</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">60</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">40</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Overall Average</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">74.5</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">25.5</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

54     I was not minded to make any further adjustments to this overall average ratio. On a broad brush approach, having regard to all the facts in this case, this ratio of 74.5 (for the Wife): 25.5 (for the Husband) represented in my view a fair and equitable division of the parties’ matrimonial assets.

## Apportionment of assets - Final Order

55     In monetary terms, this translated to a sum of $174,980.21 to the Husband, based on the total net pool of assets valued at $686,196.91 (see Table A at paragraph 46). Both counsel then requested for time to work on the options to carry out the division. At the next hearing, I was informed by the Wife’s counsel that the Wife had decided to retain (and not sell) the Existing Home.

56     Taking into account the Husband’s existing assets and based on the values determined earlier, it was confirmed that the balance sum to be paid by the Wife to the Husband for his share was $121,126.51. However, the parties could not agree on how this balance sum was to be paid. The Wife wanted the whole sum to be paid from the monies in her CPF accounts into his CPF accounts. Counsel for the Husband however urged the Court to give the Husband a part of the monies in cash. It was submitted that the Husband (who was in his 60s and not in good health) would be in need of monies to rent some accommodation for himself and to sustain himself when he moved out from the Existing Home. He would also need some monies for his second operation that was coming up in September. If the full sum was paid into his CPF accounts, the monies would be locked up for his retirement. I did not think this request on the Husband’s part to be an unreasonable one in the circumstances. I accepted that the Husband should receive a part of his share in cash. I therefore ordered that he was to receive $30,000 in cash and the balance was to be paid by way of a transfer of monies from the Wife’s CPF accounts into his CPF accounts.

56     As such, the final orders as set out in **Annex A** were granted to give effect to the division that was ordered.

**Attached: Annex A**

**ANNEX A**

(1)    Pursuant to section 112 of the Women’s Charter, the pool of matrimonial assets was to be divided in the **proportion of 74:5 (Wife): 25.5 (Husband)**. This was to be effected as follows:

> (a)     the Wife was to retain the matrimonial home at XX (“**the Flat**”) held in in her sole name; and

> (b)     the Husband was to be paid a sum of $121,126.51 by the Wife. Of this sum, a sum of $30,000 cash was to be paid by the Wife within 3 months of the date of final judgment for the divorce (“**Final Judgment**”) and the balance amount of $91,126.51 (“**Ordered Amount**”) was to be paid by way of a transfer of CPF monies standing in the Wife’s CPF account(s) to the Husband’s CPF account as set out below in (c),

> (c)     the CPF Board shall from the monies standing to the credit of the Wife in the Wife’s following CPF account(s) transfer the amounts specified as follows to the Husband’s CPF account:

> In the event that there was a shortfall in the above CPF transfer of the Ordered Amount, the Wife was to pay the Husband the shortfall in cash, and

> (d)     the name of the Husband was to be removed as a permitted occupier of the Flat upon final payment by the Wife of the amounts set out in sub-paragraph (1)(b) above.

(2)    Save as set out in sub-paragraph (1)(b) above, the parties were to retain all other assets that were held in their respective names.
